Tools shape what we eat, but they have also transformed how we consume, and how we think about, our food. In Consider the Fork, award-winning food writer Bee Wilson provides a wonderful and witty tour of the evolution of cooking around the world, revealing the hidden history of everyday objects we often take for granted. Technology in the kitchen does not just mean the Pacojets and sous-vide of the modernist kitchen, but also the humbler tools of everyday cooking and eating: a wooden spoon and a skillet, chopsticks and forks. Blending history, science, and anthropology, Wilson reveals how our culinary tools and tricks came to be, and how their influence has shaped modern food culture. The story of how we have tamed fire and ice and wielded whisks, spoons, and graters, all for the sake of putting food in our mouths, Consider the Fork is truly a book to savor.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; History&gt; Ancient&gt; Early Civilization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1985d1908fdc9f75858f4f33c76a573ed69e127c","amp;dn":"Consider+the+Fork_+A+History+of+How+We+Cook+and+Eat+-+Wilson%2C+Be","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1985d1908fdc9f75858f4f33c76a573ed69e127c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,133,209,144,143,220,159,117,133,143,79,51,199,106,87,62,214,158,18,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
