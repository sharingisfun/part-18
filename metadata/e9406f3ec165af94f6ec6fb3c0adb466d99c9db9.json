The essays place famous authors such as Samuel Coleridge, Oscar Wilde, and William Butler Yeats in new contexts; reassess overlooked members of writing partnerships; and throws new light on texts marginalized due to their collaborative nature.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\n&quot;A terrific book, carefully and helpfully theorized, wonderfully researched, lucidly written, and filled with unexpected couplings, insights, and pleasures.&quot; - Susan J. Leonardi, University of Maryland&quot;\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nMarjorie Stone is assistant dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and professor of English and women's studies at Dalhousie University.
