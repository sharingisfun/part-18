We hear signs of his gradual gravitation toward pop right off the bat with the churchy R&amp;B cover of Paul Simon's mega-hit &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; dominated by Valerie Simpson's florid soul vocal and a gospel choir.  His roots fixation surfaces in the spell-like African groove of the title track, a dramatic tone poem that ebbs and flows masterfully over its 13-minute length.  From this point on, it's all jazz; the roaring big band comes back with a vengeance in &quot;Walkin',&quot; where Milt Jackson, Herbie Hancock, Hubert Laws, and other jazzers take fine solo turns, and things really get rocking on Nat Adderley's &quot;Hummin'. &quot; Major Holley is a riot with his grumble-scat routine on bass.  The whole record sounds like they must have had a ball recording it.  - by Richard S.
