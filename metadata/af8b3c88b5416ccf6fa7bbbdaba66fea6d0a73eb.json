Gaddis motivates the study of both programming skills and the C++ programming language by presenting all the details needed to understand the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but never losing sight of the fact that most beginners struggle with this material. His approach is both gradual and highly accessible, ensuring that students understand the logic behind developing high-quality programs.\n\nIn Starting Out with C++: Early Objects, Gaddis covers objects and classes early after functions and before arrays and pointers. As with all Gaddis texts, clear and easy-to-read code listings, concise and practical real-world examples, and an abundance of exercises appear in every chapter. This text is intended for either a one-semester accelerated introductory course or a traditional two-semester sequence covering C++ programming.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
