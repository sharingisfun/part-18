This Anglicism is even more present in the lyrics and delivery, the songs are rich in atmosphere and firmly located in modern England, and her vocal delivery is unaffected and natural.\nMusically this is a quiet and restrained album, the constants throughout are MarthaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acoustic guitar and piano work and these are fleshed out by a wide variety of backing that includes cello, violin, flute and percussion.\nThe songs are all strong and contain and a striking attention to detail, many of the songs focus on small moments and she draws the listener in by concentrating on information most other songwriters overlook.\nThis is a genuine, honest and heartfelt album thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s full of excellent songs with memorable melodies that stand out due to their English references and feel. An excellent album.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ae55faeac7458176b6434d1ca6e1dcecc76a78","amp;dn":"Martha+Tilston...Bimbling%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ae55faeac7458176b6434d1ca6e1dcecc76a78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,174,85,250,234,199,69,129,118,182,67,77,28,166,225,220,236,199,106,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
