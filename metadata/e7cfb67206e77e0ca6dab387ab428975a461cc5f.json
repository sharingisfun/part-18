Godard continues his exemplary journey into the unexpected, the unconventional, confounding, but with a paradoxically deliberate pull into the first hand experience of the mystery, not through a narrative telling, but in the evocation of the quick-cut images themselves. Despite the aphorisms and many linguistic delights that tease the mind, its the dense black and white film in the first half of the movie and the sudden shift to digital video color (symbolic, in its gaudiness, of the distortion that occurs in memory) that create effective impact.\n\nIn its content, the maturation process, memory, history, politics, resistance to the pseudo. and above all art in its many forms are dealt with largely through the eyes of the artist/creator...with a sense of note-taking and exploration. In its anti-Americanism there tends to be exaggeration and projection...although a wise comment (&quot;They&amp;#039;re just like us.&quot; i.e., the French) is a saving one.\n\nThe performances are splendid...totally believable with an almost documentary realism.\n\nFor any film-goer interested in imaginative, challenging movie fare this shouldn&amp;#039;t be missed. [/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE]Jean-Luc Godard&amp;#039;s eagerly awaited Eloge de l&amp;#039;Amour was one of the highlights of the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, dividing critics between those who loved its extraordinary beauty and those who found it hard to discern an overall theme from a multitude of contending threads. Certainly the plot is elusive. A young writer (Bruno Putzulu) wants a dark-haired woman (Cecile Camp) to play a role in his evolving project, a study of the four stages of love: meeting, physical passion, separation and reconciliation. By the time the funding comes through, she has killed herself and he looks back to the time when he might, or might not have met her before.\n\nAbove all, the picture explores the blurred territory between the personal and the collective memory and the difference between a life which is simply lived and one in which the individual brings the power of imagination to their existence. Ultimately, the characters remain curiously faceless and the film fragments into a kaleidoscope of merging images, colours and landscapes and collective experience triumphs.\n\nGodard&amp;#039;s legendary status as the godfather of French New Wave cinema has long since passed into the realms of clichÃƒÂ©. Here, the &quot;present&quot; is shot on the streets of Paris in black and white. Godard&amp;#039;s city of light looks as timeless as it did back in 1966 when he made Masculin Feminin. The second part of the film is shot in digital video, absorbing the audience with its electrically intense, mesmerising colours.\n\nEloge de l&amp;#039;Amour is, more than anything, a sensual experience. Godard provokes but doesn&amp;#039;t provide any answers. But fans of his more polemical work will enjoy the satirised American producers who want to purchase the rights to the Resistance couple&amp;#039;s story. Americans have no memory, says the author. So they buy it from others. Godard never was a fence-sitter.[/QUOTE]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/11-4.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/22-4.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/33-3.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/44-4.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/55-4.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/66-4.png[/IMG]\n\n------my rip----\n\nI ripped the black &amp; white and color segments of the film separately. It was necessary to use CBR audio in order to join them properly.
