For the past 25 years, Ingrid Newkirk and People \nFor the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have tirelessly attacked one of the\npillars of civilization: mankind's use of animals. Ingrid and her supporters\nare driven by the single-minded conviction that humans must not use animals for\nany reason - not for food, clothing, medical experimentation, or even for \nentertainment. Ingrid works 18-hour days and lives in a one-bedroom apartment\nwith little furniture. She publicly hopes that mad cow disease will ravage the \ncountry; she believes a cure for AIDS is not worth the life of a single monkey; \nand when Ingrid dies, she wants her body dissected, eaten, and made into \nclothing - as a statement of solidarity with non-human animals. Having obtained \nunprecedented access to Ingrid and the activities of her organization, \nI Am An Animal thoroughly explores PETA's unconventional ideology and its militant\nand extreme tactics. To understand PETA's staying power and how it became the most\nsuccessful radical group in America, the film follows several present day actions\nin addition to examining past controversies. At its core, however, I Am An Animal\nis an intimate, provocative profile of one woman's private war on behalf of animals.
