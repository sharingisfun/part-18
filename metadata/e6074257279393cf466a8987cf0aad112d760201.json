Some bands have a sound that\nyou know will strike a chord with a lot of people. Sometimes there are\nbands that present themselves with such a professional outlook of the\nindustry that you can tell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“failureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is not in their vocabulary.\n\nIvyrise is both of these things. The brainchild of lead vocalist and\nsong writer Ben Falinski, Ivyrise bring a mix of what they call\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwidescreen stadium rock with radio friendly hooksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Falinkski\ncertainly knows how to write a catchy but epically scoped track. Their\nlead single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Line Up the StarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ has already attracted a song following.\nA combo of wistful piano, drums that could have come from BowieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“LowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nand an anthemic chorus. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an infectious indie-rock song that would\nsound welcome on any commercial radio station the length and breadth of\nthe land. At times they channel the more melancholy moments of Keane\nand Coldplay but temper it with shots of 30 Seconds From Mars and Biffy\nClyro. Those are some big names to be throwing around. But their names\nIvyrise sound very comfortable next to.\n\nHaving been together for a little over a year the band have already\nplayed to stadium sized crowds having supported Bon Jovi on their Lost\nHighway tour. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s these crowds they keep aiming to play for. Having\ngone the classic route of busking in order to get his music out there\nFalinski is determined the band should continue to make a name for\nthemselves. Touting tickets for their shows at other bands gigs they\nhave built a committed fan base who helped raise the money for the band\nto produce their first album. For the album they have hooked up with\nJason Perry (whose also worked with The Blackout and McFly).\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve not said anything about the rest of the band so far. Which is bad\non my part because they all bring the proverbial ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to the party. Dan\nTanner on guitar and vocals, Mark Nagle on bass and Josh Key brings the\ntribal drumming. On the recently released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Without YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ TannerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar\nstands out particularly as sounding grandiose and well capable of\nfilling the air of a stadium. Bringing some synths into the mix the\ngroup sound as though they are looking to quickly expand their sound\nrather than sitting in a comfortable little niche. Falinski too plays\nkeys for the band. Sounding very comfortable behind the piano he\ndemonstrates his skill on the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Last of the Broken HeartsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a solo\ntrack.\n\nWithout releasing an album or EP, Ivyrise have built a strong fan base\nbuilt around a clutch full of tracks. This is a band that have the\ntools and moxie to make something big of themselves. Give them a\nlisten, you can say you got in on the ground floor.\n\nTheir self-titled debut album will be released August 22nd, 2011.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6074257279393cf466a8987cf0aad112d760201","amp;dn":"Ivyrise-Ivyrise-%28Advance%29-2011-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6074257279393cf466a8987cf0aad112d760201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,7,66,87,39,147,147,207,70,106,137,135,207,10,173,17,45,118,2,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
