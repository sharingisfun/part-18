As he sharpens his skills, he gains surprising insight into the daunting challenges--physical, psychological, and intellectual--that pro athletes must master. \n\n   About the Author\nStefan Fatsis is The New York Times bestselling author of Word Freak. He is a sports reporter for The Wall Street Journal and a regular guest on National Public RadioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s All Things Considered.\n\n   From Publishers Weekly\nStarred Review. Fatsis (Word Freak) is dwarfed by any of the NFL athletes who put their bodies on the line each Sunday. But that doesn't stop him from asking to attend the Denver Broncos' training camp in hopes of learning one very specific athletic skillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that is, placekickingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and not to become an NFL-caliber kicker, but to become a credible one. Fatsis is treated like any rookie, from having to sing his alma mater's fight song minutes after stepping into the locker room to carrying the team's duffel bags and bunking in the hotel with all the other rookies. But his vibrant enthusiasm for improving his kicking ability helps his Bronco teammates accept him as one of their own. With that, the reader gets a glimpse of the true NFL, in the tradition of George Plimpton's Paper Lion. We see the crippling injuries that are kept secret for fear of losing playing time; the heartbreak of standing on the sidelines in camp, just aching to prove one's worth; the tears that come when the NFL dream could be over. Fatsis, too, has his own personal highs and lows through camp, enduring the long days, the trainer's visits and the sting of failure in front of coaches and players. It's an incredibly fascinating read for football fans, squashing the notion that the life of an NFL player is always glamorous.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e396e938237adadc02b265f3167497a1a9b383","amp;dn":"A+FEW+SECONDS+OF+PANIC+-+Stefan+Fatsis+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e396e938237adadc02b265f3167497a1a9b383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,227,150,233,56,35,122,218,220,2,178,101,243,22,116,151,161,169,179,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
