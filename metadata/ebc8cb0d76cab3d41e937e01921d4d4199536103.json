Shortly after he died, I heard the tape &quot;The Politics of Cancer Therapy&quot;, which is based on the second half of the book &quot;World Without Cancer&quot;. That tape was one of the best done presentations I&amp;#039;ve ever heard--about anything. It is about the takeover of the field of medical education by the drug industry, and explains why cures for cancer aren&amp;#039;t really of great interest to the medical field.\n\nThe tape was so fascinating that I immediately went out, bought the book, found that even better, and made the trip out to interview Mr. Griffin.\n\nMr. Griffin is extremely well informed, writes and speaks clearly and makes his subjects very easy to understand.\n\nIf you have any interest in either an effective treatment for cancer, in world politics, or in politics and the medical field you simply have to read this book. I cannot speak too highly of it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc8cb0d76cab3d41e937e01921d4d4199536103","amp;dn":"World+Without+Cancer++-+The+Story+of+Vitamin+B17+-+G.+Edward+Gri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc8cb0d76cab3d41e937e01921d4d4199536103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,200,203,13,118,202,179,212,30,147,126,1,146,29,77,65,153,83,97,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
