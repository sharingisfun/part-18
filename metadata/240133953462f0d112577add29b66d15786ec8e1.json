Anderson, and starring Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Kim Coates, Shawn Roberts,Spencer Locke, Boris Kodjoe, and Wentworth Miller. It is the fourth installment in a seriesof film adaptations based loosely on Capcom's survival horror video game series Resident Evil. In a world ravaged by a virus infection, turning its victims into the Undead, Alice (Jovovich), continues on her journey to find survivors and lead them to safety. Her deadly battle with the Umbrella Corporation reaches new heights, but Alice gets some unexpected help from an old friend. A new lead that promises a safe haven from the Undead takes them to Los Angeles, but when they arrive the city is overrun by thousands of Undead - and Alice and her comrades are about to step into a deadly trap.\n\nCAST: \nMilla Jovovich as Alice: A former Umbrella Corporation security officer whose exposure to the T-Virus granted her superhumanabilities. Since her escape from Raccoon City, she has been hunted by Umbrella, who intends to use her DNA in order to control the virus' mutation. Alice seeks to &quot;settle her score&quot; with Umbrella and its elusive chairman, Albert Wesker.[5][6]\nAli Larter as Claire Redfield: Chris' younger sister. She led a convoy of survivors who encountered Alice in the previous film. InAfterlife, Claire mysteriously finds herself alone in the woods and suffering from amnesia.[7]\nWentworth Miller as Chris Redfield: Claire's older brother. He is working with an unnamed military organization combating the infected. Chris and his unit were using a Los Angeles prison as a base of operations, before it was overrun and he was imprisoned.[8]When Miller first read the script he thought the association to Prison Break was a practical joke, with his imprisonment and his first line being, &quot;I know a way out of here&quot; but later came to see it as a chance to take the character to a different ending.[9]\nShawn Roberts as Albert Wesker: The Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He has been tracking Alice in order to discover means by which the T-Virus mutation can be controlled. His office is located in Tokyo, Japan, and he communicates with the company's other branches using holographic technology. Similar to his video game counterpart, Wesker possesses superhuman strength, speed, and regenerative capabilities.[8]\nSpencer Locke as K-Mart: Named after the department store she was discovered hiding in, K-Mart was a member of Claire Redfield's convoy of survivors in the previous film.[8]\nBoris Kodjoe as Luther West: A former professional basketball player and the leader of the survivors of Los Angeles. Kodjoe trained for six weeks to perform his own stunts. He dislocated his knee in the course of filming while trying to kick in a gate.[10]\nKim Coates as Bennett: A big-shot film producer who is strongly disliked by the group.\nKacey Barnfield as Crystal: A junior champ in swimming in her high school days. She came to Los Angeles to work as an actress.\nNorman Yeung as Kim Yong: Bennet's former intern before the virus outbreak.\nSergio Peris-Mencheta as Angel Ortiz: A former military operations soldier.\nSienna Guillory as Jill Valentine: A former STARS operative who assisted Alice and escaped Raccoon City in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Guillory, who portrayed the character in Apocalypse, reprises her role in the film.[11] She features briefly in a scene shown during the credits, setting up a potential sequel.\nRay Olubowale as AxeMan: A monster taken from the game Resident Evil 5.[\n\nProduct Description\nThe fourth installment of the hugely successful Resident Evil franchise, Resident Evil: Afterlife is again based on the wildly popular video game series. In a world ravaged by a virus infection, turning its victims into the Undead, Alice (Milla Jovovich), continues on her journey to find survivors and lead them to safety. Her deadly battle with the Umbrella Corporation reaches new heights, but Alice gets some unexpected help from an old friend. A new lead that promises a safe haven from the Undead takes them to Los Angeles, but when they arrive the city is overrun by thousands of Undead - and Alice and her comrades are about to step into a deadly trap.\nEnjoy for Chinese New Year.
