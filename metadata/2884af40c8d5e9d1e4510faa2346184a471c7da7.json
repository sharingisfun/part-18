Levis, Gus M. Garmel, &quot;Clinical Emergency Medicine Casebook&quot;\nCambridge University Press | 2009-04-06 | ISBN: 052171964X | 506 pages | PDF \n\nEmergency Medicine is not divided into specific areas of practice. Emergency room visitors come in all shapes and sizes, at any time of day or night, with a wide range of maladies. Emergency physicians need to become experts in diverse areas of medicine and to be able to make quick and informed decisions about patient care. A cornerstone of emergency medicine training is the constant drilling and re-drilling of simulated cases and clinical scenarios. This book offers a unique yet underutilized strategy for learning: a case-based approach from real patients and actual events. Each case provides the opportunity for learning essential clinical concepts. Focused exclusively on the needs of in-training emergency physicians and nurses, the book covers more than 100 common and unusual cases in emergency medicine. The procedures have been class-tested by the Stanford/Kaiser Emergency Medicine Residency Program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2884af40c8d5e9d1e4510faa2346184a471c7da7","amp;dn":"Clinical+Emergency+Medicine+Casebook+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2884af40c8d5e9d1e4510faa2346184a471c7da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,132,175,64,200,213,233,209,228,81,15,170,35,70,24,74,71,28,125,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
