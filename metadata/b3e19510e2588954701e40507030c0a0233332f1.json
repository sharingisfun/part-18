Dubstep and Classical music, together at last...Eleven tracks on this one, most of them centered around folks like Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart...including music by 16 bit, BogTroTTeR and Chase &amp; Status. Plus a few that aren't quite classical, but fit quite well...\n\n*note* Everyone is well aware that the first track features O Fortuna by Carl Orff, not Mozart, please just let it go and enjoy the music. Thank You.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3e19510e2588954701e40507030c0a0233332f1","amp;dn":"Classical+Dubstep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3e19510e2588954701e40507030c0a0233332f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,225,149,16,226,88,137,84,112,30,64,80,112,48,192,160,35,51,50,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
