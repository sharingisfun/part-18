He then goes through some fantastic photoshopped pics of Colin Quinn, talks about kids cursing, a suspension over at BET, and Jim Norton's new article for Time magazine. Ant tells a few marijuana stories, we watch country hip-hop dancing videos, talk about invasion of privacy, people's obsession with camera phones, and he ends the show talking about the Life Alert commercial. Oh yeah. And he also breaks Obama.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:263994506c6f776f7be3c2ebe45c98abcba99b21","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"263994506c6f776f7be3c2ebe45c98abcba99b21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,57,148,80,108,111,119,111,123,227,194,235,228,92,152,171,203,169,155,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
