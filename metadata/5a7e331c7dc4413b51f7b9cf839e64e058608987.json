I wonder what there is beyond them.\n\nSo, just joking, we started scavenging the big sea of junk of Internet.\nAnd we found a lot of jewels, scattered amongst forgotten torrents and streaming sites... We really felt like Indiana Jones after the discovery of some lost treasure.\nSo now you have it: a collection of more or less 140 albums which represent a fair sample of that unrepeteable moment that was in the 70s the Progressive Rock renaissance in Italy. Obscure groups, who often published an album only, but the musical level is really high. \nUsing the excellent progarchives.com site as a reference map, we recovered archaelogic witness that our country, that now lies under a deep layer of shit, had a glorious artistic past... \nNowadays we live under the shit, but we have developed excellent apnea techniques to survive :)\nAnd if we had such a past, we hope that in our forgotten culture there is the seed of a better future... \n\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps for the 95% of the albums.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a7e331c7dc4413b51f7b9cf839e64e058608987","amp;dn":"progressive+-+Indiana+Jones+And+The+Scavengers+of+Italy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a7e331c7dc4413b51f7b9cf839e64e058608987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,126,51,28,125,196,65,59,81,247,185,207,131,158,100,224,88,96,137,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
