To date, My Dying Bride\nhave released eleven full-length studio albums, three EPs, one demo, one box set, four compilation albums,\none live album, and one live CD/DVD release.\nAlong with Anathema and Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride is a forerunner of the death/doom metal genre and\nconsidered part of the &quot;Peaceville Three&quot; as all three bands were signed to Peaceville Records at the time.\nIt marked a radical departure from the band's first full length, As the Flower Withers. Martin Powell's violin\nplaying had become fully integrated into the band's sound, whilst vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe mixed death metal\ngrowls and grunts with the spoken word and an often plaintive singing voice. The first (&quot;Sear Me MCMXCIII&quot;)\nand final (&quot;Black God&quot;) tracks dispensed with electric guitar altogether, while the album was also far slower\nand longer than its predecessor. For these reasons, &quot;Turn Loose the Swans&quot; is often considered to be\nimportant in the development of the doom metal/death metal hybrid pioneered by My Dying Bride and fellow \nPeaceville bands Anathema and Paradise Lost.\n\n=================================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01 Sear Me MCMXCIII.flac\n02 Your River.flac\n03 The Songless Bird.flac\n04 The Snow In My Hand.flac\n05 The Crown Of Sympathy.flac\n06 Turn Loose The Swans.flac\n07 Black God.flac\n\nMy Dying Bride - Turn Loose The Swans.cue\nMy Dying Bride - Turn Loose The Swans.jpg\nMy Dying Bride - Turn Loose The Swans.log\nMy Dying Bride - Turn Loose The Swans.m3u\n\n===================================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 372 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Turn Loose The Swans\nTrack name/Total                         : 7\nComposer                                 : My Dying Bride\nGenre                                    : Death/Doom Metal\nRecorded date                            : 1993\nComment                                  : EAC V1.0 beta 2, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC -8\nAlbum/Composer                           : My Dying Bride / My Dying Bride\n\n=====================================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 940 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3e10f571d3bf0b09e15f1ca629c27f37948ddff","amp;dn":"My+Dying+Bride+-+Turn+Loose+The+Swans+%281993%29+FLAC-Cue+-+ausy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3e10f571d3bf0b09e15f1ca629c27f37948ddff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,225,15,87,29,59,240,176,158,21,241,202,98,156,39,243,121,72,221,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
