Find out in this riveting sequel to The Remedy and companion to the New York Times bestselling The Treatment and The Program.\r\n\r\nIn a world before The Programâ€¦\r\n\r\nQuinlan McKee has spent her life acting as other people. She was a closerâ€”a person hired to play the role of the recently deceased in order to give their families closure. Through this process, Quinn learned to read people and situations, even losing a bit of herself to do so. But she couldnâ€™t have guessed how her last case would bring down her entire world.\r\n\r\nThe only person Quinn trusts is Deacon, her best friend and the love of her life. Except Deaconâ€™s been keeping secrets of his one, so Quinn must set out alone to find Arthur Pritchard, the doctor whoâ€™s been trying to control her life. The journey brings Quinn to Arthurâ€™s daughter, Virginia, who tells Quinn the truth about Pritchardâ€™s motives. The former closer will start to see that she is the first step in fighting an epidemic.\r\n\r\nBut Quinlan doesnâ€™t want to be a cure. And with all the lies surrounding her, she realizes she has no one left to rely on but herselfâ€”even if she doesnâ€™t know who that is anymore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73784111b6a5e8f95b8ba94f245d2351d5e6f5c","amp;dn":"The+Epidemic+by+Suzanne+Young+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73784111b6a5e8f95b8ba94f245d2351d5e6f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,55,132,17,27,106,94,143,149,184,186,148,242,69,210,53,29,94,111,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
