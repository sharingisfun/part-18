This Cookbook offers practical solutions for using the Java implementation of the Ruby language, with targeted recipes for deploying Rails web applications on Java servers, integrating JRuby code with Java technologies, developing JRuby desktop applications with Java toolkits, and more. Using numerous reusable code samples, JRuby Cookbook shows you how to:\n\n- Install and update JRuby on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and IDEs such as NetBeans and Eclipse\n- Package and deploy Rails apps on Java Servlet containers and Java EE application servers, including JBoss, Tomcat, and GlassFish\n- Integrate Ruby and Rails applications with popular Java EE technologies such as JMS, JMX, JPA, Spring, and Hibernate\n- Develop desktop and client applications with cross-platform Java UI technologies and toolkits such as Swing, SWT, and Java 2D\n- Maximize the flexibility of your testing and build environment, using both existing Java-based tools such as Ant and Maven and newer Ruby-based tools such as Rake, Raven, and Buildr\n\nThe JRuby interpreter combines RubyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simplicity and ease of use with JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive libraries and technologies, a potent blend that opens new possibilities for Ruby, Rails, and Java. This Cookbook helps you take full advantage of JRubyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potential.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The JRuby Cookbook is an excellent book for any polyglot who is trying to bridge the gap between Java and Ruby. It provides solutions to specific problems developers face in both their development and testing environments, along with the applications theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re building.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bob McWhirter, Research &amp; Prototyping, Red Hat Middleware\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
