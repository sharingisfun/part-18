Grymes\nTorrent file name: Violins of Hope (James A. Grymes) Retail epub [Itzy]\nPublisher: Harper Perennial (August 12, 2014)\nSold by: HarperCollins Publishers\nGenre: Non-fiction\nFormat: Retail .epub\n\nA stirring testament to the strength of the human spirit and the power of music, Violins of Hope tells the remarkable stories of violins played by Jewish musicians during the Holocaust, and the Israeli violin maker dedicated to bringing these inspirational instruments back to life.\n\nThe violin has formed an important aspect of Jewish culture for centuries, both as a popular instrument with classical Jewish musiciansÃ¢â‚¬â€Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menuhin, Itzhak PerlmanÃ¢â‚¬â€and also a central factor of social life as part of the enduring Klezmer tradition. But during the Holocaust, the violin assumed extraordinary new roles within the Jewish community. For some musicians, the instrument was a liberator; for others, it was a savior that spared their lives. For many, the violin provided comfort in mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darkest hour, and, in at least one case, helped avenge murdered family members. Above all, the violins of the Holocaust represented strength and optimism for the future.\n\nIn Violins of Hope, music historian James A. Grymes tells the amazing, horrifying, and inspiring story of the violins of the Holocaust, and of Amnon Weinstein, the renowned Israeli violinmaker who has devoted the past twenty years to restoring these instruments in tribute to those who were lost, including 400 members of his own family. Juxtaposing tales of individual violins with one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harrowing struggle to reconcile his own familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history and the history of his people, it is a poignant, affecting, and ultimately uplifting look at the Holocaust and its enduring impact.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01756f617a512bb247ca4149f0fa0a3fd4258f4","amp;dn":"Violins+of+Hope+%28James+A.+Grymes%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01756f617a512bb247ca4149f0fa0a3fd4258f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,23,86,246,23,165,18,187,36,124,164,20,159,15,160,163,253,66,88,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
