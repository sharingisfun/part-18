Episodes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were restored to colour via the chroma dot colour recovery technique used for other black-and-white Pertwee-era stories. The telerecording of episode 1 does not contain chroma dot information (this was filtered out at the time it was made), and was recoloured using colour referenced from the other restored episodes. Keyframes, including the first frame of a shot and every fifth frame thereafter (Approximately 7,000 total) were hand coloured by Stuart Humphryes. Motion-estimation software was then used to interpolate the extrapolated colour from the key frames into the intervening frames. \n\nDVD rip specs:\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: H264 @ 872 kbps\nResolution: 640 x 480 (4:3 aspect ratio)\n\nAUDIO: MP3 @ 128 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b1cfd7017f2e278136572926b2828ac2999f028","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+The+Mind+of+Evil+DVD-rip+%28Color%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b1cfd7017f2e278136572926b2828ac2999f028","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,28,253,112,23,242,226,120,19,101,114,146,107,40,40,172,41,153,240,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
