Several examples are used to illustrate the proportional changes in surface area and volume when objects are scaled up or down in size. Segment length: 39 minutes\n\n    Liquids I: The concepts of density, pressure, and the depth-dependence of liquid pressure are used to develop the concept of buoyancy. A variety of demonstrations are used to distinguish between the displacement, volume, weight, and density of immersed objects, and to illustrate Archimede's principle. Segment length: 39 minutes\n\n    Liquids II: This tape expands on the discussion of Archimede's principle in the Liquid's I tape, with an emphasis on the law of flotation. A variety of demonstrations help to illustrate these concepts. Segment length: 38 minutes\n\n    Gases: This demonstration-oriented lecture focuses on the atmosphere--its weight, pressure, and the buoyancy it exerts on objects. Barometer, Boyle's Law, and Bernoulli's principle are also discussed. Segment length: 40 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b28e525d9cd693eea43e20890a0fcef1d8fd47d","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Physics+Alive%21+-+Volume+6+-+Scaling%2C+Liquids+1%2C+Liqui","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b28e525d9cd693eea43e20890a0fcef1d8fd47d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,40,229,37,217,205,105,62,234,67,226,8,144,160,252,239,29,143,212,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
