The band's hits include covers of Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Blinded By The Light&quot; and &quot;Spirit In The Night&quot;. After forming in 1971 and despite a short hiatus in the late 80s/early 90s, the Earth Band has continued to perform and tour through the present.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n2006 is an album released in 2004 (see 2004 in music) by Manfred Mann with Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Manfred Mann preferred to point out that this is rather his solo album. His explanation for this is given in the sleeve notes, where he says that some of the tracks ('Mars', 'Two Friends', 'Two Brides', ' Slave', 'Frog' and 'Get Me Out Of This') were recorded in a more unrehearsed and experimental way than the others. Because of this, Mann preferred to present this outside the normal Earth Band context, as representative only of his personal tastes and not those of his Earth Band colleagues. He also remarks that the album title is not consistent with its release year (2004, or in some places 2005) because the resulting anachronism seems to him artistically interesting.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nManfred Mann: keyboards, vocals\nMick Rogers: guitars\nGeoff Dunn: drums\nSteve Kinch: bass\nNoel McCalla: vocals\n\nWith:\n\nChris Thompson: vocals\nThomas D: vocals\nMatt Loffstadt: guitars\nDon Freeman: poem and talking\nBarbara Thompson: saxophone\nDean Hart: bass, guitars, vocals\nHazel Hernandez: vocals\nMelanie Pappenheim: vocals\nArte Chorale: vocals\nHenry's Eight: vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:799dee6c98da48ceb07d2915d2e9d4e50349b4c9","amp;dn":"Manfred+Mann%27s%2F2006%5B2004%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D%5BLE%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"799dee6c98da48ceb07d2915d2e9d4e50349b4c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,157,238,108,152,218,72,206,176,125,41,21,210,233,212,229,3,73,180,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
