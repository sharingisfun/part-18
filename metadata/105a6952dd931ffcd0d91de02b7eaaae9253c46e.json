I'm Casey Kasem.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is one I found on the internet. It is a broadcast from Sirius XM. This is not a Premiere Radio Networks edit so there are no extras.\n\nOriginally broadcast on July 1st, 1978, this is American Top 40's Top 40 Hits of the Disco Era.\n\nIn this countdown there are 2 instrumentals and 2 remakes, and even a song by the Rolling Stones.\n\nI've included the cue sheet for this show (in JPG format). You can currently find cue sheets for almost every AT40 broadcast at the link provided in the notepad text.\n\nCasey also recounts the first day of the disco era, the very first disco hit, and how the disco single originated.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nEXTRA:   Rock The Boat - The Hues Corporation (First #1 disco song - 1974)\n40: Love To Love You Baby - Donna Summer (#2 - 1976)\n39: Shake Your Groove Thing - Peaches and Herb (#5 - 1979)\n38: (Every Time I Turn Around) Back In Love Again - L.T.D.
