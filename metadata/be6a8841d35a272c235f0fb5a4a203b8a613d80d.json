The contributions address subjects in convexity and discrete geometry, in distance geometry or with geometrical flavor in combinatorics, graph theory or non-linear analysis. Written by top experts, these papers highlight the close connections between these fields, as well as ties to other domains of geometry and their reciprocal influence. They offer an overview on recent developments in geometry and its border with discrete mathematics, and provide answers to several open questions. The volume addresses a large audience in mathematics, including researchers and graduate students interested in geometry and geometrical problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6a8841d35a272c235f0fb5a4a203b8a613d80d","amp;dn":"Convexity+and+Discrete+Geometry+Including+Graph+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6a8841d35a272c235f0fb5a4a203b8a613d80d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,106,136,65,211,90,39,44,35,95,15,181,164,162,3,184,166,19,216,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
