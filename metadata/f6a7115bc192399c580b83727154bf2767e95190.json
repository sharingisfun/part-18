Due to their heavy use of German lyrics, imagery and German sounding pseudonyms they are often mistaken for a Neue Deutsche HÃƒÂ¤rte band but are actually based in New York City to which founding members Kaizer Von Loopy and Vas Kallas are native.\n\n\nHanzel und Gretyl formed in early 1993. In 1994, they completed a demo entitled &quot;Kindermusik&quot;. Of the 200 cassette tapes manufactured, most were sent to record labels and magazines and some were sold on consignment at a local music store called Bleeker Bob's. After refusing an offer from at least one major label to resubmit their demo with only English lyrics, they signed with Energy Records, an indie record label based in New York City, in January 1995. They recorded and released their first full-length album, Ausgeflippt, in October 1995. With lyrics in five different languages and no two songs sounding alike, the album made a clear statement as deviating from the often predictable and monochromatic themes of many electro and industrial bands of the time. The single &quot;Shine 2001&quot; topped the Alternative Press dance chart at No. 1 shortly after its release. Performing only several local shows on Manhattan's lower east side, they immediately embarked on two U.S. tours with Marilyn Manson. The first in 1995 with Clutch as direct support and again in 1996 as direct support for Manson themselves.\n\n\nIn 1997, they released their second full length album, Transmissions From Uranus, that featured a video game in which the object was to transform Loopy and Vas into alien-like insectoid space creatures. The enhanced CD was again cited for its progressive-minded musical stylings and groundbreaking technological advances. This lead the band to tour the U.S. extensively with Tommy Victor's Prong, giving them even broader exposure nationally. During that year, Hanzel und Gretyl's song &quot;9D Galactik Center&quot; appeared in New Line Cinema's &quot;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&quot; and was also played at the 1997 MTV Music Awards. Furthermore, the song &quot;Robot Logik&quot; from the same album was used in radio commercials for the Howard Stern Show.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Hanzel und Gretyl toured the U.S. in direct support of Germany's venerable Rammstein on the band's first ever headlining tour of the states after meeting and playing with the band at a CMJ Music Marathon show in New York City. In 1999 HuG completed a full-length CD entitled Oz Faktor that is currently unreleased by Energy Records. The CD depicts a displaced Hanzel und Gretyl lost in a quasi-&quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; type setting. As of yet, HuG's entire 90s discography remains out of print and a rare find item in the industrial realm. Mint condition, factory sealed copies have been known to sell for upwards of one hundred dollars.\n\n\nAfter a long hiatus due to a legal dispute with their former label which had dissolved, the band signed to Metropolis Records in 2002 and immediately began recording for their long anticipated third album, Uber Alles. Described by Kaizer Von Loopy as a &quot;futuristic Wagnerian rock opera&quot; and released in 2003, it marked a distinct stylistic change for the band favoring heavy guitar riffs and Germanic themes over the more genre expanding electro-metal style for which they had become known in the 90s. The CD was met with a fair amount of controversy over its parodic cross-referencing of both German and American stereotypes set against a surreal and spaced-out WW II backdrop but nevertheless attained a four out of five star review in Kerrang! magazine and equally high praise from New York City's prestigious The Village Voice. Following the release of the album, the band toured the U.S. as a headliner on their aptly named &quot;Fukken Uber Tour&quot; and later in direct support of The Genitorturers in the states and Canada after which they returned to the studio to record a new album.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2004, the band released their fourth album, Scheissmessiah. The album was immediately hailed as required listening for fans of industrial metal along side Nine Inch Nails, KMFDM and Ministry by Revolver Magazine. Served up devilishly as a &quot;Handel's Messiah from hell&quot;, HuG continued to grow harder and heavier touring the states in support of My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and in direct support of Al Jourgensen's Ministry for a three-month stint on their &quot;Evil Doer Tour&quot; throughout the U.S. and Canada. In 2005, Hanzel und Gretyl headlined North America's largest goth festival, &quot;Gothicfest 2005&quot;, in Illinois and were featured yet again in Revolver Magazine's &quot;bands to watch&quot;. In 2006, the band toured across America and Canada as a headliner with label mates Bella Morte in direct support upon the release of the four-song EP &quot;Oktotenfest 2006&quot;. With song titles like &quot;Fukken Uber Death Party&quot; and later &quot;Bavarian Bierhaus Blood&quot;, HuG's home-brewed putsch soon led to a full-scale U.K. tour in direct support of Cradle of Filth in 2007. Shortly thereafter, they began work on their fifth full-length album, 2012: Zwanzig ZwÃƒÂ¶lf, released in February 2008. Drawing more and more from death metal and black metal sentiments, 2012 is HuG's heaviest offering thus far. The album's central motif follows the Mayan theory that the world will end in 2012, and the band posits the subsequent extinction of the human race following one last rock concert to be performed by HuG after which a pyramid will unearth itself and carry the band members and all participants safely into outer space. Upon the release of 2012, the band's growing cross-over appeal with both metalheads and rivetheads alike soon led to HuG's first-ever headlining shows overseas beginning in Moscow, Russia in September 2008.\n\n\nIn January of 2009, Hanzel und Gretyl kicked off their extensive headlining &quot;World Fukken Tour&quot; including shows throughout the U.S., Europe, U.K., Scandinavia, Russia, Ukraine, New Zealand and Australia ending with a final show in New York City on December 19, 2009.\n\n\nHanzel Und Gretyl are back with their seventh studio album Black Forest Metal. Darker, heavier, and more metal than ever, this marks a new era for the band.\n\n\n\nLine-up:\nKaizer Von Loopy - Vocals, Guitar, programming\nVas Kallas - Vocals, Bass\n\n\n\nDiscography:\n1994  Kindermusik\n1995  Ausgeflippt\n1997  Transmissions From Uranus\n1999  Oz Faktor\n2003  ÃƒÅ“ber Alles\n2004  Scheissmessiah\n2006  OktÃƒÂ¶tenfest\n2008  2012: Zwanzig ZwÃƒÂ¶lf\n2012  Born To Be Heiled\n\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
