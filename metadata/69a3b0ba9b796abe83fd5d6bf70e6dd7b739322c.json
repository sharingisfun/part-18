In this course, Paul F. Aubin shows how to use phasing and design options to organize multipart, multifaceted projects in Revit. The course also covers adding and assigning phases to views, scheduling phases and designating future work, working with design option sets, and presenting complex designs to clients.\nTopics include:\nWhat is phasing?\nPhasing properties for objects\nUsing phase filters and graphic overrides\nPhasing rooms\nLooking at topography and phasing\nSetting up design options\nStrategizing design options\nWorking with phasing and design options together","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69a3b0ba9b796abe83fd5d6bf70e6dd7b739322c","amp;dn":"Phasing+and+Design+Options+in+Revit+-+Lynda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69a3b0ba9b796abe83fd5d6bf70e6dd7b739322c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,163,176,186,155,121,106,190,131,253,93,107,247,14,109,215,183,57,50,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
