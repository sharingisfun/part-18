Chapters by scholars of Chinese history and art and by artists whose careers were shaped by the Cultural Revolution offer new insights into works that have transcended their times.\r\n\r\nRichard King is the director of the Centre for Asia-Pacific Initiatives and an associate professor of Chinese studies at the University of Victoria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42216d56dfb76fb768dc02e6f217428a0e22573d","amp;dn":"Art+in+turmoil+-+The+Chinese+Cultural+Revolution%2C+1966-76","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42216d56dfb76fb768dc02e6f217428a0e22573d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,33,109,86,223,183,111,183,104,220,2,230,242,23,66,138,14,34,87,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
