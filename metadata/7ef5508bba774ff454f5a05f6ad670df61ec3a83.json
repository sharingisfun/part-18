One of the album's tracks, &quot;Back to the Motor League&quot;, indirectly refers to two songs by the Dead Kennedys, &quot;Triumph of the Swill&quot; and &quot;Chickenshit Conformist&quot;, as well the year of their release on the 1986 album Bedtime for Democracy. The &quot;Back to the Motor League&quot; lyrics state: &quot;fifteen years later it still reeks of swill and chickenshit conformists&quot;. Both the Dead Kennedys songs and the Propagandhi track concern the co-opting of punk ideology by the corporate record industry. &quot;Purina Hall of Fame&quot; is a reference to the NestlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© owned pet food company, The Ralston Purina Company. The title is cynical take on the Purina Animal Hall of Fame, a site that celebrates animals who have saved human lives. The lyrics of &quot;Purina Hall of Fame&quot; obliquely outline Propagandhi's concerns about animal cruelty.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n\n.: TracKList :.\n\n1. Mate Ka Moris Ukun Rasik An\n2.
