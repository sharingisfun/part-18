In a very good sense they are the first band ever that reminds me of the swedish phenomenon called Hedningarna and their greatest release &quot;TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤&quot; which stands for me as _the_ 90's one and only album milestone leaving even Nirvana far behind. Like Zywiolak are also using mainly female vocals plus sometimes male. This makes a very nice blend. The difference is that Zywiolak are much more melting folk with Rock and are using - if I hear right - an electronic Bass, but alike this is music both fans of Folk and Rock will love because it does only contain the best of both worlds. This is no half-hearted chrossover, this is great music!!!\n\nyou could buy it in the greater part of Polish music shops or here: www.karrot.pl/ang/zywiolak\n\n\nadd demonoid tracker to get more sources !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c170289aa77142be45f00d05cf6aa0acef0a02df","amp;dn":"%C3%85%C2%BBywio%C3%85%E2%80%9Aak+-+Nowa+Ex-Tradycja+PL+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c170289aa77142be45f00d05cf6aa0acef0a02df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,112,40,154,167,113,66,190,69,240,13,5,207,106,160,172,239,10,2,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
