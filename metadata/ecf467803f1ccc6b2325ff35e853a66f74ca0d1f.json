Harkening back to the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Great Giana Sisters, Project Giana pulls you into a phantasmagorical adventure of contrasting themes underscored with music by Chris HÃƒÂ¼lsbeck and Machinae Supremacy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ classic Giana tunes flow into metal riffs and back again as you switch between dream and nightmare.\nGianaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dual nature is a reflection of the game world. You can warp her dreams at the press of a button, causing Giana herself to shift accordingly. Both the world and Giana will behave differently depending on whether you are in the dream or nightmare, allowing you to master each level with transformative tricks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf467803f1ccc6b2325ff35e853a66f74ca0d1f","amp;dn":"PSN-%5BGiana+Sisters%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf467803f1ccc6b2325ff35e853a66f74ca0d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,244,103,128,63,28,204,107,35,37,255,53,232,83,166,111,116,202,13,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
