The eight band members, all from the Leahy family of eleven siblings, are from Lakefield, Ontario and have been actively touring Canada and internationally since the early 1980s when they were known as The Leahy Family.\n\nThe line-up of the group varies depending upon the availability of its members who come and go due to marriage, raising children, and other commitments. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the band recorded a number of privately-released LPs and cassettes (most of which used the same title, The Leahy Family) which were sold at their concerts and they were frequent guests at the Big Valley Jamboree concerts in Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nIn 1997 the band resumed recording with their &quot;relaunch&quot; album, Leahy which also introduced the group's new branding. Leahy was an instrumental album, but the band also includes vocal performances in their live performances and subsequent albums have included both vocals and instrumentals.\n\nDespite their already-established history, they were awarded two Juno awards in 1998, for Best New Group and Best Instrumental Artist. The following year, Leahy took a third Juno Award, for Best Country Group or Duo. Also in 1998, Leahy were added as the opening act for Canadian country singer Shania Twain's 1998 Come on Over Tour and were featured in two television specials from the tour, Live and The Specials, performing with Twain on the song &quot;Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)&quot;.\n\nThe group's members are both instrumentalists and dancers, with several members skilled in fiddle-playing (most notably the group's best-known member, Donnell Leahy). The female members of the band often perform step-dancing-style routines, and it is generally the female members of the group who sing.\n\nAll members of the band are siblings. Each member has a main role they play in the band; although most play more than one instrument and all step dance.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDonnell Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fiddle\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tErin Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Piano, Guitar, Fiddle, Mandolin, Vocals, Bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAngus Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fiddle\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tMaria Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Guitar, Banjo, Vocals\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSiobheann Donohue (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Leahy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bass, Vocals, Fiddle\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDoug Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fiddle\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAgnes Enright (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Leahy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Keyboards, Step dancer, Vocals\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tFrank Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Drums\n\nThese three sisters are not currently active in the band's touring schedule.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDenise Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Vocals (performed with group summer 2009)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tChrissie Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Keyboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJulie Leahy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Vocals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeahy 1997\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nB Minor\nCape Breton Medley\nMcBrides\nThe French\nThe Call to Dance\nAlabama\nDon Messer Medley\nCzardas\nColm Quigley\nThe Coulin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLakefield 2001\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nMission\nSeamus (Eamon CoyneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, Longford Collector)\nDown the Road\nDA (Stoney Lake &amp; Juniper Island)\nMoment\nLeviathan (Rapids, Leviathan)\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Let Me Down\nA Love Never Known\nG Minor Medley\nBorrowed Time\nStand Up\nThe Skater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn All Things 2004\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nChasing Rain\nLittle Ditty\nHigh Places\nWedding Day Jig\nCoyote Way\nClog Medley\nPointe Au Pic Medley\nRunaway\nI Want You to Know\nGzowski Medley\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0034a0207723529a19b37e2ae5937e2945ec2038","amp;dn":"Leahy+FLAC+Pack+-+3+albums+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0034a0207723529a19b37e2ae5937e2945ec2038","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,52,160,32,119,35,82,154,25,179,126,42,229,147,126,41,69,236,32,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
