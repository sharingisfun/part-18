Yogi Goswami \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 822 pages \r\nPublisher: CRC Press; 3 edition (February 20, 2015) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 978-1466563780 \r\n\r\n\r\nReflecting major developments in solar energy since the publication of the last edition, Principles of Solar Engineering, Third Edition follows the changes in energy policies that have led to the rapid growth of solar energy systems. This latest edition focuses on the fundamentals and the design of systems for various applications including building, heating and cooling, industrial process heat, electric power plants (including PV and CSP), and environmental systems.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s New in the Third Edition:\r\nThe third edition introduces new topics that include organic and dye sensitized solar cells in the photovoltaics chapter, advanced thermodynamic power cycles such as supercritical CO2 cycle and information on design software packages. The chapters on solar radiation and solar thermal collectors have been completely changed. Because of its increased importance, solar thermal power is covered in much more depth than in the previous edition.\r\n\r\nThe book contains increased coverage of high temperature thermal storage for CSP in the chapter for energy storage and transport. It changes many end-of-chapter problems, provides examples and problems for both northern and southern hemispheres and countries around the world, includes a solutions manual, and revises the retained material. A significant change in the new edition is the addition of economic analysis in the first chapter, which includes a number of solved examples, and allows the students to analyze the applications in the later chapters from an economic stand point","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b66d3e900d86a4ca02b36ac17f324e4216ea0d8","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Solar+Engineering%2C+3rd+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b66d3e900d86a4ca02b36ac17f324e4216ea0d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,102,211,233,0,216,106,76,160,43,54,172,23,243,36,228,33,110,160,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
