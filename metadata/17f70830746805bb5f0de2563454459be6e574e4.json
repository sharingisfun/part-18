What happens to a reader's experience when a poem invokes its author's popularity? Is there a meaningful connection between poetry and advertising, between the rhetoric of lyric and the rhetoric of hype? One of the first full-scale treatments of celebrity in nineteenth-century America, this book examines Walt Whitman's lifelong interest in fame and publicity.\nMaking use of notebooks, photographs, and archival sources, David Haven Blake provides a groundbreaking history of the rise of celebrity culture in the United States. He sees Leaves of Grass alongside the birth of commercial advertising and the nation's growing obsession with the lives of the famous and the renowned. As authors, lecturers, politicians, entertainers, and clergymen vied for popularity, Whitman developed a form of poetry that routinely promoted and, indeed, celebrated itself. Walt Whitman and the Culture of American Celebrity proposes a fundamentally new way of thinking about a seminal American poet and a major national icon.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nSmart without being dense, clever without being smarmy, this cultural history is an engaging, at times eye-opening read. Blake, an English professor at the College of New Jersey, views Walt Whitman and his work in relation to the rise of celebrity culture in the nineteenth century-the time of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Fanny Fern, and PT Barnum-paying particular attention to the emerging ideas of publicity, promotion, and society's changing conceptions of fame. But this isn't the story of Whitman's personal experience of fame; as Blake points out, that would make for a slim volume. Rather, he writes, &quot;Whitman's relation to American celebrity is a story about how the poet's thinking responded to the culture he observed developing around him.&quot; While the book is emphatically not a work of literary criticism, it nonetheless offers new and enjoyable ways of reading Whitman's work, particularly when viewed through the prism of advertising and self-promotion. For example, according to Blake, the most significant antebellum advertisements came from the patent medicine trade, and &quot;'Song of Myself' directly invokes the language of patent medicine advertising in describing the poet's astonishing impact.&quot; To the many critics and students who idolize Whitman, this may seem nothing short of blasphemous, but Blake insists this shouldn't be the case: &quot;Whitman's immersion in publicity does not rival or compromise the aspects of his work that readers have praised since the nineteenth century.&quot; Indeed, this enlightening study elevates all involved, especially the dubious legacy of that perennial beast, the American idol.\nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A detailed and impressive array of materials about the culture from which Whitman's work sprung.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Harold K.
