It was translated into English and German and published in Europe and the United States by Otaku Publishing Ltd. in 1999. The game is considered by many bishÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½jo game fans to be a classic.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nTrue Love's genre is considered to be a mixture of a dating sim and visual novel.\n\nThe player controls a college student looking for his true love. The goal of the game is to win the girls' hearts before the last summer of freedom is over. \n\nEvery day when the main character wakes up the player can plan the schedule for morning, afternoon, and evening. \n\nThe choices (such as pleasure, sports, study, etc.) determine what events will occur during the day (if any), and also raise the character's skills in the selected category. \n\nDifferent girls in the game (there are ten of them) have different interests, goals, and preferences. \n\nIf the character's skills in the category that the girl finds most important are high enough, he has a chance to score with that girl and become her boyfriend.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNo need for a DOS emulator, as this game runs in Windows. Personally tested on Windows Xp SP2, it should work on previous versions of windows. I don't know if it runs on Vista.\n\nEnjoy the game, if you have any doubts, write it here, and please, seed; as I saw some torrents of this game but there were no seeds or they were probably viruses (There's one torrent that uses more than 30MB)\n\nThis torrent was scanned with Norton Antivirus 2009, the 24/12/08 (Just minutes before uploading)\n\nEnjoy!\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\na_troncoso, 2008\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f73458544f0bbb9d9facd0b37039ae23c81a6cf7","amp;dn":"True+Love+GAME","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f73458544f0bbb9d9facd0b37039ae23c81a6cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,52,88,84,79,11,187,157,159,172,208,179,112,57,174,35,200,26,108,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
