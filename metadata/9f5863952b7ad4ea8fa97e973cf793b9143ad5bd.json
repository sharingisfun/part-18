We see how this enormous provocation was successfully executed and exploited as war propaganda.\r\nThis new, fifth edition reveals a whole new dimension of explosive facts for the first time: the enormous array of drills in which the US defense apparatus rehearsed every aspect of the 9/11 operation. Author Webster Tarpley presents the corpus of 9/11 research - such as the controlled demolition of the three WTC towers - from the perspective of a veteran intelligence expert and historian. The exploit is placed in the geopolitical context of oligarchy and imperialism - in the tradition of precedents such as the Gunpowder Plot, the USS Maine, the Strategy of Tension, and other historically decisive state-sponsored terror subterfuges","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f5863952b7ad4ea8fa97e973cf793b9143ad5bd","amp;dn":"Webster+Griffin+Tarpley+-+911+Synthetic+Terror+-+Made+in+USA%2C+Fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f5863952b7ad4ea8fa97e973cf793b9143ad5bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,88,99,149,43,122,212,234,143,169,126,151,60,247,147,185,20,58,213,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
