But such knowledge does not come without risk. When their laboratory is attacked, it becomes clear that someone will stop at nothing to keep this research from reaching the masses.\n\nAs more details come to light, Investigator Nick Dial realises that these scientists have been operating in the shadows for more than a century. What is more, the team was founded by none other than Albert Einstein himself. What had they learned? And why would someone want them dead?\n\nIt is a mystery that draws Payne and Jones in. On a collision course with the man behind the massacre, the duo must follow the history of scientific discovery in order to stop a villain determined to use modern advancements to create his own vision of the future - a future where he alone controls who may live and who will die...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1cb9ff51efa8550495926c4640ea31fcff207df","amp;dn":"The+Einstein+Pursuit+-+Chris+Kuzneski.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1cb9ff51efa8550495926c4640ea31fcff207df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,203,159,245,30,250,133,80,73,89,38,196,100,14,163,31,207,242,7,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
