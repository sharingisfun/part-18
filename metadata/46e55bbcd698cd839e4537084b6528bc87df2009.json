Bringing together a new band of musicians, Bailey Rae recorded the album mainly in Leeds and Manchester, England. Her voice, always an expressive and soulful instrument, resonates with a poignant and newfound depth on The Sea. Loss and grief are recurring themes yet a sense of beauty and wonder ultimately radiates from the album\\'s dark corners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e55bbcd698cd839e4537084b6528bc87df2009","amp;dn":"Corinne+Bailey+Rae+The+Sea+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e55bbcd698cd839e4537084b6528bc87df2009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,229,91,188,214,152,205,131,158,69,55,8,75,101,40,188,135,223,32,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
