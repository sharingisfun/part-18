And those operations need alarm systems to alert engineers and managers the moment anything goes wrong or needs attention. This book, by one of the world's leading experts on industrial alarm systems, will provide A to Z coverage of designing, implementing, and maintaining an effective alarm network. It will show the reader how to understand alarm systems, the rationale for their design, and how to understand problems that can occur with such systems, along with the root causes and typical solutions. The book will offer guidance on: analyzing and managing alarm performance; how to correctly identify 'abnormal situations'; Global Standards for Alarm management, including OSHA (USA), ISA18, HSE (UK) and NAMUR (Germany); Alarm System metrics and benchmarking; setting up Alarm System Permissions protocols; and, planning and managing a new Alarm System Project. No industrial engineer or technical manager should be without this book at the ready","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6870b4023fe394b0356dcd3515df655d2af6f16d","amp;dn":"Alarm+Management+for+Process+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6870b4023fe394b0356dcd3515df655d2af6f16d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,112,180,2,63,227,148,176,53,109,205,53,21,223,101,93,42,246,241,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
