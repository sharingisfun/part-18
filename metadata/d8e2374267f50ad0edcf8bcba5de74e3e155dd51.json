On his quartet set with pianist John Taylor, bassist Chris Laurence and drummer John Marshall, Surman mostly sticks to soprano although there are some short spots for his baritone and bass clarinet. Surman always sounds relaxed, even on the more heated originals. It's an interesting set of generally introverted music. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nTracklist\n1 Canticle With Response 6:09 \n2 A Distant Spring7:42 \n3 Tess 6:39 \n4 Promising Horizons 5:30 \n5 Across the Bridge 7:52 \n6 Moonshine Dancer 6:42 \n7 Running Sands  9:07 \n8 Hidden Orchid / Synapsis / Paratactic Paths 14:43\n\nRecorded at Rainbow Studio, Oslo, Norway in December 1993.\n\nPersonnel: John Surman (soprano &amp; baritone saxophone, alto &amp; bass clarinet); John Taylor (piano); Chris Laurence (bass); John Marshall (drums).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8e2374267f50ad0edcf8bcba5de74e3e155dd51","amp;dn":"John+Surman+Quartet+Stranger+Than+Fiction%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8e2374267f50ad0edcf8bcba5de74e3e155dd51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,226,55,66,103,245,10,208,237,207,139,203,165,222,116,227,225,85,221,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
