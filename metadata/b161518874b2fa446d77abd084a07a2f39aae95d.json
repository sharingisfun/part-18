(late 50s or early 60s at a guess) The readers are first-rate and the audio OK. Weirdly effective in evoking the spectral and fantastic qualities of the poem.\n\nThe second is a production by the ABC dating back to November, 2002.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b161518874b2fa446d77abd084a07a2f39aae95d","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+Of+Coleridge+-+5+-+Rime+of+the+Ancient+Mariner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b161518874b2fa446d77abd084a07a2f39aae95d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,97,81,136,116,178,250,68,109,119,171,208,132,160,122,47,57,170,233,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
