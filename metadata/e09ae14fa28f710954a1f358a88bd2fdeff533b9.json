Watching this staggeringly gorgeous new 35mm print, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll most likely find yourself echoing the sentiments of Marianne Renoir (Karina), on the lam with Ferdinand (Belmondo) on the CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´te dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Azur: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI feel alive, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all that matters.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSandwiched between GodardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s black-and-white Alphaville (1964) and Masculine-Feminine (1966), Pierrot le Fou pulsates, much like Two or Three Things I Know About HerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ (1967), with the primary hues of FranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tricolor. Red (of the dress MarianneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½note that nameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½wears and the blood of her victims) and blue (of the Mediterranean and the face paint Ferdinand applies before blowing himself up) become characters in their own right.\n\nLike the titular nickname Marianne gives Ferdinand, GodardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s widescreen dazzler is crazyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with references to both culture (VelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zquez, Johnny Guitar and Balzac are mentioned in the first five minutes) and atrocities (the Algerian and Vietnam Wars). Pierrot le Fou is also crazy in love with its two leads. But how crazy is this: YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-yÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© star Sylvie Vartan was originally offered KarinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s role, and JLG approached Richard Burton before Belmondo. Karina and Godard were nearing the end of their personal (and professional) relationship by the time Pierrot was released; Belmondo, the star of Breathless, never worked with the director again. All of which underscores the definition of cinema Sam Fuller, in a cameo, proffers: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn a word: emotion.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e09ae14fa28f710954a1f358a88bd2fdeff533b9","amp;dn":"French+Film+Collection%28Film+6%29+PIERROT+LE+FOU+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e09ae14fa28f710954a1f358a88bd2fdeff533b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,154,225,79,162,143,113,9,84,161,243,88,168,139,210,253,239,245,51,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
