There is a bug which means you will only connect to one seeder/peer at a time instead of several.\n\nThis is causing problems for our seeding (and for other uploaders too I would assume) as each torrent takes alot longer to get a life on its own, and thus we have to wait longer betweeen uploads.\n\nSo please download this or any of the other Utorrent 3.2.3 builds until V3.3 is fixed.\n\nThanks\n\nShallow02 and Merzedes\n\nCheers :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f6a6facd23de4493e64030f034c61e40effeebc","amp;dn":"Software----Utorrent+3.2.3%2C+use+until+v3.3+bugs+are+fixed+please","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f6a6facd23de4493e64030f034c61e40effeebc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,106,111,172,210,61,228,73,62,100,3,15,3,76,97,228,14,255,238,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
