Though the Great War has left his nerves frayed with shellshock, Wimsey continues to be LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest sleuthÃ¢â‚¬â€and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to encounter his oddest case yet. A strange corpse has appeared in a suburban architectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bathroom, stark naked save for an incongruous pince-nez. When Wimsey arrives on the scene, he is confronted with a once-in-a-lifetime puzzle. The police suspect that the bathtubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s owner is the murderer, but WimseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation quickly reveals that the case is much stranger than anyone could have predicted.\n\nIn Clouds of Witness, after three months in Corsica, Lord Peter Wimsey has begun to forget that the gray, dangerous moors of England ever existed. But traveling through Paris, he receives a shock that jolts him back to reality: His brother Gerald has been arrested for murder. The trouble began at the family estate in Yorkshire, where Gerald was hunting with the man soon to be his brother-in-law, Captain Denis Cathcart. When Cathcart is found dead, Gerald is presumed to be the only one who could have fired the fatal shot. The clock is ticking, and only EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier sleuth can get to the bottom of this murky mystery. \n\nAnd in Unnatural Death, three operations failed to rid the aging Agatha Dawson of her cancer, but she refused to give in. As her body began to weaken, she accused lawyers, nurses, and doctors of trying to kill her and snatch her fortune. The town physician, an expert in cancer, gives her six months to live. Three days later, she is dead. Though the autopsy reveals nothing surprising, the doctor suspects that AgathaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s niece had some hand in the old womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. When Lord Peter Wimsey, the dashing gentleman detective, looks into the matter, he finds that death stalks all those who might testify. How can he continue his investigation when every question marks another innocent for murder?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c793a4eecdcdaca36647b629d8c036ef5275bdd9","amp;dn":"The+Lord+Peter+Wimsey+Mysteries+-+Volumes+1-3+-+Dorothy+L.+Sayer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c793a4eecdcdaca36647b629d8c036ef5275bdd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,147,164,238,205,205,172,163,102,71,182,41,216,192,54,239,82,117,189,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
