If they won't play in, say, Winamp, which is what I use, you can download a plugin that definitely will handle them here: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=157572.\n\nThese are Boston's first two albums, Boston and Don't Look Back, remastered in 2006 by Boston's own Tom Schulz. No, I can't tell you how they compare to the Boston SACD from 2004 or PBTHAL's rip of the MFSL vinyl, or very early Japanese CDs, for that matter. What I can tell you is that they sound superb to my ears. Smooth and well-balanced. A bit of compression may bother some, but to me they sound great. And not a bit of harshness: you can crank them right up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cfb4390bf73390f9c3971f68b737367c4226eb8","amp;dn":"Boston+-+Boston+%26+Don%5C%27t+Look+Back+%282006+remasters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cfb4390bf73390f9c3971f68b737367c4226eb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,251,67,144,191,115,57,15,156,57,113,246,139,115,115,103,196,34,110,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
