Love it or hate it, it's impossible to deny the immense energy of Ayler's music.\n\nThese files were not ripped by me but (ostensibly) by the folks at holyfuckingshit40000 dot bl0gsp0t dot comic-minus-the-ic who have distributed them through M3g@Upl0@d. They were originally encoded with FLAC 1.1.4, though I've recompressed them (without any loss of quality, of course) with the slightly more efficient FLAC 1.2.1. While I can't 100% vouch for the accuracy of the rip, the files sound excellent and the scarcity of the material in question compels me to upload it regardless.\n\nQ: Why are you uploading someone else's rip when their copy is still available for download?\nA: (1) As far as I know, this album is not readily available in FLAC on TPB or other torrent networks. (2) It deserves, imho, as wide an audience as possible. (3) I don't trust M3g@Upl0@d to continue to make it available; in the hands of hundreds (wishful thinking, I know) of seeders, it will be less likely to disappear from the internet than is the single copy on M3g@Upl0@d.\n\nPlease seed for as long as you can. Let's keep these hard-to-find rips alive and available to anyone interested.\n\n* * * * * * * *\ntracklist:\nAlbert_Ayler_-_SU01_Ghosts:_First_Variation.flac\nAlbert_Ayler_-_SU02_The_Wizard.flac\nAlbert_Ayler_-_SU03_Spirits.flac\nAlbert_Ayler_-_SU04_Ghosts:_Second_Variation.flac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925b658acde3d6e59b13fec816b5ac0ba550fdcd","amp;dn":"Albert+Ayler+Trio+-+Spiritual+Unity+%281964%29+%5BFLAC%5D%5Bchabosun%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925b658acde3d6e59b13fec816b5ac0ba550fdcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,91,101,138,205,227,214,229,155,19,254,200,22,181,172,11,165,80,253,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
