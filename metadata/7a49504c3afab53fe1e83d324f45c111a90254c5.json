With each step, audiences will discover that just beneath the surface of our everyday experience lies a world weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d hardly recognizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a startling world far stranger and more wondrous than anyone expected.\n\nBrian Greene is going to let you in on a secret: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve all been deceived. Our perceptions of time and space have led us astray. Much of what we thought we knew about our universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that the past has already happened and the future is yet to be, that space is just an empty void, that our universe is the only universe that existsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just might be wrong.\n\nInterweaving provocative theories, experiments, and stories with crystal-clear explanations and imaginative metaphors like those that defined the groundbreaking and highly acclaimed series \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Elegant Universe,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; aims to be the most compelling, visual, and comprehensive picture of modern physics ever seen on television.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a49504c3afab53fe1e83d324f45c111a90254c5","amp;dn":"The+Fabric+Of+The+Cosmos+%28All+Series%29+1080i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a49504c3afab53fe1e83d324f45c111a90254c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,73,80,76,58,250,181,63,225,232,61,50,79,69,193,17,169,2,84,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
