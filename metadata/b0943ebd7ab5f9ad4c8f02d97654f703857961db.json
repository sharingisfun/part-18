People being what they are, they think he's a terrifying delinquent, and there are plenty of chance misunderstandings (coupled with Kitano's convenient inability to understand what's happening around him) that propel him into the position of &quot;school guardian&quot;, a.k.a. head thug on campus.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0943ebd7ab5f9ad4c8f02d97654f703857961db","amp;dn":"%5BManga%5D+Angel+Densetsu+%5Bcomplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0943ebd7ab5f9ad4c8f02d97654f703857961db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,148,62,189,122,181,249,173,76,143,2,217,118,84,247,3,133,121,97,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
