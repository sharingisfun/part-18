You can enter a room and find the light switch off. Before you know it, tons of horrible monsters or zombies are on the attack! The game also ends each of its three episodes with climatic battles.\n\n\n\n\nDuke Nukem 3D (Atomic Edition 1.5) (1996)\n\nThis game, set sometime in the early 21st century, begins in a ravaged LA, which was overtaken by aliens while you were abducted during Duke Nukem II. Duke, upon returning to Earth, finds himself with another mess to clean up, and another alien race that needs exterminating. Duke is a can-do hero who realizes that sometimes innocent people have to die in order to save Earth, so accuracy of gun fire is not a real concern to him.\n\n\n\n\nPowerslave (Exhumed) (1996)\n\nYou play a covert operations specialist who's been ferried into the Egyptian city of Karnak to find out who or what has sealed off the town from the rest of the world. The only information you have is from a villager who somehow managed to escape: before he died, he said someone had invaded the city, stolen the mummy of the Pharoah Ramses, and was attempting to bring him back to life.\n\n\n\n\nBlood (1997)\n\nYou are Caleb, virtuous gun slinger. Coaxed into a cult worshiping Tchernobog by a beautiful woman, their idol had a change of heart and killed all his followers including his love. You are resurrected in the 1940ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s by cult members and seek revenge on Tchernobog who also has been reawakened. Standing in your path are throngs of zombies, gargoyles, minions, spiders and simple key collecting puzzles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f970e62f2419d0fc10966d2e540d19825ba6c733","amp;dn":"DOS+emulator+%2B+4+classic+games+%28Blood%2C+PowerSlave%2C+Duke+Nukem+3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f970e62f2419d0fc10966d2e540d19825ba6c733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,112,230,47,36,25,208,252,16,150,109,46,84,13,25,130,91,166,199,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
