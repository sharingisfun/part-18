That means Office will keep working after the 30-day\n&quot;grace period&quot;, and it will not show the &quot;Activation Wizard&quot; when an\nOffice application such as Word is ran. It will also make Office\napplications show that they're activated when one goes to the Help\noption in the File menu.\n\nImportant:\n\n It is recommended that you disable Microsoft Update. You can use the\n Windows Control Panel to configure Windows Update, where you can\n disable Microsoft Update. If the option for Microsoft Update isn't\n shown in the Windows Update settings, you should also be safe.\n\n Why is this recommended? It's recommended because after having used\n the activation patch, updates are the only way for Microsoft to undo\n the activation patch. Even though at the time of writing (May\n 7th, 2012) there are no updates that will undo the activation patch,\n it is nevertheless something to keep in mind.\n\n Note that, as opposed to Microsoft Update, you can leave Windows\n Update enabled.\n\nRemarks:\n\n The activation patch works regardless of the language of Office 2010.\n\n The activation patch works regardless of whether the\n &quot;Attempt to automatically activate my product online.&quot; option was\n enabled during the installation of Office.\n\n The activation patch was tested (and works) with the following\n versions of Office:\n - Office 2010 Standard (without Service Pack 1) 32-bit\n - Office 2010 Standard (without Service Pack 1) 64-bit\n - Office 2010 Professional Plus (without Service Pack 1) 32-bit\n - Office 2010 Professional Plus (without Service Pack 1) 64-bit\n - Office 2010 Standard with Service Pack 1 32-bit\n - Office 2010 Standard with Service Pack 1 64-bit\n - Office 2010 Professional Plus with Service Pack 1 32-bit\n - Office 2010 Professional Plus with Service Pack 1 64-bit\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:271bc316e787d80ab8db8b15e4f9f2475109cf84","amp;dn":"Office+2010+activation+patch+%5Bv2.0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"271bc316e787d80ab8db8b15e4f9f2475109cf84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,27,195,22,231,135,216,10,184,219,139,21,228,249,242,71,81,9,207,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
