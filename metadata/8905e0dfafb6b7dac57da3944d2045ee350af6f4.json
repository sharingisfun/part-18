As such, he must prevent a war, while facing a personal dilemma. Lynne Warner (Sharon Gless) is the United States Secretary of Defense, Nicholas Brocklehurst (Ben Daniels) is the British Counsellor External Affairs, and James Sinclair (Alex Jennings) is the former British ambassador to the fictional former Soviet republic of Tyrgyzstan. This character resembles the &quot;diplomatic untouchable&quot; Craig Murray, the drinking, womanizing[citation needed] British ambassador who became embroiled in revealing human rights abuses in Uzbekistan.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8905e0dfafb6b7dac57da3944d2045ee350af6f4","amp;dn":"%5BBBC%5D+The+state+within+%282006%29+%2F+complete+6+part+miniseries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8905e0dfafb6b7dac57da3944d2045ee350af6f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,5,224,223,175,182,183,218,197,125,163,148,77,32,69,238,53,10,246,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
