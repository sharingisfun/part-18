Subramanian (OUP, 2010).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-19-806110-6\r\n\r\nBeginning with an introduction to the basic concepts of stresses in simple and composite elements, strains, and deformation of solids, the book moves through discussions on loads and stresses on the beam, which is a common structural element, torsion, and beam deflection. It then discusses columns and analysis of stresses in two dimensions. the boko also deals with strain energy concepts and their applications. \r\n\r\nThe book provides an exhaustive coverage of important topics such as temperature stresses. elastic constants, bending moments, shear forces, theory of simple bending, analysis and design of shafts, stepped, indeterminate and compound shafts, close- and open-coiled helical springs, Euler equations and Rankine formula for columns, and Mohr's circle. \r\n\r\nTO reinforce the theoretical concepts, the text is supplemented by a large number of worked-out examples with step-by-step solution procedures as well as a large number of review questions and exercise problems. The text is also well supported by a large number of detailed illustrations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6591cee7262b0f5be5fc652fc218c04d347e15a7","amp;dn":"Strength+of+Materials+2nd+ed+-+R.+Subramanian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6591cee7262b0f5be5fc652fc218c04d347e15a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,145,206,231,38,43,15,91,229,252,101,47,194,24,192,77,52,126,21,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
