He wakes up with a terrible hangover, a hazy memory and an extra BlackBerry in the pocket of his wine-stained suit. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing better than his friend, political staffer Ed Sawatski, who is floating face down in the icy Rideau Canal.\n\nThe same morning, Prime Minister Bruce Stevens tells his wife he has decided to retire from politics, which sets off a ruthless, no-holds-barred power struggle in the backrooms and bedrooms of Ottawa.\n\nMacdonald doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know it, but he has a great story on his hands, if he can stay alive long enough to tell it.\n\nGenre: Fiction / Mystery, Political Thriller | Cultural / Canada","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:035f548aaf203388cf7f93e95b79b175a4ee03d6","amp;dn":"Deadline+by+Stephen+Maher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"035f548aaf203388cf7f93e95b79b175a4ee03d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,95,84,138,175,32,51,136,207,127,147,233,91,121,177,117,164,238,3,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
