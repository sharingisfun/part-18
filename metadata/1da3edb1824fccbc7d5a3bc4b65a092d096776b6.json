They were signed to Warner Bros. Records.\n\nThe band's name comes from a term coined by detective novelist Dashiell Hammett. The term apparently describes the addled, fearful mindset people are in after a prolonged immersion in violent situations. The term was coined in the novel Red Harvest, which is also the title of Bloodsimple's second album.\nEarly history (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004)\n\nBloodsimple formed in 2002, originally under the name Fix 8, and featured former Vision of Disorder members vocalist Tim Williams and guitarist Mike Kennedy, along with ex-Piece Dogs, Skrew, and Medication bassist Kyle Sanders (brother of Troy Sanders, bassist of heavy metal band Mastodon), and former Downset, and Deadbolt drummer Chris Hamilton.\n\nIn early May 2004, the band opened New York shows for Superjoint Ritual. Then in June, the band signed to Warner Bros. Records, through Bullygoat Records, an imprint founded by Chad Gray, vocalist for Mudvayne and Hellyeah. Their debut album, entitled A Cruel World, was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with producer Garth Richardson. Then, in late February 2005, they began the &quot;Alliance of Defiance&quot; U.S. tour alongside Otep, American Head Charge and Candiria.\nRed Harvest (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008)\n\nBloodsimple were reported to begin a tour with Diecast and Sevendust on February 8, 2007 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. However, on December 20, it was that report was refuted by Bloodsimple saying; &quot;We're putting the finishing touches on the record this week and will mix it first thing in January 2007, then wait on official release date and touring plans which will hopefully be in March.&quot;\n\n\n\nBloodsimple then spent the latter part of May and most of June touring in Europe, performing at festivals and clubs. Some of the performances that month include; performimg on the &quot;Dimebag Darrell Stage&quot; at the Download Festival in Donington Park, Leicestershire., performing at the Fields of Rock festival in Biddinghuizen, the Netherlands on June 16, performing at the Bilbao DDK Live Festival 2007, in Bilbao, Euskal Herria, Spain on June 21, performing at the Hellfest in Clisson, France on June 22, and performing between June 23Ã¢â‚¬â€œ24 in Dessel, Belgium at the Metal Dome as part of the Graspop Metal Metting. Then on July 29, Bloodsimple was added to the Family Values Tour, and would be performing on the second-stage. However, on September 1, the band issued a statement announcing that they were forced to cancel their appearances on the final three days of the Family Values tour, due to vocalist Tim Williams having a tooth pulled.\n\nOn October 30, the same day as their new album's release, the band began touring in support of Hellyeah on the &quot;Balls Volume Strength&quot; tour. That same day, the band's long delayed second album, Red Harvest was released in the U.S. through Bullygoat/Reprise Records. It was produced by Machine, who had produced records for many successful acts such as Eighteen Visions and Lamb of God. In its first week of release, the album sold 2,400 copies. On November 20, Bloodsimple was scheduled to perform in Amarillo, Texas along with Hellyeah and Otep, however, on the day of the concert, it was announced that that nights concert had been cancelled.\n\nBloodsimple then opened for Avenged Sevenfold from January 17 through February 1.Then, that same month, the music video for the band's next single &quot;Out to Get You&quot; began streaming on the official website for Metal Hammer. The video features footage from the movie Night of the Living Dead by George A. Romero. In April, the band joined Korn, Biohazard, and Chimaira on a six show tour of Australia and New Zealand. Then on April 9, it was announced that they had been nominated for an award at the 2008 &quot;Metal Hammer Golden Gods&quot; awards. They were nominated, along with Still Remains, Apocalyptica, DevilDriver, and Every Time I Die, for &quot;Breakthrough Artist.&quot; Bloodsimple were then schdeuled to appear on WSOU's 60th Anniversary show on April 18, however, just six days prior to the show, it was announced that they had been replaced by Anaka. On April 16, it was announced that Bloodsimple was scheduled to perform at Rockfest, in Kansas City, Missouri. However on May 30 bassist Kyle Sanders issued a statement stating:\n\n    Due to circumstances out of our control, Bloodsimple is NOT on Rockfest in Kansas City June 7th, and we are not on tour with Sevendust. We apologize to all fans who planned on hanging out with us and we are deeply sorry to all in the Sevendust camp, but we were forced to drop off the tour due to a loss in the band's family. We're all extremely disheartened about this and hope to be back in the saddle soon.\n   \n\nIn late 2008, their song &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; was featured on the video game WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2009. In October 2008, Vision of Disorder reformed to record a new album.\n\nIn March 2010 bassist Kyle Sanders released a statement concerning his new band Monstro, the beginning of which indicates that bloodsimple is no longer an active band:\n\n    Not going into the whole song and dance about the depressing end of bloodsimple. It drains my soul. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been in a cave since April 2008 but am jumping on this demon pig again.\n    \n\nNo statement has been released by Kennedy or Williams who are currently working on the new Vision of Disorder album.\nMembers\n\n    Tim Williams - Vocals (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008) in Vision of Disorder now\n    Mike Kennedy - Guitar (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008) in Vision of Disorder now\n    Nick Rowe - Guitar (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008)\n    Kyle Sanders - Bass (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008) ex-Piece Dogs, Skrew, and Medication, in HELLYEAH now.\n\nFormer members\n\n    Chris Hamilton - Drums (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006) ex-Downset, and Deadbolt with givethemrope As of 2012\n\nTouring members\n\n    Brendon Cohen - Drums (Vision of Disorder, Karnov) (2006)\n    Will Hunt - Drums (Dark New Day) (2007)\n    Mike Froedge - Drums (doubleDrive) (2007)\n    Bevan Davies - Drums (Jerry Cantrell, Danzig) (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008)\nThats all youn get when I try to post to much writing it acts weird and sometimes wont allow it so thats enough now you get to seed this and I can find more shit for ya .......but ya gotta.......seed.....s..e...e....d!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da3edb1824fccbc7d5a3bc4b65a092d096776b6","amp;dn":"Bloodsimple+-+Red+Harvest++mp3++320k+++ak2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da3edb1824fccbc7d5a3bc4b65a092d096776b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,163,237,177,130,79,204,188,125,90,59,196,182,90,9,45,9,103,118,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
