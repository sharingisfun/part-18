Their style draws from disco, glam rock, pop and the club scene of New York City.\n\nThe group was named after a sex position between two women (tribadism). While experiencing only limited mainstream success in the United States, the band has been hugely successful in Europe, Canada, Australia, and particularly in the UK, where they have achieved a number of chart hits, as well as their debut album becoming the best-selling album of 2004 in that country. Their single &quot;I Don't Feel Like Dancin'&quot; was the fourth best-selling single in the UK in 2006 and stayed in the UK top 40 for 27 weeks.\n\nScissor Sisters is the debut studio album by American 5-piece band Scissor Sisters, first released in 2004 (see 2004 in music). It was released by Polydor in the UK. It reached number 1 on the UK and Irish album charts, and was the best-selling album in the UK for the year 2004. Since its release it has gone 7x Platinum in the UK selling over 2,500,000 copies in the UK alone[1]. In Ireland it has been certified a close 5x Platinum. The album was not as successful in their native USA, peaking at #102 on the Billboard 200. The album has sold 3,300,000 copies worldwide,[2] and is listed as one of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die in the book of the same name, edited by Robert Dimery.
