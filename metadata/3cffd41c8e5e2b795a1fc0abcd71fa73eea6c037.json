Standing on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, it welcomes visitors, immigrants, and returning Americans traveling by ship.[5] The copper-clad statue, dedicated on October 28, 1886, commemorates the centennial of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence and is a gesture of friendship from France to the United States.[6] FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ric Auguste Bartholdi sculpted the statue[7] and obtained a U.S. patent for its structure.[8] Maurice Koechlin - chief engineer of Gustave Eiffel&amp;#039;s engineering company and designer of the Eiffel Tower - engineered the internal structure. EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne Viollet-le-Duc was responsible for the choice of copper in the statue&amp;#039;s construction and adoption of the repoussÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© technique, where a malleable metal is hammered on the reverse side.[9]\n\nThe statue is of a robed woman holding a torch, and is made of a sheeting of pure copper, hung on a framework of steel (originally puddled iron) with the exception of the flame of the torch, which is coated in gold leaf (originally made of copper and later altered to hold glass panes.) It stands atop a rectangular stonework pedestal with a foundation in the shape of an irregular eleven-pointed star. The statue is 151 ft (46 m) tall, but with the pedestal and foundation, it is 305 ft (93 m) tall.\n\nWorldwide, the Statue of Liberty is one of the most recognizable icons of the United States[10] and was, from 1886 until the jet age, often one of the first glimpses of the United States for millions of immigrants after ocean voyages from Europe. Visually, the Statue of Liberty appears to draw inspiration from il Sancarlone or the Colossus of Rhodes.\n\nThe statue is the central part of Statue of Liberty National Monument, administered by the National Park Service.\n\n\n\n\nThe general appearance of the statueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s head approximates the Roman Sun-god Apollo or the Greek Sun-god Helios as preserved on an ancient marble tablet (today in the Archaeological Museum of Corinth, Corinth, Greece) - Apollo was represented as a solar deity, dressed in a similar robe and having on its head a &quot;radiate crown&quot; with the seven spiked rays of the Helios-Apollo&amp;#039;s sun rays, like the Statue&amp;#039;s nimbus or halo. The ancient Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was a statue of Helios with a radiate crown. The Colossus is referred to in the 1883 sonnet The New Colossus by Emma Lazarus. Lazarus&amp;#039; poem was later engraved on a bronze plaque and mounted inside the Statue of Liberty in 1903.\n\nThe statue, also known affectionately as &quot;Lady Liberty&quot;, has become a symbol of freedom and democracy. She welcomed arriving immigrants, who could see the statue as they arrived in the United States. There is a version of the statue in France given by the United States in return.\n\nThe classical appearance (Roman stola, sandals, facial expression) derives from Libertas, ancient Rome&amp;#039;s goddess of freedom from slavery, oppression, and tyranny. Her raised right foot is on the move. This symbol of Liberty and Freedom is not standing still or at attention in the harbor, it is moving forward, as her left foot tramples broken shackles at her feet, in symbolism of the United States&amp;#039; wish to be free from oppression and tyranny.[11] The seven spikes on the crown epitomize the Seven Seas and seven continents.[12] Her torch signifies enlightenment. The tablet in her hand represents knowledge and shows the date of the United States Declaration of Independence, in roman numerals, July IV, MDCCLXXVI.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cffd41c8e5e2b795a1fc0abcd71fa73eea6c037","amp;dn":"Ken+Burns%5C%27+America+-+Statue+of+Liberty+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cffd41c8e5e2b795a1fc0abcd71fa73eea6c037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,255,212,28,142,94,43,121,90,31,192,171,205,113,250,115,238,166,192,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
