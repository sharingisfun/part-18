In 2005 they jettisoned away from the wreckage of the vastly underrated electro-pop four-piece Simian to become rave-up merchants of no little acclaim, and two years later released debut album Attack Decay Sustain Release. The pair are among the most in-demand producers, DJs and remixers operating in the UK today.\nSo itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no real surprise that this album is large, a towering monolith of wonky disco-textured dimensions and pure unadulterated indulgence, spitting out chunks of acidic boogie like diamond mirrorball shards. Unlike its predecessor, though, Temporary Pleasure features an array of high-profile guest vocalists, each adding a new dimension to the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound.\n\nSuper Furry AnimalsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gruff Rhys appears on luscious opener Cream Dream; Beth Ditto bursts a lung or two on Cruel Intentions; Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor lends his talents to the condensed carnival of Bad Blood; and Chris Keating from prog-rock oddballs Yeasayer provides vocals on baffling recent single Audacity of Huge. Also along for the ride are Telepathe, Jamie Lidell and Young Fathers, and each plays a part in the house party album of the season.\n\nBecause Temporary Pleasure is that, and more besides: an intense blast of shape-throwing marvellousness that rivals The Chemical Brothers at their superstar peak. You probably wouldn't want to hear it on repeat for 24 hours or anything, but for its 40-minute run time, SMD hog your attention in ways you'll find almost indecent (but in a good way, naturally). Experienced in the correct context, this is really quite stunning.\n\n1.\t&quot;Cream Dream&quot; (feat. Gruff Rhys)\t3:58\n2.\t&quot;Audacity of Huge&quot; (feat.
