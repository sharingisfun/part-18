Far from the listless meanderings of a group on its way out, however, the album is alive with emotion and creativity. The title track fuses a melody reminiscent of the Beatles&amp;#039; Indian explorations with a smartly done synthesiser arrangement typical of the disc as a whole. Similarly moody cuts like &quot;Soldiers&quot; and &quot;One of Us&quot; help make this that rare thing, an Abba record suited for lonely late nights. This 24-bit remaster boasts four bonus cuts, including the final singles &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot; and &quot;Under Attack&quot;, in addition to improved sound quality.
