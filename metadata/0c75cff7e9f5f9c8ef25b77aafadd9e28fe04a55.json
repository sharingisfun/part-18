Starting in 1764, an unidentified wolf-like animal ferociously mauled dozens of peasants in the GÃƒÂ©vaudan region of France. \n\nWhispered rumors of unnatural creatures blended with age-old superstition to cause mass hysteria. A werewolf was blamed for the carnage. Alarmed, King Louis XV sent his best huntsmen to rid the province of the beastly scourge, but this legendary massacre had only just begun. \n\nScarlette, a 19-year-old seamstress who is laboring to make ends meet, lives under this dark threat. Although fearful of the nightmarish monster lurking in the surrounding forest, she remains skeptical of the supernatural gossip.\n\nUntil her grandmother is attacked. \n\nScarlette learns that her grandmother has been infected by the animalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bite. Desperate to save her, Scarlette begins to uncover the dark secrets of her village and finds there are those who wish to keep their pasts hidden. As time grows short, Scarlette is befriended by a local nobleman and a woodcutter who both share an eerie history with the wolf. \n\nScarlette must unravel the menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s connection and solve a long-forgotten crime. But as she pieces together the clues, Scarlette finds herself torn between the two men. Both of them desire more than friendship and together hold the key to the cure. \n\nBased on both the traditional Grimm fairy-tale and older known French versions of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood,&quot; this dark Young Adult novel is set against the 18th century Beast of GÃƒÂ©vaudan attacks and blends fairy-tale with Gothic romance in a modern, accessible prose style. Unique to the genre, the novel revives the fable of the girl-in-the-red-cloak with a new historical angle that blurs the line between folklore and reality.\n\n\n\nGenre: Romance | Fantasy | Shapeshifters\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c75cff7e9f5f9c8ef25b77aafadd9e28fe04a55","amp;dn":"Davonna+Juroe+-+Scarlette+%28A+Paranormal+Fairy+Tale%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c75cff7e9f5f9c8ef25b77aafadd9e28fe04a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,117,207,247,233,245,249,200,239,37,183,122,175,173,217,226,143,224,74,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
