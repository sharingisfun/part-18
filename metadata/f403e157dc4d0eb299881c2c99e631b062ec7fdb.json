After cutting several demos, the duo recruited bassist Jonathan &quot;J.B.&quot; Brightman and drummer Devon Glenn and began performing live, quickly earning a local following for their swaggering, grunge-flavored music. Following the subsequent addition of second guitarist Yogi, Buckcherry signed with DreamWorks Records and issued their self-titled debut LP in 1999. Singles such as &quot;Check Your Head&quot; and &quot;For the Movies&quot; were modern rock hits, allowing Buckcherry to raise their profile by summer 2000. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tMp3 320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Gluttony\n02.Wrath\n03.Nothing Left But Tears\n04.The Truth\n05.Greed\n06.Water\n07.Seven Ways To Die\n08.Air\n09.Sloth\n10.Pride\n11.Envy\n12.Lust\n13.Dreamin' Of You\n14.Give 'Em What They Want (Bonus Track)\n15.When The Fire Starts (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f403e157dc4d0eb299881c2c99e631b062ec7fdb","amp;dn":"Buckcherry+-+Confessions+%5BDeluxe+Ed.%5D+%282013%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f403e157dc4d0eb299881c2c99e631b062ec7fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,3,225,87,220,77,14,178,153,136,28,44,153,230,49,176,98,236,127,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
