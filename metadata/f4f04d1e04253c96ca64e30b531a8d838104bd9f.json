Belli teaches him. In his work, he can become frustrated, so when he throws an expensive mower over a cliff in a fit of pique, his father banishes him to the outskirts of the farm, where he uses pubescent energy to break rocks and build walls and cairns. (It's the tradition of the father's family, called &quot;The Irascibles&quot; by neighbors, to spend puberty doing this.) Belli visits him and they begin sleeping together.\n\n\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093235/\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: DVDRip, PAL R2 Swiss, 25fps, color\nLanguage\tSwiss German\n\nFile Name .........................................: Hoehenfeuer.1985.DVDRip.Xvid.AC3.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,465,083,904 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) ..............................: 1:53:35 (13191984 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x416 (AR: 1.538)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1601 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.241 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 112 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nDownloaded from Karagarga tracker.
