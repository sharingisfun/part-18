O'Neill conceived the film partly as an answer to Godfrey Reggio's mind-numbing Koyaanisqatsi (1983), a hypnotic inventory of touristy landscapes showing a world out of balance. In contrast O'Neill creates images full of internal contradictions, using optical printing to collage different locales and suggest the inevitable conflict of industry and nature. One slow dissolve between the Owens Valley desert and Los Angeles at night suggests a direct cause and effect: the city flourished only by despoiling the land. Using time lapse to make weather changes visible, O'Neill renders people as fleeting shadows whose power to alter the landscape fails to mitigate the fragility and shortness of human life on a geologic scale.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img529.imageshack.us/img529/4941/23355541.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img529.imageshack.us/img529/4941/23355541.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/4591/26881610.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/4591/26881610.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3933/54544208.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3933/54544208.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------------not my rip--------------\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 907,005,952 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 54:54.056\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2001 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.272 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
