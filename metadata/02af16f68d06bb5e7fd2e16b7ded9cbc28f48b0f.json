Volume 1 includes literature before the twentieth century (alphabetical chapters from &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; to &quot;Transcendentalism&quot;), and volume 2 covers the twentieth century (&quot;Absurdism&quot; to &quot;Symbolism&quot;).\nEach chapter consists of an introduction, brief entries for representative authors and works, and discussion of themes, styles, variations, and historical context. An original signed critical essay is included in each chapter along with, in most cases, lengthy excerpts from one or more previously published critical works. Black-and-white photos, sidebars listing such items as media adaptations and suggested topics and resources for further study, bibliographies of source material, and annotated further reading lists complete most chapters. A particularly useful feature is &quot;Compare and Contrast,&quot; in which the cultural and historical background of each movement is compared to conditions in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.\nFront matter for each volume includes a volume-specific table of contents, a literary chronology, and a list of contributors (mostly freelance writers). Three indexes are found at the end: a &quot;Cumulative Author/Title Index,&quot; a &quot;Nationality/Ethnicity Index,&quot; and a &quot;Subject/Theme Index.&quot; Also at the end of each volume is a useful glossary defining and cross-referencing terms from abstract to zeitgeist.\n\nVolume 1\nNOVELS THAT INCLUDE THE NAMES OF\nFRENCH SOUPS . . . . . . . . . . xi\n(by Chris Semansky)\nINTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . xiii\nLITERARY CHRONOLOGY . . . . . . xvii\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS . . . . . . . xxxiii\nCONTRIBUTORS . . . . . . . . xxxvii\nABSURDISM. . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nBEAT MOVEMENT. . . . . . . . . . 29\nBILDUNGSROMAN. . . . . . . . . . 64\nCLASSICISM. . . . . . . . . . . . 97\nCOLONIALISM . . . . . . . . . . 122\nELIZABETHAN DRAMA . . . . . . . 153\nENLIGHTENMENT. . . . . . . . . 185\nEXISTENTIALISM. . . . . . . . . 222\nEXPRESSIONISM . . . . . . . . . 253\nGOTHIC LITERATURE . . . . . . . 281\nGREEK DRAMA. . . . . . . . . . 310\nHARLEM RENAISSANCE. . . . . . . 335\nHUMANISM . . . . . . . . . . . 374\nIMAGISM. . . . . . . . . . . . 405\n\nVolume 2\nMAGIC REALISM . . . . . . . . . 437\nMEDIEVAL MYSTICS . . . . . . . . 466\nMODERNISM . . . . . . . . . . 494\nNATURALISM . . . . . . . . . . 534\nNEOCLASSICISM . . . . . . . . . 556\nPOSTCOLONIALISM . . . . . . . . 593\nPOSTMODERNISM. . . . . . . . . 615\nREALISM. . . . . . . . . . . . 654\nRENAISSANCE LITERATURE . . . . . 682\nROMANTICISM. . . . . . . . . . 705\nSCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY LITERATURE . . . . . . . . . . 744\nSURREALISM . . . . . . . . . . 777\nSYMBOLISM. . . . . . . . . . . 802\nTRANSCENDENTALISM . . . . . . . 836\nSMALLER MOVEMENTS AND SCHOOLS. . 859\nGLOSSARY OF LITERARY TERMS. . . . xxxix\nCUMULATIVE AUTHOR/TITLE INDEX . . lxxiii\nCUMULATIVE NATIONALITY/ETHNICITY\nINDEX. . . . . . . . . . . . . lxxix\nCUMULATIVE SUBJECT/THEME INDEX. . lxxxv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02af16f68d06bb5e7fd2e16b7ded9cbc28f48b0f","amp;dn":"Literary+Movements+for+Students+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02af16f68d06bb5e7fd2e16b7ded9cbc28f48b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,175,22,246,141,6,187,94,127,210,225,107,125,237,156,188,40,244,139,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
