The work was originally published in Hungarian in 1958 by Pub Sport (Medicina, Budapest).\nGens una sumus! This was the motto adopted by F. I. D. Ãƒâ€°., and the series of Chess Olympiads which has lasted many years serves as positive proof of it. Over fifty nations now send their players every two years; every continent has been represented. Almost all the World Champions and contenders for the title have taken part in the Olympiads, not to mention numerous grandmasters and international masters, the 'common soldiers' of chess. Differences disappear over the chessboard; aristocrats by birth, fortune, or intellect are found side by side with those who have had to make a hard living as, for example, cabmen, fishermen, or waiters. There are players who devote most of their lives to chess and travel, while others, of amateur status, must largely confine their international appearances to the Olympiads. The Chess Olympiads are becoming more and more popular, but the singleness of purpose of the participants remains the same; namely, to be worthy representa-tives of their country in a noble contest.\n\nThis is one of my old &amp; rare chess books that I have scanned for you. I had bought it almost 30 years back &amp; it is still in perfect condition. Full cross-tables &amp; individual player scores of teams are given along with a large number of games in descriptive notation for each olympiad.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction 7\n1 London, 1927 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 1st Olympiad 13\n2 The Hague, 1928 Ã¢â‚¬â€ The 2nd Olympiad 29\n3 Hamburg, i93o^The 3rd Olympiad 46\n4 Prague, 1931 Ã¢â‚¬â€ The 4th Olympiad 68\n5 Folkestone, 1933 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 5th Olympiad 88\n6 Warsaw, 1935 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 6th Olympiad 107\n7 Munich, 1936 Ã¢â‚¬â€The Extra Olympiad 123\n8 Stockholm, 1937 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 7th Olympiad 140\n9 Buenos Aires, 1939Ã¢â‚¬â€ The 8th Olympiad 160\n10 Dubrovnik, 1950Ã¢â‚¬â€The 9th Olympiad 181\n11 Helsinki, 1952 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 10th Olympiad 198\n12 Amsterdam, 1954 Ã¢â‚¬â€The nth Olympiad 218\n13 Moscow, 1956 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 12th Olympiad 240\n14 Munich, 1958 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 13th Olympiad 264\n15 Leipzig, i960 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 14th Olympiad 286\n16 Varna, 1962 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 15th Olympiad 311\n17 Tel-Aviv, 1964 Ã¢â‚¬â€The 16th Olympiad 332\n18 Havana, 1966 - The 17th Olympiad 358\n19 Lugano, 1968 - The 18th Olympiad 383\nAppendix: Index of Players 411","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae95b524beab2868934fbd25d6e1c1b04db26843","amp;dn":"Chess+Olympiads+1927-1968+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae95b524beab2868934fbd25d6e1c1b04db26843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,149,181,36,190,171,40,104,147,79,189,37,214,225,193,176,77,178,104,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
