Its goal\r\nis to find, test, diagnose and repair hard disk\r\ndrive problems, report and display SSD and HDD\r\nhealth, performance degradations and failures. Hard\r\nDisk Sentinel gives complete textual description\r\ntips and displays/reports the most comprehensive\r\ninformation about the hard disks and solid state\r\ndisks inside the computer and in external\r\nenclosures (USB hard disks / e-SATA hard disks)\r\nMany different alerts and report options are\r\navailable to ensure maximum safety of your valuable\r\ndata\r\n\r\nNo need to use separate tools to verify internal\r\nhard disks, external hard disks, SSDs, hybrid disk\r\ndrives (SSHD), disks in RAID arrays as these are\r\nall included in a single software\r\n\r\nHard Disk Sentinel monitors hard disk drive / HDD\r\nstatus including health, temperature and all\r\nS.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting\r\nTechnology) values for all hard disks. Also it\r\nmeasures the disk transfer speed in real time which\r\ncan be used as a benchmark or to detect possible\r\nhard disk failures, performance degradations\r\n\r\nHDSentinel is the perfect data protection solution:\r\nit can be effectively used to prevent HDD failure\r\nand SSD / HDD data loss because it has the most\r\nsensitive disk health rating system which is\r\nextremely sensitive to disk problems. This way even\r\na small HDD problem can't be missed. The\r\nProfessional version has scheduled and automatic\r\n(on-problem) disk backup options to prevent data\r\nloss caused by not only failure but by malware or\r\naccidental delete also\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n1.
