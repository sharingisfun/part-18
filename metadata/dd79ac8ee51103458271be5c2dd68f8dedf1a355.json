These were all tv rips, some are better quality than others.\n\nVarook\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167720/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167720/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEver wish you could live your last week all over again? Well, my name\\&amp;#039;s Frank B. Parker, and I do it all the time. I work for a secret government project experimenting in time travel. When things really get screwed up, I\\&amp;#039;m the guinea pig they send back to take care of it. The catch is, I can only go back 7 days.\n\n\n7 Days chronicles the adventures of Frank Parker, a \\&quot;chrononaut\\&quot; assigned to the U.S. government\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Operation Back Step.\\&quot; The operation revolves around the Sphere, created by Dr.\\&amp;#039;s Mentnor, Vukavitch, and Ballard from alien technology salvaged from Roswell. The alien power source allows a jump of only seven days, so when a crisis occurs the government assigns NSA agent Frank Parker to jump back in time up to 7 days to prevent it, creating a new timeline where only Frank remembers the old one. Frank is uniquely qualified for the job - he has a high tolerance for pain (required during piloting), a photographic memory, and has had some psychiatric problems that give him a very...flexible mindset when dealing with altered timelines. Assisting him on his missions are project head Bradley Talmadge, head of security Nathan Ramsey, and military advisor and back-up chrononaut Craig Donovan. In the third season Ballard retires and his replacement \\&quot;Hooter\\&quot; Owsley takes his place as scientific expert and recurring guest star.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/7-days/show/273/summary.html?q=7%20days&amp;tag=search_results;title;1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/7-days/show/273/summary.html?q=7%20days&amp;tag=search_results;title;1&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd79ac8ee51103458271be5c2dd68f8dedf1a355","amp;dn":"7+Days+%28TV%29+Seasons+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd79ac8ee51103458271be5c2dd68f8dedf1a355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,121,172,142,229,17,3,69,130,113,190,92,45,214,143,141,237,241,163,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
