The game's popularity reached unparalleled worldwide proportions when, in 1993, a version of the game was released exclusively on the Japanese Sharp X68000 personal computer. Now, that version (called DRACULA X68000 in Japan) finally makes its way to domestic shores with this port for the PlayStation. It bears a striking resemblance to the first CASTLEVANIA titles, but this version boasts lots of new villains and additional levels. As with previous installments, the game requires you to move through 2D levels as vampire hunter, Simon Belmont. Using various weaponry, you'll try to defeat all of your attackers before they get the best of you. Improved graphics and expanded gameplay give this installment an edge on its predecessors, and you can actually tweak the audio and video presentation this time around.
