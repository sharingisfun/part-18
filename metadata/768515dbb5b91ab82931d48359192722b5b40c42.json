But when Jason scorns her for another woman, she unleashes a firestorm of revenge.\r\n\t\r\nMy notes,\r\n\r\n   Somewhere on the net I once got this film by Passolini and\r\na new dvd is now available from a production house called Entertainment One which includes  a film on the life of Maria Callas.\r\n\r\n   The documentary of Maria Callas, a star in every larger than life sense in talent and personal bravura is a treat I could not put up to share as a separate item.\r\n\r\n   The documentary is called  &quot;Maria Callas: La Divina - A Portrait&quot; (1988 TV Movie) \r\n\r\n   Runtime of Callas is 1 hr 10 min.\r\n\r\n  The production of Medea is a drama and non-singing role for Callas. It gives a primitive setting for the story of Medea steeped in ritual and native costume.  There is very much an African tribal feel to the music used and the production values.\r\n\r\n  As always, support the work by getting these classics for your libraries and theatre departments.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNotes written  September 10, 2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:768515dbb5b91ab82931d48359192722b5b40c42","amp;dn":"Medea+%281969%29++stars++Maria+Callas++and++documentary+on+Callas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"768515dbb5b91ab82931d48359192722b5b40c42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,133,21,219,181,185,26,184,41,49,212,131,89,25,39,34,181,180,12,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
