The band is now called &quot;Transit&quot;, and it brings this wonderful\nalbum of free improvisation. The first album was quite adventurous, with a very\ndense and loud, sometimes violent sound. This album is even more adventurous,\nbut they let silence in, and quietness. The result is one of increased tension,\nof an increased quality of the individual sounds, more attention to detail\n(much more), less struggling between the musicians to get space, and hence a\nmore mature interaction, if I may use that word. But over and beyond the\ntension, over and beyond the unusual and usual sound explorations, there is a\ndepth of feeling that is astonishing. The first track &quot;Strata&quot; already starts\nwith a strong trumpet performance by Wooley, going really deep, but the whole\nband excells in the slow and intense &quot;The Science Of Breath&quot;, a long piece on\nwhich the long interwoven tones create something of a hard to place beauty. And\neven if the horns define the most audible effects, listen how Arnal's drums\nshift the deep structure by evolving from screeching sounds out of his cymbals\ntoward hypnotic repetitive rhythms on his toms only. So much in the background\nyet defining the song's depth. &quot;Flip&quot; is more playful, toying with little\nsounds, interacting all four without falling into a pattern, almost, but not\nquite, and that's part of the fun, becoming elusive while playing the same\ngame. Fun is also there are the start of &quot;Rapid Eye Movement&quot;, with a nice\ninteraction between Radding's bass and Arnal's drumming, with Wooley and\nMisterka joining in the repetitive but weird sounds. Subtle and creative. &quot;Z\nTrain&quot; is more boppish - what else would you expect - in nature as defined by\nthe bass, with Arnal's drums going fully against the rhythm of the bass, while\nsax and trumpet play slow phrases over the rhythmic excitement. Another\nhighlight of the album is the long &quot;Speaking In Tongues&quot;, with Wooley leading\nthe piece with again a delight of a trumpet solo, that moves into a more\nAfrican tune and rhythm, but then in a context in which all options are still\nopen, without falling into clichÃƒÂ©s or patterns. In the hands of great musicians\nfree jazz is without a doubt the most rich and moving musical genre. And all\nfour of them excell here. The last track alone testifies to that. How they move\nthe piece from avant-garde sounds, to a more uptempo piece, on which Misterka\nreally shines with soulful and heartrending phrases. I have listened to this\nalbum at least a dozen times in the past few days, and it sounds different\nevery time. There is lots of variation, lots of creative approaches, and a joy\nto the ear. Don't miss it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e20af02995e491c9e136c106bc061a54979c0f","amp;dn":"Transit+-+Quadrologues+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e20af02995e491c9e136c106bc061a54979c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,226,10,240,41,149,228,145,201,225,54,193,6,188,6,26,84,151,156,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
