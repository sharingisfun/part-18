James wants us to see beyond the ornamental value of familiar plants and appreciate the role they can play in taking care of our health, and offers horticultural tips on the best plant varieties to select and how to grow and harvest them.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Exotic Plants \nEthnobotanist James Wong investigates plant-based medicine. Although his natural remedies for everyday minor ailments frequently use plants that we would consider to be exotic, many of these will grow really well in our own back gardens. James shows us how to use lemongrass in an insect repellent spray, transform olive leaves into a pampering face mask, make a soothing burns treatment from aloe vera and chamomile and, perhaps most surprisingly of all, reveals that, not only can you grow tea bushes in this country, you can also turn them into a zingy mouthwash to help fight plaque and freshen breath. Members of the public, in need of help, give his remedies and beauty treatments a go.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/8581/growyourowndrugsseries2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1573 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 29.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 350 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pst7w&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pst7w&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a96755c967a8a6a23eb3498cc324646871e9aa","amp;dn":"BBC+Grow+Your+Own+Drugs+Series+2+3of6+Exotic+Plants+PDTV+XviD+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a96755c967a8a6a23eb3498cc324646871e9aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,169,103,85,201,103,168,166,162,62,179,73,140,195,36,100,104,113,233,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
