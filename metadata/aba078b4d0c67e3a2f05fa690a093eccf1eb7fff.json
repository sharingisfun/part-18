Not anymore. But what if we could turn back time, to the days of the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker? The story of the rise and fall of the great British high street is brought to life in an entertaining and ambitious new series that transports four empty shops and a group of modern shopkeepers and their families back to the birth of the high street in the 1870s, before propelling them through a century of dizzying change, right up to the 1970s. Over six hours of gripping television, the families lives are turned upside down as they experience how shopkeepers lived and worked in six key eras of British history. But this High Street is no museum. \n\n\n3)  It's the 1930s \nIn this episode it's the 1930s. Life should be sweeter this week as government regulations reduce working hours and cheap sugar means lots of sweets, confectionary and cake. Nostalgia boosts sales for the grocers who have masses of 1930s recognisable brands, the dressmaker has to sell thirties glamour to the town and the butcher has good old British beef. The Edwardian bazaar is now a toy shop reflecting the shopkeepers' target customers - children. But it's far from plain sailing; the Bakers find themselves running a cake shop but cakes aren't their forte. Rivalry builds between the grocers and the butchers underminding the community spirit of the high street. The shopkeepers spend a week selling the 1930s to the town but they have to pull out all the stops for Empire day - a day for children, can they persuade a whole new generation of the joys of the traditional high street?\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/2323/thehighstreetscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/2323/thehighstreetscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2633/thehighstreetscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2633/thehighstreetscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6963/thehighstreetscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6963/thehighstreetscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7945/thehighstreetscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7945/thehighstreetscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/4961/thehighstreetscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/4961/thehighstreetscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8330/thehighstreetscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8330/thehighstreetscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7234/thehighstreetscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7234/thehighstreetscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6960/thehighstreetscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6960/thehighstreetscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7429/thehighstreetscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7429/thehighstreetscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7994/thehighstreetscreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7994/thehighstreetscreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6638/thehighstreetscreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6638/thehighstreetscreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/88/thehighstreetscreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/88/thehighstreetscreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1603 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source : DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sheptonmallet.co/turnbacktime.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sheptonmallet.co/turnbacktime.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aba078b4d0c67e3a2f05fa690a093eccf1eb7fff","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+High+Street+3of6+1930s+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aba078b4d0c67e3a2f05fa690a093eccf1eb7fff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,160,120,180,208,198,126,58,47,5,250,105,10,9,62,204,241,235,127,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
