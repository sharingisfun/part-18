The records feature an 'E' logo on the front label around the words 'Limited Edition'. Identical releases may sometimes have extra rubber stamping details or have no details on them whatsoever. Identical releases may also have different coloured 'E' logos, though this is mostly not the case. Some vinyl may have a secondary spot colour stamp using a different letter set pad. If lucky details may be hand written or even scribbled out by pen - apparently by 'The Workshop' production team of N19, London. Some of the official track titles have kindly been provided by Paul 'Ibiza' himself for Discogs.\n\nParent Label:\n\nIbiza Records &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/label/Ibiza+Records&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/label/Ibiza+Records&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ba75c47b6ca607681aea478ceda74aea37a1523","amp;dn":"Limited+E+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ba75c47b6ca607681aea478ceda74aea37a1523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,167,92,71,182,202,96,118,129,174,164,120,206,218,116,174,163,122,21,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
