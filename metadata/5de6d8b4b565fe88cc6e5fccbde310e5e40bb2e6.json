The series was produced by 20th Century Fox Television and stars Sarah Chalke as Polly whoÃ¢â‚¬â€along with her daughterÃ¢â‚¬â€ends up moving into her parents' house because of the financial crisis and her divorce.\n\nOn May 10, 2013, How to Live With Your Parents was canceled by ABC.\n\n\n\n\nPlot:\n----------\nThe series follows a single and very uptight divorced mother, Polly (Chalke) who finds herself moving back in with her parents, Elaine and Max (Elizabeth Perkins and Brad Garrett), upon leaving her husband and due to the economic downturn. Polly's parents are laid back and relaxed despite Elaine not raising her properly because of mumbling inappropriate things to her growing up. But the return is not as smooth and transitional as she thinks while having to deal with not only her parents and their lifestyle, but also with a best friend whom she almost dated and an ex-husband who wants her back as she prepares to restart her life.\n\n\n\nCast: Sarah Chalke\n      Elizabeth Perkins\n      Jon Dore\n      Rachel Eggleston\n      Stephanie Hunt\n      Brad Garrett\n\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nResolution: 1912x1072\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio (aka AC3)(a52)\nChannels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: WEB-DL\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\nActual Screenshots:\n---------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7373/3a8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7373/3a8.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/9901/qqsr.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/9901/qqsr.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/4553/2qp3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/4553/2qp3.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4877/tdh6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4877/tdh6.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/5222/mx4w.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/5222/mx4w.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIMDb:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2226397/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2226397/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://beta.abc.go.com/shows/how-to-live-with-your-parents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://beta.abc.go.com/shows/how-to-live-with-your-parents&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Live_with_Your_Parents_(For_the_Rest_of_Your_Life)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Live_with_Your_Parents_(For_the_Rest_of_Your_Life)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, TvTeam, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n\n\nOther CARG releases can be found at ExtraTorrent &amp; KickassTorrent\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5de6d8b4b565fe88cc6e5fccbde310e5e40bb2e6","amp;dn":"How+to+Live+with+Your+Parents+Season+1+Complete+1080p+WEB-DL.DD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5de6d8b4b565fe88cc6e5fccbde310e5e40bb2e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,230,216,180,181,101,254,136,204,110,95,204,189,227,16,229,228,11,178,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
