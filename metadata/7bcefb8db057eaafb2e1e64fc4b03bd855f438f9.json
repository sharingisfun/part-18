In 1966 she moved to Rosario, Santa Fe, in order to study Philosophy, and has since become an adoptive citizen. In her youth she took part in the vocal groups Contracanto and Canto Libre. She was arrested by the military government for her involvement in Peronist movements.\n\nIn Rosario she met the local singer and composer Fito Paez, who convinced her of abandoning her teaching career and become a professional singer. Paez was the producer of Herrero's first record, in 1987. This album was also the first that Paez produced. Its music was what they called &quot;supermodern folklore&quot;. In 1989 Paez also produced Herrero's second album.\n\nHerrero said once that her music not a fusion between Argentine folklore and rock, as some had defined it, but a culture clash ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ two different traditions facing each other.\n\nIn 1993 Herrero released her third album, Isla del Tesoro (&quot;Treasure Island&quot;), with several guests, including Fito Paez, Ricardo Mollo (Divididos), Claudia Puyo and Beto Satragni.\n\nIn 1995 she received the Konex Award as one of the best five interpreters of the decade. She was the Argentine representative in the Non-Governmental Organizations Forum of the International Women's Conference in Beijing, China. Her performance was broadcast by national radio....\n\n\n\np.s.
