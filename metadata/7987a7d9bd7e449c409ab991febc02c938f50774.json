The book contains sixteen chapters covering several interesting research topics written by researchers and experts from several countries. The research reported in this book is useful to graduate students and researchers working in the fields of structural and earthquake engineering. The book will also be of considerable help to civil engineers working on construction and repair of engineering structures, such as buildings, roads, dams and monuments.\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7987a7d9bd7e449c409ab991febc02c938f50774","amp;dn":"Advances+In+Geotechnical+EarthQuake+Engineering-2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7987a7d9bd7e449c409ab991febc02c938f50774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,135,167,217,189,126,68,156,64,154,185,145,254,188,2,201,56,245,7,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
