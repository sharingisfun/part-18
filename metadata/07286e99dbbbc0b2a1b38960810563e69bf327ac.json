Rappaport crafts a zany anti-melodrama about female imprisonment in romantic dreams, delusions, and anxieties. He reminds us that raw experience is a myth. We live in a culture where our food is processed, our possessions manufactured, and our entertainment market-tested. Why should our fantasies be any different? They are as mass-produced as our automobiles; our emotions as synthetic as designer fabrics. And as quickly in or out of fashion. Run, run, as fast as you can; you can't keep up with the Gingerbread Man. In Rappaport's power-saturated vision of life, individualism has gone the way of the vacuum tube radio. We are antennas resonating to a surging force field of cultural energies. Our identities are as artificial as our art, our love affairs as elaborately conjugated as a Latin verb. - Ray Carney\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140536/\nRATING: 8.1/10 25 votes\n\n\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,467,084,800\nRuntime ...............: 1:16:15\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 137085\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ............: 704 x 528\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 2426\n\nAudio Codec ...........: MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000\nAudio bitrate .........: 128 VBR\nNo. of audio streams ..: 2\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4120425458/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4120425458/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4120425620/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4120425620/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4119651413/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4119651413/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4120425942/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4120425942/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
