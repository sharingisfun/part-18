The band was known for its extreme complexity and sophistication of its music and for the varied musical skills of its members. All of the band members, except Malcolm Mortimore, were multi-instrumentalists. While never achieving the commercial heights of progressive rock contemporaries such as Jethro Tull, Genesis, Yes or Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer; Gentle Giant was considered to be one of the most experimental bands in the genre. Gentle Giant's music was considered complex even by progressive rock standards, drawing on a broad swath of music including folk, soul, jazz, and classical music. Unlike many of their progressive rock contemporaries, their &quot;classical&quot; influences ranged beyond the Romantic and incorporated medieval, baroque, and modernist chamber music elements. The band also had a taste for broad themes for their lyrics, drawing inspiration not only from personal experiences but from philosophy and the works of both FranÃƒÂ§ois Rabelais and R.D. Laing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adbe0d688e17ff6a17c6c4292f6e73ca8029a3ff","amp;dn":"Gentle+Giant+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adbe0d688e17ff6a17c6c4292f6e73ca8029a3ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,190,13,104,142,23,255,106,23,198,196,41,47,110,115,202,128,41,163,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
