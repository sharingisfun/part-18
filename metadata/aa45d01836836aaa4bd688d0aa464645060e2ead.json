Stop Us If You've Heard \nThis Before draws deeply from those formative years with an early, live \nversion of &quot;Same Thing,&quot; a live cover of the Beastie Boys &quot;Shake Your Rump,&quot; \nthe demo for longtime favorite &quot;Old Apartment,&quot; and the previously \nunreleased live track &quot;Teenage Wasteland.&quot; Also included from that era is the \nrare Pull s Break Remix version of &quot;One Week,&quot; the smash that helped propel \nthe Barenaked Ladies to international stardom in 1998. Stop Us also unearths \nseveral unreleased tracks recorded during sessions for Everything To \nEveryone (2003), including &quot;Long While&quot; and &quot;I Don t Get It Anymore,&quot; along \nwith the demo for the album track &quot;Second Best.&quot; Also included from those \nsessions are versions of &quot;Half A Heart&quot; and &quot;Adrift&quot; - two songs the band \nlater re-recorded for Barenaked Ladies Are Me (2006). The collection offers \ntwo remaining gems: an early version of &quot;I Can, I Will, I Do&quot; recorded in 2001 \nduring sessions for Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits; and &quot;Yes, Yes, Yes,&quot; a \nsong previously available only as a UK b-side or as a bonus track from the \ndeluxe version of Everything To Everyone.\n\nReview by Matt Collar\n\nThe 2012 rarities compilation, Stop Us If You've Heard This One Before! collects live and unreleased cuts recorded between 1992 and 2003 by the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies. Included are such songs as a 1996 demo version of &quot;Old Apartment,&quot; a 1994 live recording of &quot;Shake Your Rump,&quot; a 1998 remix of &quot;One Week,&quot; and a handful of unreleased songs including &quot;Half a Heart&quot; from 2000, a 2002 demo of &quot;Long While,&quot; and others. Originally planned as a companion piece to 2011's greatest-hits compilation Hits from Yesterday &amp; the Day Before, Stop Us If You've Heard This One Before! turns out to be a pleasant single-disc collection of cuts that should appeal to longtime fans or work as a nice introduction to the band.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa45d01836836aaa4bd688d0aa464645060e2ead","amp;dn":"Barenaked+Ladies+-+Stop+Us+If+You%27ve+Heard+This+One+Before%21+%5Bfla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa45d01836836aaa4bd688d0aa464645060e2ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,69,208,24,54,131,106,170,75,214,136,208,170,70,70,69,6,14,46,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
