He now lives in a village in rural Poland where he works with teenagers with behavioral problems who fight and yell abuse. He declines the advances of a young brunette named Ewa; saying he is already spoken for. However; celibacy is not the only reason for his rejection. Adam knows that he desires men and that his embrace of the priesthood has been a flight from his own sexuality. When he meets Dynia; the strange and taciturn son of a simple rural family; Adam's self-imposed abstinence becomes a heavy burden. \n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75e002d4b17df5f699f51249b65fd8d462ca2fe6","amp;dn":"W+Imie+aka+In+The+Name+Of+2013+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75e002d4b17df5f699f51249b65fd8d462ca2fe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,224,2,212,177,125,245,246,153,245,18,73,182,95,216,212,98,202,47,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
