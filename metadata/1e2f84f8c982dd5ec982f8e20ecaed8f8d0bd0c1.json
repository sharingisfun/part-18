Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, has reorganized, extended, and completely \n\nrewritten his definitive reference and tutorial for programmers who want to use C++ most effectively.\n \nThe C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition, delivers meticulous, richly explained, and integrated coverage of the entire \n\nlanguageÃ¢â‚¬â€its facilities, abstraction mechanisms, standard libraries, and key design techniques. Throughout, Stroustrup \n\npresents concise, Ã¢â‚¬Å“pure C++11Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ examples, which have been carefully crafted to clarify both usage and program design. To \n\npromote deeper understanding, the author provides extensive cross-references, both within the book and to the ISO standard.\n \nNew C++11 coverage includes\nSupport for concurrency\nRegular expressions, resource management pointers, random numbers, and improved containers\nGeneral and uniform initialization, simplified for-statements, move semantics, and Unicode support\nLambdas, general constant expressions, control over class defaults, variadic templates, template aliases, and user-defined \n\nliterals\nCompatibility issues \nTopics addressed in this comprehensive book include\nBasic facilities: type, object, scope, storage, computation fundamentals, and more\nModularity, as supported by namespaces, source files, and exception handling\nC++ abstraction, including classes, class hierarchies, and templates in support of a synthesis of traditional programming, object-oriented programming, and generic programming\nStandard Library: containers, algorithms, iterators, utilities, strings, stream I/O, locales, numerics, and more\nThe C++ basic memory model, in depth \nThis fourth edition makes C++11 thoroughly accessible to programmers moving from C++98 or other languages, while introducing insights and techniques that even cutting-edge C++11 programmers will find indispensable.\n \nThis book features an enhanced, layflat binding, which allows the book to stay open more easily when placed on a flat surface. This special binding methodÃ¢â‚¬â€noticeable by a small space inside the spineÃ¢â‚¬â€also increases durability.\n\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments. \n\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.\n\nSupport Amas school of technology. The only school of its kind in an entire 3rd world country that doesn't force poor people to pay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e2f84f8c982dd5ec982f8e20ecaed8f8d0bd0c1","amp;dn":"The+C%2B%2B+Programming+Language+4th+ed.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e2f84f8c982dd5ec982f8e20ecaed8f8d0bd0c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,47,132,248,201,130,221,94,201,130,248,226,14,202,237,143,141,11,208,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
