Media scholars and health professionals help us understand the ways in which direct-to-consumer (DTC) pharmaceutical advertising glamorizes and normalizes the use of prescription medication, and works in tandem with both industry-sponsored medical education/research and promotion to doctors. Big Bucks, Big Pharma challenges us to ask important questions about the consequences of relying on a for-profit industry for our health and well-being. From the Media Education Foundation.\n\nBig Pharma is one of Washington\\'s most powerful interest groups. \n============================================\nPBS.FRONTLINE.Dangerous.Prescription\nAs medications assume ever-larger roles in health care, the importance of FDA approval mounts. But what do average Americans know about the FDA process? What happens when a drug product harms consumers, and what role do drug companies play in approving and monitoring drugs? DANGEROUS PRESCRIPTION offers a FRONTLINE investigation into the FDA and drug safety, showing how effective the FDA is at identifying drugs that don\\'t work or cause harm.\nibobaine on\n\nWe Become Silent - The Last Days of Health Freedom (2006)\nInternational award-winning filmmaker Kevin P.

Fear sells. And nowhere is fear peddled more shamelessly than in the fields of medicine and human nutrition. And of course the fear mongers are also praying on fear of disease. And the solution that the fear mongers give us are drugs. Yet drugs are the single most dangerous thing we can put in our mouths.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½\\&quot;Fear anesthetizes us. It coerces us, making us believe we can do little on our own to prevent or treat disease. And forces whole nations to kneel at the alters of the drug industries.

Last year between 3 and 5 billion prescriptions were written in the U.S. alone.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½\n    ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½But the fear machine is well oiled by petrochemical dollars, and a near worldwide monopoly in health care. It works overtime to prevent the truth about dietary supplements from getting out to the public. Governments, particularly in Europe and the United States seem all to eager to comply with the robber barons of health care.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½\n    ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½There are some who say this battle cannot be won.
