Today he decides to take the day off school. When Ferris takes the day off, so must his best friends, Cameron and Sloane. Cameron is reluctantly persuaded to borrow his father's Ferrari, and together they hatch a plan to get Sloane out of class. Suspicious dean of students Ed Rooney knows all about Ferris, but can never catch him. Ferris' sister Jeanie is also frustrated that Ferris always gets away with his tricks and she doesn't. Furthermore, Ferris is an 'angel' in his parents eyes. It's Ferris' day off, he's out to enjoy himself, and he does!. \n\nStarring: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck and Mia Sara\n\nDirector: John Hughes\n\n\nSCREENSHOT SLIDESHOW\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/slideshow/webplayer.php?id=ferrisdvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/slideshow/webplayer.php?id=ferrisdvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a4658485b590c428c463372b8111bbe11a592a","amp;dn":"Ferris+Buellers+Day+Off+%7B1986%7D+720p+BRRip+x264+-+HDMiCRO+by+Mr.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00a4658485b590c428c463372b8111bbe11a592a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,164,101,132,133,181,144,196,40,196,99,55,43,129,17,187,225,26,89,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
