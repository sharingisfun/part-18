Now, Sean Carroll says we need to be more ambitious. One of the leading theoretical physicists of his generation, Carroll delivers a dazzling and paradigm-shifting theory of time's arrow that embraces subjects from entropy to quantum mechanics to time travel to information theory and the meaning of life.\n \n \nFrom Eternity to Here is no less than the next step toward understanding how we came to exist, and a fantastically approachable read that will appeal to a broad audience of armchair physicists, and anyone who ponders the nature of our world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dded4d4690b07dafa563d33e76e7534ef1a13c21","amp;dn":"From+Eternity+to+Here+-+The+Quest+for+the+Ultimate+Theory+of+Tim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dded4d4690b07dafa563d33e76e7534ef1a13c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,237,77,70,144,176,125,175,165,99,211,62,118,231,83,78,241,161,60,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
