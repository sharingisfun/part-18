But she's hungry, the kids are hungry, they\nneed to find something to eat before nightfall. She's going\nto try fishing, and wades out into the cold waves. It's a\ncrazy thing to do, and the little ones follow Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nWhen she returns, there is only one with her: the other\nhas drowned. It's so desperately sad, and it was so avoidable.\nShe's a terrible mum, stupid and irresponsible. She almost\nloses the other one later Ã¢â‚¬â€œ twice. Someone should tell social\nservices. Bear social services.\nYeah, they're grizzly bears in Alaska. This is The Great\nBear Stakeout (BBC1). I know it's not helpful to think of\nanimal behaviour in terms of what is or isn't acceptable\nin humans, but it's hard not to. Especially when they're\ngiven names, and the bear dudes talk about them as if\nthey're people. &quot;You know what they say, bears are just\nlike humans,&quot; says bear expert Chris Morgan. &quot;Well, no,\nhumans are just like bears.&quot;\nBack to the beach, and the bad behaviour continues. It's the\nstart of the sexing season: young males are fighting each\nother and pissing everywhere. It's like the centre of\nColchester Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or almost anywhere else in Britain, for that\nmatter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on a Friday night. Another young mum called Lucy\nabandons her son, Solo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not just for the evening, for ever\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ because she fancies a shag. Poor Solo is left running\naround in a right panic, looking for his mum.\nHe's properly Solo now.\nVan, a massive brute and a bully who could totally play the\nmeadow, have any lady he wants, has fallen for a pretty,\nfair-haired bear called Alice, who turns out to be a total\ncow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if a bear can be a cow. She strings Van along, makes\nout he's the one, but she's not ready to mate yet. Then,\nwhen Van's off rolling in seaweed (bear Lynx, basically),\nAlice lets an opportunistic young male hop on and have his\nwicked way. &quot;Sneaky male syndrome,&quot; says Chris the bear\nexpert, expertly. Then, when big Van comes back,\nAlice starts chasing her new boyfriend away and pretends\nhaving sex with him was a terrible mistake. &quot;She's a nightmare\n&quot; says Chris. &quot;Unbelievable, she is so deceitful and nasty.&quot;\nVan and Alice do get it on eventually, in truly appalling\ncircumstances. Another female shows up; she has come down\nfrom the mountains for a bit of action. Well, why not, when\neveryone else is at it? Trouble is, she picks Van to make\neyes at. Alice gets jealous and attacks the newcomer, Van\njoins in, pushes Alice off, lays into the other bear Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and\nkills her. Jesus. And more disturbing even than that, it's\nthe killing of this rival, in which she acted as accomplice,\nthat finally makes Alice fancy Van. Forget the bear Lynx:\nmurder her (I'll help), then I'm all yours. Look, they're\ngrunting away disgustingly, while another bear goes in to\nbite chunks from the corpse which just a few moments ago\nwas a beautiful female, frisking flirtily about the meadow.\nI think they're really horrid, these bears. Bad parents;\nstupid, deceitful, callous murderers; killers for sex kicks;\nand cannibals. Then there's all the scratching, and the swarms\nof flies, and the pissing. (No woods here, though, interestingly\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ so is the Pope a Muslim?)\nAmazing footage, though. Brave, too: I wouldn't go anywhere\nnear Van or Alice or any of them, let alone spend five months\ncamping among them. Good work, then, Chris and Buck Wilde\n(good name for a bear expert, no?) and the rest. And from the\nremote cameras, which film where even Buck doesn't dare go Ã¢â‚¬â€œ\nsuch as inside a grizzly's gaping mouth. God, that must have\nbeen the last thing Timothy Treadwell ever saw. Remember Tim,\nfrom Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man film, who ended up inside one\nof the bears he loved so much? That's the trouble with any bear\ndocumentary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ however brilliant the footage, it's never going to\nbe as good a film as Herzog's, because that had an amazing human\nstory as well as the bears.\nBilly Connolly deserves a mention, doing the narration,\nchuckling away; he's enjoying it. I think Billy identifies\nwith the bears.\nEpisode 1. The cameras follow Parsnip, a first-time grizzly mum,\nand her young cub, Pushki.\nEpisode 2. The salmon run arrives in Alaska, and Parsnip and Pushki\nreturn to the bay to feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal SOURCE: BBCHD &lt; Cheers\nVideo: MP4/H264/852*480/25fps\nAudio: AAC/2ch/128Kbps\nSample Included: Yes\nFile Size: 700/714MB\nCode:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ca9366520a72771d53f48beaaa3cd4c5d7e481b","amp;dn":"BBC+Great+Bear+Stakeout+%5B2013%5D480p.HDTVRip.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ca9366520a72771d53f48beaaa3cd4c5d7e481b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,169,54,101,32,167,39,113,213,63,72,190,170,163,205,76,93,126,72,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
