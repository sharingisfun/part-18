In this new biography, published on the centennial of the writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, Jerome Loving focuses on Mark Twain, humorist and quipster, and sheds new light on the wit, pathos, and tragedy of the famous writer. In brisk and compelling fashion, Loving follows Twain from Hannibal to Hawaii to the Holy Land, showing how the southerner transformed himself into a westerner and finally a New Englander. This re-examination of TwainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is informed by newly discovered archival materials that provide the most complex view of the man and writer to date.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0eeb681bd6159a80434b4190866b2bb9495d95c","amp;dn":"Mark+Twain+The+Adventures+of+S.+L.+Clemens+by+Jerome+Loving.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0eeb681bd6159a80434b4190866b2bb9495d95c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,238,182,129,189,97,89,168,4,52,180,25,8,102,178,187,148,149,217,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
