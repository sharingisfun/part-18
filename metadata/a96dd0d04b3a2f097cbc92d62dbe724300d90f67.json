Malveau, Thomas J. Mowbray\nLanguage: eng\nISBN13: 9780130274076\nISBN10: 0130274070\n\n\nThis is more than a book about software architecture. It is a field manual that can train\nyou. We choose the pseudomilitary style, because it embodies an essential attitude. As a\nsoftware architect, you need many survival skillsÃ¢â‚¬â€ some technical, some political, some\npersonal. While neither author has mili- tary experience, we have seen software\narchitecture become a battleground in many ways. It is a battleground of ideas, as\ndevelopers compete to forward their own concepts. It is a battleground for control of key\ndesign decisions that may be overruled by managers or developers, perhaps covertly. It is\na battleground with many risks, since architects are responsible for a much wider range of\ntechnical and process risks than most managers or individual developers.\nIf you are a practicing software architect, we know that you are a busy professional. After\nbuying this book, we would suggest that you peruse the table of contents and the index\nfor topics that are new to you. Focus on those sections first. When you have time, we\nsuggest that you attempt a cover-to-cover read-through, to familiarize yourself with all of\nthe covered topics and terminology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a96dd0d04b3a2f097cbc92d62dbe724300d90f67","amp;dn":"Software+Architect+Bootcamp+1st+edition+pdf+++2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a96dd0d04b3a2f097cbc92d62dbe724300d90f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,109,208,208,75,58,47,9,124,188,146,214,45,190,114,67,0,217,15,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
