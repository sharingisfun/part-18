You choose the club name and kit colours and you assemble your squad. Recreate a classic team or build a squad of family and friends and then enter them into any league or international competition to compete against todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real teams and players. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the ultimate football fantasy experience.\n- A more realistic transfer system with more intelligent bids and squad management from AI managers meaning the FMH transfer market reflects the real-world.\n- Use the new player progression tracking system to monitor the progress of your playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attributes over time. These pages chart the improvement or decline of your playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ skills and are the perfect visual aid for making those tough decisions on whether players have a future at the club.\n- Improved media interaction, with questions from reporters about your clubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s successes, failures and the future. Can you keep the media happy without upsetting the board, fans and squad?\n- Improved post-match analysis gives you better feedback on your team's tactical strengths and weaknesses. \n- More detailed historic records of previous seasons allow you to look back fondly on past successes.\n- You can now choose multiple nations when starting a new game, so your career is no longer limited to one country... you can start managing an English club, but move abroad to manage in another country if you fancy a different challenge or a change in culture*. \n*This feature is not available on all devices.
