Stressing the importance of a structured approach to problem solving, the text gives a step-by-step method for program design and algorithm development. The fundamentals of MATLAB are illustrated throughout with many examples from a wide range of familiar scientific and engineering areas, as well as from everyday life.\n\nFeatures:\n\n. Numerous simple exercises provide hands-on learning of MATLAB's functions\n. A new chapter on dynamical systems shows how a structured approach is used to solve more complex problems.\n. Common errors and pitfalls highlighted\n. Concise introduction to useful topics for solving problems in later engineering and science courses: vectors as arrays, arrays of characters, GUIs, advanced graphics, simulation and numerical methods\n. Text and graphics in four colour\n. Extensive instructor support\n\nEssential MATLAB for Engineers and Scientists is an ideal textbook for a first course on MATLAB or an engineering problem solving course using MATLAB, as well as a self-learning tutorial for students and professionals expected to learn and apply MATLAB for themselves.\n\nAdditional material is available for lecturers only at http://textbooks.elsevier.com.
