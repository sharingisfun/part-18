Fresh out of high school, Zach (Trevor Wright) gives up a full scholarship to spare his 5-year-old nephew from their dysfunctional family. Now restless and isolated, the gifted youth toils at a local diner. But everything changes when he finds himself drawn to thirtysomething Shaun (Brad Rowe, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss), a confident young writer. As the two hit the surf and Shaun's mattress with equal enthusiasm, they fall into a secret relationship that may give Zach the courage he needs to follow his passions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bdd86fec39e547515138732641431498de06170","amp;dn":"Shelter+%282007%29+Gay+Int.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bdd86fec39e547515138732641431498de06170","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,221,134,254,195,158,84,117,21,19,135,50,100,20,49,73,141,224,97,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
