I am writing this letter not for me but for my father, Kurt Frederick Muse. As you should know by now, he is a political prisoner in Panama.....\n\nKurt Muse handed over his passport at Torrijos International Airport, just as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d done countless times. Instantly, he sensed that something was wrong. Rather than the cursory glance followed by the whack of the entry stamp, the bureaucrat held the little book in both hands. He seemed to be studying it. And then he smiled. Kurt followed the clerkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gaze to a piece of paper taped to his partition. The sign was handwritten in Spanish:\n\nKurt Muse American Citizen Arrest Him\n\nHis life was over.\n\nBorn in the United States, raised in Panama, Kurt Muse grew up with a deep love for his adopted country. But by the late 1980s, Panama was suffering under the regime of Manuel Noriega. Innocent people disappeared. Beatings and murders became commonplace.\n\nFor Kurt Muse, accepting such a dictator was not an option. For two years, Kurt and a few friends operated clandestine radio stations on low-tech equipment smuggled into Panama. At first, they broadcast on a small scale. But in late 1987, the group realized that they could override any transmission from a government-run radio network, and Radio Constitucional was born.\n\nMuse and his compatriots chose NoriegaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Loyalty Day address, simulcast on every radio station in the country, for its first transmission. Just as Noriega began his self-serving message, Radio Constitucional seized the airwaves, urging the people to rise up in defense of their freedom. Kurt knew that if his identity was revealed, he and his family would be in grave peril. But he had no idea what kind of terror, confusion, and betrayal lay in store for all of them.\n\nSix Minutes to Freedom spins the remarkable tale of KurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrest by NoriegaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s henchmen and his months of imprisonment; the squalid conditions he faced in PanamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infamous Modelo Prison; his eyewitness accounts of his fellow inmatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ torture; and the plight of KurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family as they fled for their lives. And it reveals, for the first time, the astonishing details of the long-awaited day when helicopters arrived in a firestorm of bullets to whisk Kurt Muse from under the noses of thugs who had been ordered to kill him.\n\nThis is KurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thrilling and highly personal storyÃ¢â‚¬â€the story of an American hero on foreign soil, who risked his life for his beliefs and for freedomÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and became the only American civilian ever rescued by the elite Delta Force.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction/ Central &amp; South America/ Politics &amp; Government/ Political Prisoners/Biography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b31c252a85192b12ca56efad183c56b8bdc81fde","amp;dn":"Six+Minutes+to+Freedom+by+Kurt+Muse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b31c252a85192b12ca56efad183c56b8bdc81fde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,28,37,42,133,25,43,18,202,86,239,173,24,60,86,184,189,200,31,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
