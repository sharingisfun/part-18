As Stu Bangas clarifies: &quot;I was\nin contact with an associate of Blaq's for a few years, we\nreconnected again in late 2008 and I asked him to get in\ntouch with Poet for a mixtape I was working on. He talked to\nPoet, relayed I was interested in working with him and\nvouched for me and I ended up going to Long Island too shoot\na video for a joint Poet hopped on that I produced in 2009.\nWhen I got back to Boston, I decided I wanted to work on an\nalbum with him and we decided to move forward with it. I\nreached out to my partner Vanderslice and he was excited to\ncontribute production as well. The type of beats Vanderslice\nand I excel at are big sounding, gangster shit, the type of\nsound Poet excels over.&quot;\n\nWe Have NO Public IRC\nchannel and offer no\nfiles.
