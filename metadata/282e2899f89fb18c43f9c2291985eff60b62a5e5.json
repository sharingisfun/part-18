It\ndoes so principally from the viewpoints of two people: a newspaper\nreporter and a soldier.\n\n&quot;Tubby&quot; Bins, a British corporal (Mills) is trying to get his men to Dunkirk,\nwhere they, the rest of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and\nthousands of French soldiers hope to be evacuated. After their officer is\nkilled in a bomber attack, it is up to Tubby to keep his demoralized\ncharges motivated. They eventually get a lift in a RAF lorry and make it to\nthe beaches.\n\nParallel to this action is the story of Charles Foreman (Lee), a cynical\njournalist who is trying to raise morale amongst his depressed readers.\nWhen the Admiralty commandeers his motorboat to aid the evacuation\nfrom Dunkirk, Foreman is inspired to volunteer his services and take the\nboat across the Channel himself, despite warnings of the danger. A\nfriend, Holden (Attenborough), a motor engineer and successful\nbusinessman does the same, albeit reluctantly. Taking part in the rescue\nare ships of the Royal Navy and hundreds of civilian vessels of all shapes\nand sizes - &quot;The Little Ships&quot;.\n\nOn the beaches of Dunkirk, Foreman and Tubby meet, but Foreman is\nfatally wounded in an attack by German aeroplanes. Although Foreman's\nboat is wrecked, Holden's Heron makes it safely to Britain.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/7d879942257260&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/7d879942257260&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n* John Mills as Cpl.
