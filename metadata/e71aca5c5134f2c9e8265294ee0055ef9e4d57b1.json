He is considered one of the best and most influential musicians and authors in Italian pop/rock music history.\nBattisti started his career in 1966 and from 1969 to 1994 he released 18 albums in his home country. A significant part of his production was translated into Spanish (various albums) and English (one album). He was renowned to be an extremely reserved artist: during his successful career he performed only a relatively small number of live exhibitions and, in 1976, he stated he would communicate only through his studio albums, completely disappearing from Italian public scene.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e71aca5c5134f2c9e8265294ee0055ef9e4d57b1","amp;dn":"%5BMp3+ITA%5D+LUCIO+BATTISTI+-+FULL+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e71aca5c5134f2c9e8265294ee0055ef9e4d57b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,26,202,92,81,52,242,201,232,38,82,148,238,0,85,239,158,77,87,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
