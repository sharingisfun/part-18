At that point nobody realised the incredible impact Gauguin's work was to have on modern art.\nArt critic and broadcaster Waldemar Januszczak wrote and directed this examination of a man who was not only a great painter but sculptor, wood carver, musician, print maker, journalist and ceramicist. As well as telling the remarkable story of Gauguin's life, Januszczak also celebrates Gauguin's achievements and examines the various accusations of sexual misconduct, familial neglect and racism that are frequently made against him.\nThe film contains many of Gauguin's masterpieces and includes paintings put on show at the Hermitage in St Petersburg which haven't been seen in public since their disappearance during World War II.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1154 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.760\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2ch\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part 121.mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 1.09 GB\n * Subtitles: None\n * Source: DVB-Rip\n * Ripped by: artistharry\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gauguin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf44e5a8c869ee15d58fff40570d1a216e0b6f8","amp;dn":"BBC.Gauguin.The.Full.Story.PDTV.XviD.MP3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf44e5a8c869ee15d58fff40570d1a216e0b6f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,244,78,90,140,134,158,225,93,88,255,244,5,112,209,162,22,224,182,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
