The band are based in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. Their dÃƒÂ©but album Ã¢â‚¬ËœOvergrown' was released worldwide on Poco Poco Records on November 1st 2010. The album was produced, mixed and mastered by Shane Bowler. The pair describe their music lovingly as Ã¢â‚¬Å“drenched in dream-like soundscapes, and luscious melodies and imagery&quot; Their understated description is humbled by the adoring reviews and comments received from Radio and Paper Reviews.\n\nThe pair first met in January 2005 on a site-specific arts project in a derelict tobacco factory in Liverpool. The project was in conjunction with the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA) where they both studied. Throughout their studies and after graduating they continued to collaborate on various projects and perused careers in their respective fields.\nPaula Walker began her career as a professional dancer touring internationally with hit percussion show 'Noise Ensemble', headlining Henley Festival and working with Luc Petit (Director of Cirque Du Soleil). After enjoying a successful career in dance, Paula then moved into music and joined Adam Pickering to form The Daydream Club. Her melodious vocals added rich layers to Adam's musical soundscapes.\nAdam Pickering, a multi-instrumentalist (keys, drums, guitar, bass, percussion, melodica) and veteran of the band circuit, has supported the likes of Sam Sparro, The Wombats, Sneaky Sound System, Tinchy Stryder, DJ Yoda and Felix B from Basement Jaxx. Adam began his career as a keys player in Electronic outfit Mongo lounge. After touring venues around the UK (including the prestigious Chibuku Shake Shake in Liverpool and London, Lake of Stars Music Festival in Malawi, Africa and AB+ Club in Turin, Italy) they decided to relocate to Sweden to continue their creative journey in inspiring rural surroundings. After relatively little success following the move, Adam decided to move back to the UK with a refreshed hunger and passion for the music scene. This led him to join electro pop band Defend Moscow at the end of 2007 as a drummer. Defend Moscow began to create a buzz, gaining positive reviews from the likes of NME and The Guardian, with their two 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ singles released on Kids records 'Die Tonight' and 'Manifesto'. During this time Adam was gaining respect for his remixes under the alias Lenny Picko, including: 'Warrior' Magic Wands, 'Manifesto' and 'Die Tonight' Defend Moscow and 'Something Golden' Le Corps Mince De FranÃƒÂ§oise. In 2008/9, through lack of funds, Defend Moscow called it a day and the band members dispersed to work on individual projects. With Adam Pickering once again living in Leicestershire he and Paula Walker collaborated again in 2009 to form The Daydream Club.\n\nOvergrown' was released on November 1 2010 on indie label Poco Poco Records. Recorded at George Street Studios in Northampton, the album was produced, mixed and mastered by Shane Bowler and the album artwork was designed by James Bagnall.\nThe premise behind 'Overgrown' was to strip everything back to the bare bones of a song aiming to highlight the arrangement that remains. It was this idea that led to the intimate acoustic affair which is The Daydream Club's dÃƒÂ©but release. Of the title record they say, &quot;Overgrown is about losing sight of where you want to be but continuing on blindly regardless.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8409ef19d29f154426b30428c127b3869a4cbed0","amp;dn":"The+Daydream+Club+-+Overgrown+%5B2010%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8409ef19d29f154426b30428c127b3869a4cbed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,9,239,25,210,159,21,68,38,179,4,40,193,39,179,134,154,76,190,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
