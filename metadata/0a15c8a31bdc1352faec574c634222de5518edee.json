A world of classic rock'n'roll opened up in a time when you saw more hair metal bands and synth duos than duck-walks\n \nBut in the industrial town GÃƒÂ¤vle a bunch of teenagers sat mesmerized by the record players and searched their way back in time. To Chuck Berry and the legendary Chess studio in Chicago. To Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and of course Elvis Presley, who all recorded their first records in Memphis' classic Sun Studios.\n \nIn 1989 they formed The Refreshments and they haven't looked back since. After almost a quarter of a century, sales of more than half a million albums and 3 500+ shows, they have without doubt earned the title as Sweden's hardest working and most rootsy rock'n'roll band several times over.\n \nBut it wouldn't be until January 2013 until a lifelong dream came true: to to travel to the USA and record a tribute album to their constant source of inspiration - Chuck Berry - in Sun Studios, the Mecka of rock history. It turned out to be a dizzifying experience for Joakim Arnell (vocals/bass), Johan 'J.B' Blohm (piano/vocals), Mats Forsberg (drums) and Jonas GÃƒÂ¶ransson (guitar).
