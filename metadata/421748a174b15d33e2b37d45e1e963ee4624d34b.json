This mechanism was personal military power.\n\n The &quot;Roman Revolution&quot; was the adaptation of the old oligarchy-ruled Italy to a transnational confederation with a globalized economy an a global and united military direction.\n\nMr Syme writed this book for the Oxford univertity press in 1939 in a clear decition to fight the then loud MussoliniÃ‚Â´s propaganda of a &quot;Empire&quot; being other thing than a tirany , and the accession of Augustus to total power other thing than a permanent military putsch.\n\nThe fact of Augustus being the most able and intelligent Politician Europe has ever seen in all history doesnÃ‚Â´t change the main developments: pluralistc politics was dead in the Mediterranean for 1500 years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:421748a174b15d33e2b37d45e1e963ee4624d34b","amp;dn":"The+Roman+Revolution+%2C+Syme+%28Oxford+1939%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"421748a174b15d33e2b37d45e1e963ee4624d34b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,23,72,161,116,177,93,51,226,179,125,69,225,233,99,238,70,36,211,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
