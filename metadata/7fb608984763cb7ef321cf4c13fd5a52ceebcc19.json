Add a text callout to explain clearly. Apply ready-made objects from the menus...and your picture is worth 1,000 more words!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Look like a pro. Make your screenshot pop with a drop shadow. Give it perspective, spotlight an area, or add other nifty effects.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Convey complex ideas simply. Combine multiple images, callouts, shapes, and clip art stamps into a rich and detailed information graphic.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Have fun! Add a speech balloon to that photo of your cat.\n\nShare - send captures where they need to go...instantly!\nYes, you can save your captures in all the commonÃ¢â‚¬â€and a few uncommonÃ¢â‚¬â€image formats. But with SnagIt's free output accessories you can do so much more!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Collaborate in a flash. Click a button to send a screen capture by email, AIM, or Skype.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Be social.

SnagIt stores every capture automatically and keeps the most recent visible. A huge timesaver!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Find your stuff. Whether or not you saved it, find that capture later with the new visual search pane. Remember just one detailÃ¢â‚¬â€like the approximate date or the Web site you capturedÃ¢â‚¬â€and find your capture instantly.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Get organized (if you want to). As you capture images for next month's big project, tag them with &quot;big project&quot; or set the &quot;Important&quot; flag.
