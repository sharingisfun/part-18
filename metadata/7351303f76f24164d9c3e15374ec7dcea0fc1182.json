And by Ã¢â‚¬Å“the goodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ we mostly mean thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a character named Tor in it. Seriously, at this point the Venn diagram of Ã¢â‚¬Å“movies featuring a character or actor named TorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“movies we have riffedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ must be approaching a perfect circle. Why does this keep happening? We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know, but you can be sure an insane scientist in some B movie is hard at work on the answer, and that his name is Tor!\n\nThis particular Tor lives at a lake called Tenkiller, where his hobbies include boat maintenance, wearing upsettingly tiny shorts, and purifying the world of unclean people with murder. Oh, that Tor! He works with Preacher, an old creep whose voice seems to have been dubbed in a bathroom stall by a sleepy hillbilly. When two cute college coeds show up at the lake to get away from an overbearing boyfriend, and the fact that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re somehow roommates despite a 15 year age difference, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for terror! And phone calls. And long conversations about restaurant management. And naps. And people waking up from naps. And peaceful walks to the dock. But mostly, the first thing! What was it again? Oh yeah, TERROR!\n\nJoin Mike, Kevin, Bill, and Tor for a relaxing spa murder weekend to Terror at Tenkiller!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7351303f76f24164d9c3e15374ec7dcea0fc1182","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Terror+At+Tenkiller.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7351303f76f24164d9c3e15374ec7dcea0fc1182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,81,48,63,118,242,65,100,217,195,225,83,116,236,125,206,160,252,17,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
