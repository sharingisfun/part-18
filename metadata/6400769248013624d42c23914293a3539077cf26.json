It was recorded following studio sessions that materialized on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big FunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get Up With ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“On the CornerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn terms of repertoire, the material from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get Up With ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big FunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Tribute to Jack JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ each takes up a greater percentage of space than Ã¢â‚¬Å“On the CornerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but the hard-driving rhythms and plentiful effects make it clear which of Davis' fusion aesthetics applied. With the help of the wah-wah pedal, Miles shaped its sound as though it were some kind of abstract clay, moving closer to the most radical aspects of Jimi HendrixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar playing and more indebted to Sly and the Family Stone than to Charlie Parker. \n\nThe music is about power, rhythm, and the sum energy of the collective, and of Davis' electric jazz-rock albums, Ã¢â‚¬Å“In ConcertÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ does one of the most mind-bending jobs of living up to those ideals. \n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nIn Concert:\nRecorded Live at Philarmonic Hall\n\n1973\n\n\n 2CDs / 1997 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nDisc 1: &quot;FOOT FOOLER&quot; IN CONCERT, PARTS 1 &amp; 2:\n\n1.
