But the real surprise of the movie (and the CD) is that actress Michelle Pfeiffer does a credible job singing &quot;Makin' Whoopee&quot; and &quot;My Funny Valentine.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:857f6681a3dda72c37595021db3ad8348a2a053b","amp;dn":"The.Fabulous.Baker.Boys.Original.Motion.Picture.Soundtrack.128kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"857f6681a3dda72c37595021db3ad8348a2a053b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,127,102,129,163,221,167,44,55,89,80,33,219,58,216,52,138,42,5,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
