Any questions, just ask. It runs much faster than any Windows XP machine out there, and since OSX 10.4.1.1 (which came with the laptop) hasn't been updated in forever, you might like this. \n\nI suggest burning this to a DVD because it'll be much easier to install than from a USB. It's too big to go on a CD. \n\nThe live cd will boot just fine, but you need to add a boot parameter. (REMEMBER THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE!!!)\n\nwhen you see the boot: prompt, type in live video=radeonfb:1024x768-32@60 \n\nTo get wifi working, download http://mirror2.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-5.10.56.27.3_mipsel.tar.bz2 on an internet connected computer, and use a flash drive to throw it on the desktop. \n\nThen do type this in the terminal:\n\ncd Desktop\ntar xfvj broadcom-wl-5.10.56.27.3_mipsel.tar.bz2\nsudo b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware broadcom-wl-5.10.56.27.3/driver/wl_apsta/wl_prebuilt.o\n\n\nthen this to restart the wifi\n\nsudo modprobe -r b43 bcma\nsudo modprobe -r brcmsmac bcma\nsudo modprobe b43\n\n\n\nI did that so I could download updates while installing Lubuntu 13.04\n\n\nI'll help in any way I can if you want, but I'm just an everyday joe - not a programmer, not anything. I do development release testing though, which is basically my only experience.
