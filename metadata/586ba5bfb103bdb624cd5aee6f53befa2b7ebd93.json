For Daniel Shumski, it was: Will it Waffle? Hundreds of hours, countless messes, and 53 perfected recipes later, that answer is a resounding: Yes, it will! Steak? Yes! Pizza? Yes! Apple pie? Emphatically yes.\n\nAnd that's the beauty of being a waffle iron chefÃ¢â‚¬â€waffling food other than waffles is not just a novelty but an innovation that leads to a great end product, all while giving the cook the bonus pleasure of doing something cool, fun, and vaguely nerdy (or giving a reluctant eaterÃ¢â‚¬â€your child, sayÃ¢â‚¬â€a great reason to dig in). Waffled bacon reaches perfect crispness without burned edges, cooks super fast in the two-sided heat source, and leaves behind just the right amount of fat to waffle some eggs. Waffled Sweet Potato Gnocchi, Pressed Potato and Cheese Pierogi, and Waffled Meatballs all end up with dimples just right for trapping their delicious sauces. A waffle iron turns leftover mac 'n' cheese into Revitalized Macaroni and Cheese, which is like a decadent version of a grilled cheese sandwich with its golden, buttery, slightly crisp exterior and soft, melty, cheesy interior.\n\n\nBy Daniel Shumski\nPublished by Workman Publishing Company in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 225 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586ba5bfb103bdb624cd5aee6f53befa2b7ebd93","amp;dn":"Will+It+Waffle%3F+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586ba5bfb103bdb624cd5aee6f53befa2b7ebd93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,107,165,191,177,3,189,182,36,205,90,238,111,83,190,250,43,126,189,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
