Lowther\nPublisher: Praeger | ISBN: 0313353220 | 2008 | PDF | 252 pages\n\nDespite the growth of interest in the study of terrorism since 9/11, terrorism analysts rarely take a multidisciplinary approach to the subject. This leaves a number of terrorism's characteristics to be explored in new and unique ways. Terrorism's Unanswered Questions brings together scholars from the fields of criminology, international relations, law, political science, security studies, and sociology to answer several important questions where consensus has yet to be reached. Each chapter offers a new approach to the question asked that is both unique and challenges popular thought. The result is an original work appealing to a broad audience of scholars and students who desire to develop a better understanding of terrorism's characteristics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:801b64ae80ff2e7e4a70af7903fd25abb70ea2a3","amp;dn":"Terrorism%5C%27s+Unanswered+Questions+%282008%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"801b64ae80ff2e7e4a70af7903fd25abb70ea2a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,27,100,174,128,255,46,126,74,112,175,121,3,253,37,171,183,14,162,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
