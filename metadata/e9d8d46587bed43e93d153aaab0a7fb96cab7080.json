Her second Blue Note album extends Wilson's seductive pilgrimage beyond the conventions of jazz repertoire and accompaniment, yet it's her instincts as a jazz singer that inform these brilliant readings. The settings again step away from traditional small group jazz (for starters, there's no piano) to evoke the emotional core of these songs. Anyone who can turn the Monkees' &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot; into a slow-burning erotic vignette deserves your attention. ~ Sam Sutherland\n\nIf any one vocalist embodies the skills, styles, and creativity of the 21st-century jazz singer, it is Cassandra Wilson. Early on, Wilson aspired to sound like Betty Carter - &quot;to be Betty,&quot; she said in a 1996 JAZZIZ interview. But Carter implored Wilson to find her own way, and that she's done. Building upon the legacies of Carter and many other standard-bearing singers, yet focusing on her own personal influences, Wilson has achieved astonishing popular and critical success. ~ Jazziz\n\nWithout a doubt New moon Daughter is my favorite Cassandra Wilson album. Not to say that the others weren't also excellent. They definetely were. I still listen to Blue night til dawn and traveling miles regularly. But New moon daughter is something else entirely. It's not that New moon is totally different than any other Cassandra wilson album. It contains no less than five cover songs which are all excellent. Especially the quietly powerful strange fruit. She really adds another demension to that song. Her version of love is blindness is just as spellbinding as u2 original. I'm so lonesome I could cry is as heartbreaking as any other version that i've heard. And her rendition os The last train to clarksville makes you forget that a group called the monkees ever made such as song. And her version of harvest moon blew me away. But the true strength in New moon daughter are the original songs. Of those my favorites are solomons song and until, both songs are sung with an almost lovers intimacy. It feels as if she singing to you. :) Overall an excellent album that will please most if not all fans of Cassandra's Wilson's music. ~ &quot;williedynamite&quot;\n\nPersonnel:\nCassandra Wilson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, acoustic guitar\nCyro Baptista ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion, Jew's-Harp, shaker\nDougie Bowne ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion, drums, whistle, vibraphone\nGary Breit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hammond organ\nKevin Breit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic &amp; electric guitar, banjo, bouzouki\nBrandon Ross ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic &amp; electric guitar\nCharles Burnham ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ violin\nTony CedrasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ accordion\nGraham Haynes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ cornet\nLawrence &quot;Butch&quot; Morris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ cornet\nJeff Haynes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion, bongos\nPeepers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ background vocals\nMark Peterson, Lonnie Plaxico ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nGib Wharton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ pedal steel guitar\nChris Whitley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar on 1\n\nCassandra Wilson - New Moon Daughter Tracks:\n01  Strange Fruit    5:35   \n02  Love Is Blindness    4:56\n03  Solomon Sang    5:56   \n04  Death Letter    4:13\n05  Skylark    4:08   \n06  Find Him    4:39   \n07  I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry    4:51   \n08  Last Train To Clarksville    5:16   \n09  Until    6:30   \n10  A Little Warm Death    5:45   \n11  Memphis    5:05   \n12  Harvest Moon  5:01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9d8d46587bed43e93d153aaab0a7fb96cab7080","amp;dn":"Cassandra+Wilson+-+New+Moon+Daughter+%281995%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bscho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9d8d46587bed43e93d153aaab0a7fb96cab7080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,216,212,101,135,190,212,62,147,209,83,170,171,10,127,185,108,171,112,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
