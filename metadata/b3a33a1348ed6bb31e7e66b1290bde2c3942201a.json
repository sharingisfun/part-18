Once on the planet, he eludes his captors, risking his life and his chances of returning to Earth.

LewisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acclaimed Space Trilogy, which also includes Out of the Silent Planet and That Hideous Strength, Perelandra continues the adventures of the extraordinary Dr. Ransom. Pitted against the most destructive of human weaknesses, temptation, the great man must battle evil on a new planet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Perelandra ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ when it is invaded by a dark force. Will Perelandra succumb to this malevolent being, who strives to create a new world order and who must destroy an old and beautiful civilization to do so? Or will it throw off the yoke of corruption and achieve a spiritual perfection as yet unknown to man? The outcome of Dr. RansomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mighty struggle alone will determine the fate of this peace-loving planet.\n\n\nThat Hideous Strength [Book 3]\n\nThat Hideous Strength (subtitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-UpsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) is a 1945 novel by C.

Voyage to Venus) and once again feature the philologist Elwin Ransom. Yet, unlike the principal events of those two novels, the story takes place on Earth rather than in space or on other planets in the solar system.\n\n\nThe ebooks are also included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3a33a1348ed6bb31e7e66b1290bde2c3942201a","amp;dn":"C.S.+Lewis+-+Space+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3a33a1348ed6bb31e7e66b1290bde2c3942201a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,163,58,19,72,237,107,179,30,126,102,177,41,11,222,44,57,66,32,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
