Beginning with 1998's Wide Open Spaces, they struck a balance between the commercial, radio-ready aesthetic of country-pop and the rootsy sound of neo-traditionalist country, a combination that helped distinguish the trio from such concurrent stars as Shania Twain. The Dixie Chicks further distanced themselves from country's conservative boundaries as their career progressed, although their outspoken beliefs - specifically Natalie Maines' open criticism of the war in Iraq, which ignited a backlash in 2003 - were sometimes voiced to the detriment of the band's sales. Nevertheless, the Dixie Chicks remained a compelling band in concert and on record, boasting three-part harmonies and an instrumental prowess that was virtually unparalleled among similar groups.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.I Can Love You Better\n02.Wide Open Spaces\n03.Loving Arms\n04.There's Your Trouble\n05.You Were Mine\n06.Never Say Die\n07.Tonight The Heartache's On Me\n08.Let 'Er Rip\n09.Once You've Loved Somebody\n10.I'll Take Care Of You\n11.Am I The Only One (Who's Ever Felt This Way)\n12.Give It Up Or Let Me Go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n              ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4120cb438d0ef6d4d00ffc84d8fd94acc89ea252","amp;dn":"Dixie+Chicks+-+Wide+Open+Spaces+%281998%29+CBR320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4120cb438d0ef6d4d00ffc84d8fd94acc89ea252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,32,203,67,141,14,246,212,208,15,252,132,216,253,148,172,200,158,162,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
