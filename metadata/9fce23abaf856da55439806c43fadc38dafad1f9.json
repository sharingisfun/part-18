No fancy materials necessary: handyman Randy Stratton shows how to construct everything from common household goods. Build This Bong's 40 inventive projects made from melons, coconuts, snow-globes, teapots, and more are sure to be a big, mind-blowing hit.\nBiography\n\nRandy Stratton is, among other things, an illustrator, bookbinder, and metalsmith.
