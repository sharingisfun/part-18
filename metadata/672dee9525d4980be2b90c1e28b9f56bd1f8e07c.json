At the time the Justice League was featured in three separate series: Justice League America, Justice League Europe (JLE) and Justice League Quarterly (JLQ). Justice League Task Force was a spinoff of Justice League Europe, a series which ran from April 1989 to May 1993. Like JLE, this team carried a United Nations charter which sanctioned their activities. In fact, JLTF was comprised of several former JLE members. The team was called to action by Hannibal Martin, a representative of the U.N.. He asked that Martian Manhunter select a &quot;strike team&quot; of fellow Justice League members and to &quot;lead them on a very special mission&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:672dee9525d4980be2b90c1e28b9f56bd1f8e07c","amp;dn":"Justice+League+Task+Force","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"672dee9525d4980be2b90c1e28b9f56bd1f8e07c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,45,238,149,37,212,152,11,226,185,12,30,40,185,245,107,209,248,224,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
