Why are a quarter of a billion sperm cells needed to fertilize one egg? Are women really fertile for only a few days each month? How long should babies be breast-fed?\nIn How We Do It, primatologist Robert Martin draws on forty years of research to locate the roots of everything from our sex cells to the way we care for newborns. He examines the procreative history of humans as well as that of our primate kin to reveal whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really natural when it comes to making and raising babies, and distinguish which behaviors we ought to continueÃ¢â‚¬â€and which we should not. Although itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not realistic to raise our children like our ancestors did, MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation reveals surprising consequences ofÃ¢â‚¬â€and suggests ways to improve uponÃ¢â‚¬â€the way we do things now. For instance, he explains why choosing a midwife rather than an obstetrician may have a greater impact than we think on our birthing experience, examines the advantages of breast-feeding for both mothers and babies, and suggests why babies may be ready for toilet training far earlier than is commonly practiced.\nHow We Do It offers much-needed context for our reproductive and child-rearing practices, and shows that once we understand our evolutionary past, we can consider what worked, what didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and what it all means for the future of our species.\n\nAbout the Author\nRobert (&quot;Bob&quot;) Martin originally trained as a zoologist at the University of Oxford and followed this with a DPhil (Oxford's idiosyncratic label for &quot;PhD&quot;) a few years later. After a two-year spell of postdoctoral research at the General Ecology division of the MusÃƒÂ©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Brunoy, near Paris (France), he took up his first academic post on the faculty of University College London. During the 17 years that he spent in London, he also held posts as Senior Research Fellow at the Zoological Society of London, as Visiting Professor at Yale University and as Visiting Professor at the MusÃƒÂ©e de l'Homme, Paris. \nHe then spent fifteen years as director of the Anthropological Institute in ZÃƒÂ¼rich (Switzerland) before taking up an appointment at the Field Museum in Chicago. After serving as Provost there for five years, he took up his present appointment as A. Watson Armour III Curator of Biological Anthropology. He holds adjunct appointments at the University of Chicago as a member of the Committee on Evolutionary Biology and as professor in the Department of Anthropology. His list of publications now includes over 300 items, including the widely used 1990 textbook &quot;Primate Origins and Evolution&quot;. As a result of his academic travels, he is completely fluent in French and German.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction\nCHAPTER 1 Sperms and Eggs\nCHAPTER 2 Cycles and Seasons\nCHAPTER 3 From Mating to Conception\nCHAPTER 4 Long Pregnancies and Difficult Births\nCHAPTER 5 Growing a Large Brain\nCHAPTER 6 Feeding Babies: A Natural History of Breastfeeding\nCHAPTER 7 Baby Care: The Broader Picture\nCHAPTER 8 Monkeying with Human Reproduction\nAcknowledgments\nGJOSSaJy\nReferences\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:128d2399e9d4e31a12c3c119c33e2976501004b5","amp;dn":"How+We+Do+It+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"128d2399e9d4e31a12c3c119c33e2976501004b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,141,35,153,233,212,227,26,18,195,193,25,195,62,41,118,80,16,4,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
