The fierce fight to the finish begins with an appetizer basket of sardines and canned Sloppy Joe filling. Steaks are served up in the entree course, but the chefs' success with the other ingredients gives the judges much to think about. The final two chefs draw from family memories when they open up the last basket of the tournament and must grill some do-or-die desserts.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 19-Aug-2012 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cadd7108def11010cf3e74af543dc8834fb1e4f5","amp;dn":"Chopped.S12E16.Grill.Masters.Finale.HDTV.XviD-pwe.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cadd7108def11010cf3e74af543dc8834fb1e4f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,221,113,8,222,241,16,16,207,62,116,175,84,61,200,131,79,177,228,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
