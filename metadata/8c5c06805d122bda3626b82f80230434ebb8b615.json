Yet the relationship between dogs \nand humans remains a fascinating mystery, as no one really knows what \ngoes on in the canine mind. Now, in Inside of a Dog, Alexandra Horowitz \nfuses her perspectives as both scientist and dog owner to deliver a \nfresh look at the world of dogs---as seen from the animal's point of \nview. \n\nInspired by her years of living with her own dog, Pumpernickel, who \nwas a constant source of delight and mystery, Horowitz's mind became \nfilled with questions and ideas. In crisp, clear prose, she draws on \nher research in the field of dog cognition to give listeners a sense \nof a dog's perceptual and cognitive abilities---and paints a picture \nof what the canine experience is like. Horowitz's own scientific journey, \nand the insights she uncovered, allowed her to understand her dog better \nand appreciate her more. \n\nContaining up-to-the-minute research and providing many moments of dog \nbehavior recognition, this lively and absorbing book helps dog owners \nto see their best friend's behavior in a different and revealing light, \nallowing them to understand their pets and enjoy their company even \nmore.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c5c06805d122bda3626b82f80230434ebb8b615","amp;dn":"Alexandra+Horowitz+-+Inside+of+a+Dog+-+Nonfiction+Bestseller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c5c06805d122bda3626b82f80230434ebb8b615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,92,6,128,93,18,43,218,54,38,184,47,128,35,4,52,235,184,182,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
