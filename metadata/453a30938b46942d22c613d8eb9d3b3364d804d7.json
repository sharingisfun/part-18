It contains a selection of B-sides and remixes of previous singles. The album reached #57 in the UK, making it Steps' lowest-selling album release.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By John Galilee - After the sudden acrimonious demise of Steps at the end of 2001, the mourning for the fab five was remarkably short. The Last Dance is an attempt to stop the memory of the group being castigated to some pop trash can forever--a collection of B-sides and rare / unreleased material to remind many of their glory. Opening with a very dodgy orchestral hits medley, and the weak &quot;Too Busy Thinking About My Baby&quot;, the collection however soon gathers momentum. B-side &quot;Just Like The First Time&quot; is by far the best moment of the compilation and begs the age-old question of why it was never as a single. Previously unreleased &quot;Human Touch&quot; and the Geri Halliwell meets Atomic Kitten style &quot;Mars &amp; Venus&quot; are worth some added attention too. The Bonus CD is crammed with hot W.I.P. mixes, including an excellent, previously unreleased techno remix of their debut smash &quot;5,6,7,8&quot;. Fans will adore this collection but if you want a reminder of (or an introduction to) their pop greatness choose Steps Gold.\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Overture\n[02] Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\n[03] To Be Your Hero\n[04] Baby Don't Dance (W.I.P.
