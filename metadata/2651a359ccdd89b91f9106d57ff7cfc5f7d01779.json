The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics are written and sung by Peter Silberman. Their music is composed and performed by Silberman, Darby Cicci (trumpet, upright/electric bass, keyboards, synths, vocals) and Michael Lerner (drums). The AntlersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ makeup has developed from a lo-fi, bedroom recording folk project into a heavily lush and orchestrated rock group with an aptitude for melodious experimentation and layering. The instrumentation consists of vocals, electric guitar, keyboards/synths, drums and an array of other instruments including piano, horns, strings, and electronic elements.[1] Silberman has said that the band's name is taken from The Microphones' song, &quot;Antlers&quot;.\n\nReview:\nThe term Ã¢â‚¬Å“achingly beautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is such a go-to phrase in cultural criticism that there is even a Twitter account dedicated to pointing out its overuse. As clichÃƒÂ© as it is, Ã¢â‚¬Å“achingly beautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seems fundamental in describing the songs of a band like the Antlers. The trioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music is sometimes so personal and so graceful that it can be heartrending to listen to. That the Antlers have made significant stylistic leaps with each release, from 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Hospice to 2011Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Burst Apart and to new album Familiars, while never once failing a sense of blistering elegance is hugely impressive. Familiars is perhaps the AntlersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most affirmative release, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also their most complex to date, filled with moments of profundity and reflection. To some, its lack of immediacy may make Familiars feel as out of time as reading verse poetry by a stream, but listeners who remain patient will likely end up enlightened and fulfilled.\n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first song and lead single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“PalaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, eases the listener into the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world. The song feels like a direct outgrowth of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2012 EP, Undersea, with its slowly unfolding power, but it soon becomes apparent that Familiars is going to be a much jazzier ordeal. Although synthesizers and keyboards have a presence on all of the songs, they have taken a backseat to multi-instrumentalist Darby CicciÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trumpet, a gamble that pays off nicely. The emphasis on soulful brass, as well as a couple of frontman Peter SilbermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sparkling clean guitar lines, imbue the songs with a throwback quality while still feeling present, a move which lends very nicely to FamiliarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ theme of entering into a conversation with an embodiment of you that has experienced your past as well as your future. FamiliarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ second track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DoppelgangerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, serves as a fine example of the level the Antlers are working on here. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another deliberately paced song, gray and smoky in the places where Ã¢â‚¬Å“PalaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is light. Most startling is SilbermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choice of briefly abandoning his falsetto for a much lower, crawling, register that still holds a lot of drama.\n\nIn general, SilbermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are one of FamiliarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ greatest assets, with his varied deliveries benefiting each songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story and never overpowering the arrangements. With songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“RevisitedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SurrenderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“RefugeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ almost adopting melody lines similar to those of old standards, it would be so easy for a lesser singer to do variations on crooning for nine songs, but SilbermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing is far too heartfelt for that nonsense. It would likewise be easy to describe his singing as operatic or theatrical, but all vocal decisions feel as though they are coming from a pure, uncalculated place.\n\nLikewise, songs that require a more uplifting angle are filled with a naturalism which makes the happiness feel hard-earned and sincere. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParadeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is perhaps the most immediate moment on Familiars. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bittersweet and optimistic and brassy all at once, and all the emotions it evokes and the images it conjures have yet to cheapen with repeat listens (and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve easily listened to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParadeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ 20 or so times by now). ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to really describe its triumph out of context, as the three tracks which precede it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IntrudersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DirectorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“RevisitedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, make up the Ã¢â‚¬Å“heavy emotionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ portion of Familiars. Despite its bobbing rhythms, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IntrudersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the lines, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll beg for answers to all my questions / like, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwhat happenedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are presented so baldly, you may feel a small corner of your heart breaking and crumbling. Ã¢â‚¬Å“DirectorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has the cinematic atmospherics its title requires, with a climax that gives a sensation of Silberman calling out to his other self in the fog. Ã¢â‚¬Å“RevisitedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is funereal, but has another nice build and, again, its solemnity makes Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParadeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€as well as closing tracks Ã¢â‚¬Å“SurrenderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“RefugeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€shine all the more.\n\nAfter listening to Familiars for two weeks straight, I spent a week away from it to see how its appeal held up after emotional investments faded. The ability to become lost in Familiars had only grown in that time, something which bodes well for both its running as one of 2014Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s strongest releases and my argument that the album rewards patient listening. However, it also means that a silly catchall such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“achingly beautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, or even saying the AntlersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ music is deliberate and sad, threatens to box in compositions that are far more versatile than those terms suggest. So, if you listen to FamiliarsÃ¢â‚¬â€and you probably should because it is very greatÃ¢â‚¬â€it is crucial to do so with an open heart and an open head. Your reaction may not be as strong as mine, but your feelings will have benefited all the same.\nReview by Maria Schurr \nRate 9/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01. Palace (5:36)\n02.
