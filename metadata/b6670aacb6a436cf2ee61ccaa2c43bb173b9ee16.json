Well, all innocence is once again re-lost as cerebral raunch-teur, Andy Andrist, awakens these repressed feelings of misguided-guilt-ridden-joy with overwhelmingly filth-ridden exorbitance on Stand Up! Records latest release &quot;Dumb It Down For The Masses.&quot; Andrist offers the world an easy way to enjoy life and solve all of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s problems all in one CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ by dumbing it downÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and drinkingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a lot. Andrist invites his audience into a world of booze induced activities where real anarchy lives and retarded people are brought along for the fun of it and not just for a handicapped parking spot and purposes of political correctness. And, even though this CD in itself is a gift to society, make sure you stick around for the exclusive bonus track where Andrist imparts his priceless wisdom about gays and God onto an audience of QuakersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ seriously. And just like when you were left home alone for the first time, after listening to &quot;Dumb It Down For The Masses,&quot; you might have to watch Sesame Street and force yourself to cry in order to regain your sweet childhood innocence and look your parents in the eye.\n\nAndy Andrist - 01 - Intro by Doug\nAndy Andrist - 02 - Dumb it Down\nAndy Andrist - 03 - Special Olympics\nAndy Andrist - 04 - Handicapped Parking\nAndy Andrist - 05 - Queer Rights\nAndy Andrist - 06 - War on the Homeless\nAndy Andrist - 07 - Killers for Hire\nAndy Andrist - 08 - Coon Hunter\nAndy Andrist - 09 - Death\nAndy Andrist - 10 - The Carnival\nAndy Andrist - 11 - Too Many Erections\nAndy Andrist - 12 - Earth First\nAndy Andrist - 13 - Tragedy Channel\nAndy Andrist - 14 - Wal-Mart Sucks\nAndy Andrist - 15 - Hidden Track","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6670aacb6a436cf2ee61ccaa2c43bb173b9ee16","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Andy+Andrist+-+Dumb+It+Down+For+The+Masses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6670aacb6a436cf2ee61ccaa2c43bb173b9ee16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,103,10,172,182,164,54,207,46,230,28,202,162,196,59,177,115,185,238,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
