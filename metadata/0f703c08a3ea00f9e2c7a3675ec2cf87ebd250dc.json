If a political ruler were to tell us who to marry, what to learn, and which job to take, we would rebel against such tyrannical intrusions on our freedoms. If the government were to tell us what to read, want to watch and what to listen to, we would justifiably cry Ã¢â‚¬Å“censorshipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and lead the charge against such mind control.\nHow can we reconcile this contradiction? Is being Ã¢â‚¬Å“without rulersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ good, or bad? How can we fear something so terribly, while at the same time treasuring it so mightily?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Everyday AnarchyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ addresses this challenge head-on, arguing that being free of rulers is not something to fear - personally or politically - but rather a goal that we must constantly strive towards.\n\nAbout the author:\nStefan Molyneux is a Canadian philosopher, author, speaker, and host of Freedomain Radio.
