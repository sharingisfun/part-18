Taking what he wants has always worked well in the past and he sees no reason to alter his strategy. Monique Vasco appeals to him in every way that counts and she is an organic vampire, the necessary qualifications for becoming his mate.\n\nMonique reluctantly agrees to help her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ally introduce his sons to the expectations of modern society. After three hundred years of seclusion, Zoltan clan has a lot to learn. The oldest son, Anthony, is arrogant and domineering, but his brooding good looks and sensual appeal tempt her away from her planned activities. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to remember what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to accomplish every time she looks into his smoldering eyes.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cde724b09d4e8ab7a8dda13f48be2a7a1216e6","amp;dn":"Aubrey+Ross+-+Dangerous+LittleFairyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cde724b09d4e8ab7a8dda13f48be2a7a1216e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,205,231,36,176,157,78,138,183,168,221,161,63,72,190,42,122,18,22,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
