They include Greg Chaitin, mathematician at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center, New York, and Roger Penrose. \n\nDangerous Knowledge tackles some of the profound questions about the true nature of reality that mathematical thinkers are still trying to answer today.\n\n\nsee notes below:1 documentary, only split for technical reasons. broadcast in 1, watch in 1, get both parts, don&amp;#039;t start to watch pt2 before pt1.\n\nPart 1: God&amp;#039;s messenger\nThe film begins with Georg Cantor, the great mathematician whose work proved to be the foundation for much of the 20th-century mathematics. He believed he was God&amp;#039;s messenger and was eventually driven insane trying to prove his theories of infinity. \n\nLudwig Boltzmann&amp;#039;s struggle to prove the existence of atoms and probability eventually drove him to suicide.\n\n\nPart 2: The Enigma\nKurt G?del, the introverted confidant of Einstein, proved that there would always be problems which were outside human logic. His life ended in a sanatorium where he starved himself to death. \n\nFinally, Alan Turing, the great Bletchley Park code breaker, father of computer science and homosexual, died trying to prove that some things are fundamentally unprovable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nGSpot v2.70a avi file details:\n------------------------------\nFilename.....:\nFilesize.....: 585,075,498 bytes (2 parts of 560MB each)\nRuntime......: 44:43.000 (67075 frames)\n\nVideo Codec..: XviD ISO MPEG-4 (B-VOP//)\nVideo Bitrate: 1603 kbps\nAspect Ratio.: 672x384 (1.750)\nFramerate....: 25.000 fps\nBitstream....: Unpacked\n\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 127kbps 2ch VBR 48000Hz\nLanguage.....: English\n\nRelease Notes\n\nBecause I don&amp;#039;t rls files over 1024MB because my standalone doesn&amp;#039;t like them, I split this doc.\nAlthough it covers 4 parts with titles at each start (see screenshots), there wasn&amp;#039;t a nice place to cut right there, so I ended up cutting on a fade-out/in without any music, which happened to be right in the middle as well. It&amp;#039;s near the end of Boltzman&amp;#039;s section. Result is 2 files of 560MB, which are 1/8th dvd size.\n\nRelated Documentaries\nAbsolute Zero [1] [2] [3] \nAtom [1] [2] \nElegant Universe [1] [2] [3]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3fd1ba319213e395319105da985b7878b29a58a","amp;dn":"BBC+Dangerous+Knowledge+2of2+2007+DVBC+XviD+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3fd1ba319213e395319105da985b7878b29a58a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,253,27,163,25,33,62,57,83,25,16,93,169,133,183,135,139,41,165,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
