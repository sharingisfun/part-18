Put together from YIFY BRrip and director commentary from some guy on 4chan. For all the folks from the world who didn't get it with their Blu Ray ;)\n\n\nThe commentary is in .ogg; just play it with VLC, it will work. The original (English) track is also included in the mkv.\n\n\nThe commentary is few milliseconds off in the beginning (before the main title), I am too lazy to fix that since it doesn't really matter, it is OK after the main title.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1008b22decb24fcba3b2dddf96481bd3d98f96f4","amp;dn":"The+Avengers+%282012%29+720p+with+Director%27s+Commentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1008b22decb24fcba3b2dddf96481bd3d98f96f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,8,178,45,236,178,79,203,163,178,221,223,150,72,27,211,217,143,150,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
