Along with the activities and the exercises within the text, MathXLÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and MyMathLabÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® have been enhanced to create a better overall learning experience for the reader. Technology integrated throughout the text helps readers interpret real-life data algebraically, numerically, symbolically, and graphically. The active style of this book develops readersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mathematical literacy and builds a solid foundation for future study in mathematics and other disciplines.\nAbout the Author\nThe Consortium for Foundation Mathematics is a team of fourteen co-authors, primarily from the State University of New York and the City University of New York systems. Using the AMATYC Crossroads standards, the team developed an activity-based approach to mathematics in an effort to reach the large population of college students who, for whatever reason, have not yet succeeded in learning mathematics.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 792 pages\n    * Publisher: Addison Wesley; 4 edition (January 6, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0321698614\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0321698612\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e649c3045af9c0d162fd44011a4165a1f930c630","amp;dn":"Mathematics+in+Action%2C4th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e649c3045af9c0d162fd44011a4165a1f930c630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,73,195,4,90,249,192,209,98,253,68,1,26,65,101,161,249,48,198,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
