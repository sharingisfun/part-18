She dies before she can draw her first breath.\r\n\r\nOn that same cold and snowy night, Ursula Todd is born, lets out a lusty wail, and embarks upon a life that will be, to say the least, unusual. For as she grows, she also dies, repeatedly, in a variety of ways, while the young century marches on towards its second cataclysmic world war.\r\n\r\nDoes Ursula's apparently infinite number of lives give her the power to save the world from its inevitable destiny? And if she can â€” will she?\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Fenella Woolgar\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1e39ec4dbfbcbc8d8c69e63cb86026e38a07c67","amp;dn":"Kate+Atkinson+-+Life+After+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1e39ec4dbfbcbc8d8c69e63cb86026e38a07c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,227,158,196,219,251,203,200,216,198,158,99,203,134,2,110,56,160,124,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
