Built For Comfort \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSchenker/Pattison Summit is a melding of musical super powers. On drums they enlisted help from one of rock's most well known drummers, Aynsley Dunbar (UFO, Journey, Starship, Whitesnake) before rounding out the line-up with power bassist Gunter Nezhoda (Pat Travers, Leslie West). Aptly titled &quot;The Endless Jam,&quot; this CD contains extended versions of classic Gamma, Trower, Montrose, Traffic, Free songs and others which showcase Schenker and Pattison at the top of their game.\n\nThe rhythm section is great...Aynsley Dunbar is the perfect timekeeper, Gunter on bass does a really good job. Davey Pattison is better on vocal than I expected. I'm just wondering why this was'nt called Schenker's Endless Jam. His solos are more than half the song. This is not typical for Michael, his solos are always within the framework of the piece. Hold on to your hat, Schenker is on Fire! This is without a doubt one of the best performances I have ever heard. It sounds like his leads were done live. His speed and tone are incredible, his melody and feel are unmatched. Check out &quot;Shapes of Things&quot; and &quot;I Got The Fire&quot; for speed. &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and &quot;Pearly Queen&quot; for his tone. &quot;A Whiter Shade&quot; and &quot;Theme For an Imaginary Western&quot; for his feel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73876de4e37ac64e6a98e9c30fc43a236dfc9648","amp;dn":"Michael+Schenker+-+%5C%27The+Endless+Jam%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73876de4e37ac64e6a98e9c30fc43a236dfc9648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,135,109,228,227,122,198,78,106,152,233,195,15,196,58,35,109,252,150,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
