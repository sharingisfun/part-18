The result is an intense EP which seamlessly combines these two musicans' own sounds and takes the listener on an impressive trip. Hardcore beats, metal riffs, growls, opera vocals, sub-basses, absurd samples, sudden breaks: all these and more are found in &quot;Maigre&quot;, not thrown aimlessly, but carefully wrought in an EP which might advance a whole music scene forward.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adnoiseam.net/store/igorrr-ruby-my-dear-maigre_p4758.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adnoiseam.net/store/igorrr-ruby-my-dear-maigre_p4758.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThanks to Piggsy Vanhorn! m/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f0b950e12a1aa1f561097284100043a415e0a5b","amp;dn":"Igorrr+%26amp%3B+Ruby+My+Dear+-+Maigre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f0b950e12a1aa1f561097284100043a415e0a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,11,149,14,18,161,170,31,86,16,151,40,65,0,4,58,65,94,10,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
