I translated it with Google translate page-by-page after 12 hours of work. I'm not sure is it readable enough because of small grammar/spelling machine translation errors. The book is outstanding, rare and important. As far as I know, no one translated it in English and published so far. I published this translation half year ago on small private ebook-learning tracker, but this book needs greater audience.\r\n\r\nPublisher: Rech (2003)\r\nISBN-10: 592680180X\r\nISBN-13: 978-5926801801","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593f57ffd70800b70acae1011de3472224ee768f","amp;dn":"Dotsenko+Psychology+of+manipulation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593f57ffd70800b70acae1011de3472224ee768f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,63,87,255,215,8,0,183,10,202,225,1,29,227,71,34,36,238,118,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
