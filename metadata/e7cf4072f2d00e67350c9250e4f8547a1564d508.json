Their music features a rare contribution to the genre, incorporating the use of a violin.\n\nWhere We Stand is the second album by American rock band Yellowcard. It was released in 1999 (and re-released in 2004 and 2005).\n\nBen Dobson (singer) and Todd Clary (guitarist) who left after this album had a lot to do with their sound of old. DobsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scruffy, rough-around-the-edges vocal approach gave this band some toughness that is quite different from their current incarnation. The lyrics are about rebellion and philosophy. It was released by Takeover Records, a label created by one of the band's guitarists, Ben Harper. It is currently out-of-print.\n\n   1. &quot;Lesson Learned&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n   2. &quot;Time Will Tell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n   3. &quot;Sue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n   4. &quot;April 20th&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n   5. &quot;Uphill Both Ways&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n   6. &quot;Kids&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n   7. &quot;Doesn't Matter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:54\n   8. &quot;Sorry Try Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:44\n   9. &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n  10. &quot;On the Brink&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:26\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7cf4072f2d00e67350c9250e4f8547a1564d508","amp;dn":"Yellowcard-+where+we+stand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7cf4072f2d00e67350c9250e4f8547a1564d508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,207,64,114,242,208,14,103,53,12,146,80,228,248,84,122,21,100,213,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
