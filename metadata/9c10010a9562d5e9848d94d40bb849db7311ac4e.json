Considered outlaws, the colonists are in permanent hiding.\n\nThey have developed friendship and cooperation with a local race of Ã¢â‚¬Å“mermenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who are equally at home on land or sea. But that race only took to the sea to escape a malevolent power that hunted them and killed them violently for sport Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Those Others.\n\nWith a global decline in the population and reach of Those Others, contacts are few and the humans have no direct knowlege of them. So it is a major surprise when Dalgard, a human scout on his coming-of-age expedition, along with his Ã¢â‚¬Å“knife-brotherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sssuri of the mermen, run into a party of Those Others who are bent on reclaiming hideous weaponries left behind in one of their abandoned citiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and find that they are being aided by new arrivals from Earth!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c10010a9562d5e9848d94d40bb849db7311ac4e","amp;dn":"Star+Born+by+Andre+Norton+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c10010a9562d5e9848d94d40bb849db7311ac4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,16,1,10,149,98,213,233,132,141,148,212,11,184,73,219,115,17,172,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
