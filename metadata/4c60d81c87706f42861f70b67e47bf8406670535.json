The band originally formed in 2007 as Inflikted but changed its name for legal reasons. The group's creation marked the end of a 10-year feud between the Cavalera brothers who founded Sepultura in the early 1980s.\n\nFollowing the brothers' falling out, Max had formed a new band, Soulfly, and Igor had recorded four studio albums with Sepultura before leaving the band in January 2006. In July 2006, Max received an unexpected call from his brother, and by the end of the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix, Arizona, to perform in a Soulfly show. Igor joined Soulfly in concert and performed two Sepultura songs. After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project, and Igor accepted. To complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and the Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier to play bass guitar. The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader in July 2007. Named after the band's original moniker, Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008.\n\nIn October 2009, Max told Noisecreep that he and his brother Igor have plans to work on a second Cavalera Conspiracy album together. The following month, Noisecreep spoke with Igor about a new Cavalera Conspiracy album. Igor said that he and Max are both busy with their main commitments, but &quot;We have some ideas of maybe doing a remix album of [Inflikted] and have people like Justice or SoulwaxÃ¢â‚¬â€even some dub artists that my brother likesÃ¢â‚¬â€remix the whole album,&quot; he says. &quot;But that's just an idea. It's nothing confirmed. But me and Max are talking about doing a new album in the future, but there's no pressure. There's nobody from the label or the agents trying to push us to do it as quick as possible.&quot;\n\nCavalera Conspiracy entered the studio in April 2010 to begin recording the follow-up to their 2008 debut album, Inflikted. In May 2010, the band finished recording with producer Logan Mader in co-production with Max. Cavalera Conspiracy recruited their touring bassist Johny Chow to play bass on the album, as former member Joe Duplantier was busy with Gojira's next album. Upon finished recordings, Roadrunner Records confirmed that the band's new album would not be released until early 2011.\n\nOn 16 November 2010, in an article on blabbermouth.net it was revealed that the band's second album would be titled Blunt Force Trauma, and would be released on 29 March 2011. A tracklist for the album was also revealed.\n\nPrior to the album's release, two songs were published by the band. The song &quot;Killing inside&quot; was released via the homepage of the band's label Roadrunner Records and the Cavalera Conspiracy newsletter. The download was only available from 7 February 2011 until 9 February 2011. The title track &quot;Blunt Force Trauma&quot; was released on 17 February 2011 as a stream via the Roadrunner Records homepage.\n\nIn a November 2012 concert in Belo Horizonte, original Sepultura lead guitarist Jairo Guedz joined the band (performing with Tony Campos on bass) to perform Troops of Doom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c60d81c87706f42861f70b67e47bf8406670535","amp;dn":"Cavalera+Conspiracy+-+Blunt+Force+Trauma+%28Special+Edition%29+320k+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c60d81c87706f42861f70b67e47bf8406670535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,96,216,28,135,112,111,66,134,31,112,182,126,71,191,132,6,103,5,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
