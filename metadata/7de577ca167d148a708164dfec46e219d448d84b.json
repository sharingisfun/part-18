That is the way of the people of Quill. Each year, all the thirteen-year-olds are labeled as Wanted, Necessary, or Unwanted. Wanteds get more schooling and train to join the Quillitary. Necessaries keep the farms running. Unwanteds are set for elimination.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard for Alex to leave behind his twin, Aaron, a Wanted, but he makes peace with his fateÃ¢â‚¬â€until he discovers that instead of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“death farm,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ what awaits him is a magical place called ArtimÃƒâ€°. There, Alex and his fellow Unwanteds are encouraged to cultivate their creative abilities and use them magically. Everything Alex has ever known changes before his eyes, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a wondrous transformation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de577ca167d148a708164dfec46e219d448d84b","amp;dn":"Lisa+McMann-The+Unwanteds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de577ca167d148a708164dfec46e219d448d84b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,229,119,202,22,125,20,138,112,129,100,223,236,70,226,25,212,72,216,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
