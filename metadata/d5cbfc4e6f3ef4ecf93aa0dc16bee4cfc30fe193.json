In this unique group, the dark voice of the great English folksinger June Tabor is framed and supported by the quietly adventurous arrangements and subtle improvisations of Iain Ballamy and Huw Warren. Warren has worked with Tabor for 25 years already and made important contributions to her albums. Ã¢â‚¬Å“His pianoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, The Guardian has observed, Ã¢â‚¬Å“has teased out the deeper autumnal colours in TaborÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s range.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The nature of their association in Quercus is different, however. This is very much a collaborative band. Together and from different vantage points singer, saxophonist and pianist explore the emotional core of the songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5cbfc4e6f3ef4ecf93aa0dc16bee4cfc30fe193","amp;dn":"Quercus%28+June+Tabor%2CIain+Ballamy%2CHuw+Warren%29+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5cbfc4e6f3ef4ecf93aa0dc16bee4cfc30fe193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,203,252,78,111,62,244,236,249,58,160,220,22,190,228,207,195,15,225,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
