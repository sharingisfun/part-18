Bolder than her 2009 Mercury Prize-nominated debut and cut with an effortless blend of defiance and sweetness, the ten-track collection stays true to Hannigans folksy roots while establishing a more expansive pop sound. Throughout it all, its her mercurial voice that dominates, a croon that can go from the whispery, back-of-the-throat moan of Jesse Sykes and Vashti Bunyan to the crystal-clear, goosebump-inducing rallying cries of Florence and the Machine and Sandy Denny in a heartbeat. Solid yet understated, its Hannigans obvious gift for melody, tasteful arrangements, and remarkably emotive elocution that keeps Passenger afloat, while the world schemes and churns beneath.\n\nReleased: Sept 20, 2011\nGenre: Folk\nStyle: Singer/Songwriter\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannles: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~880 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
