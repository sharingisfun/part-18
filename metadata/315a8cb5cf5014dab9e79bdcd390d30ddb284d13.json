Instead of a traditional infra-red laser, a blue laser is used for recording the pits\non the CD master that is needed for disc replication. The blue laser creates more precise pits,\nreducing distortion in the optical read-out process.\n\nBlu-spec CD format employs a more precise BD cutting machine, a master disc that is made from\nthe same smooth material as silicon wafers for chip manufacture, and a different recording layer\nmaterial for the master disc.\n\nA Blu-spec CD can be played on all CD players and does not require a blue laser to be read.\nThe same holds true for Blu-spec CD2 discs.\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Dead Or Alive\nAlbum: Youthquake\nGenre: Pop / Electronic / Dance / 80s\nSource: Blu Spec CD2\nAlbum Release Year: 1985 [2013 Blu Spec CD2]\nLabel: Sony Music Japan International\nBarcode: 4547366197730\nCatalog No: SICP-30206\nNumber of Tracks: 11\nTotal Duration: 50:10\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.3.1\nEncoding Bit Rate [FLAC]: 944 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME3.99r\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps [Constant Bit Rate]\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 [Stereo]\nAudio Quality: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags [FLAC]: VorbisComment\nAudio File ID Tags [MP3]: id3v2.3, id3v1\nIncluded Artwork: Front and back booklet, inlay and obi strip scans\nAdditional Files: Log, Cue, MD5, SFV, FFP, Txt, Foo dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 468 MB\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n01.
