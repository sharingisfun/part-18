It doesn't auto play so just mount in a virtual drive, open it and follow the instructions. I run EVDO internet at 400k upload so be patient and PLZ help seed when you get it. If I lose connection (and sometimes i do at full bandwith) I'll restart as soon as I can.\n\n\nSibelius is a scorewriter program, created by Sibelius Software for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and RISC OS.
