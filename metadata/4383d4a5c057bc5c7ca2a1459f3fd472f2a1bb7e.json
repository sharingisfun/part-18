But the real danger has only begun as FBI Special Agent John Kaiser warns Penn that Brody wasn't the true leader of the Double Eagles. The puppeteer who actually controls the terrorist group is a man far more fearsome: the chief of the state police's Criminal Investigations Bureau, Forrest Knox.\r\n\r\nThe only way Penn can save his father, Dr. Tom Cageâ€”who is fleeing a murder charge as well as corrupt cops bent on killing himâ€”is either to make a devil's bargain with Knox or destroy him. While Penn desperately pursues both options, Caitlin uncovers the real story behind a series of unsolved civil rights murders that may hold the key to the Double Eagles' downfall. The trail leads her deep into the past, into the black backwaters of the Mississippi River, to a secret killing ground used by slave owners and the Klan for over two hundred years . . . a place of terrifying evil known only as &quot;the bone tree.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4383d4a5c057bc5c7ca2a1459f3fd472f2a1bb7e","amp;dn":"Greg+Iles+-+The+Bone+Tree+%28Penn+Cage+%235%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4383d4a5c057bc5c7ca2a1459f3fd472f2a1bb7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,131,212,165,192,87,188,92,124,162,161,69,159,63,212,114,242,161,187,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
