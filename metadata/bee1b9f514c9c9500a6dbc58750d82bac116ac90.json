Ruining the fact of it being an 'album' and spoon feeding it for their promotional needs.\n\nSo simple have fun. Buy it. If you don't your a prick simples ;)\n\n@Hadouken\n\nThe album is already released in japan. If you don't want it to leak before it's release in england then why make a deal with WE7 to do just that.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bee1b9f514c9c9500a6dbc58750d82bac116ac90","amp;dn":"Hadouken%21+-+For+The+Masses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bee1b9f514c9c9500a6dbc58750d82bac116ac90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,225,185,245,20,201,201,80,10,109,188,88,117,13,130,186,193,22,172,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
