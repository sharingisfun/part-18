The familiar material are harmonies and melody\nfrom &quot;All The Things You Are&quot;, &quot;Lush Life&quot; and &quot;Duke Ellington's Sound Of Love&quot;,\nto name but a few.\n\nEvans is joined by Ricardo Gallo on piano, Tom Blancarte on bass and Kevin Shea\non drums. The music is incredibly complex. Themes change, tempos change, rhythms\nchange : and this several times within the same piece, and not at the same\nmoment, but sometimes in overlaying structures, demanding incredible skills (and\nconcentration!) from the musicians. The result is nice. Inventiveness abounds,\nthe music changes itself the whole time, like a kind of sonic caleidoscope: you\ncan't know what comes next, yet it follows logically and unpredictably from the\nprevious notes, all in the same frame and structural context. The creative\ndiscipline and musicianship are stellar.\n\nYet in the end, it gives me a little bit the same feeling as the later albums by\nthe Empty Cage Quartet, or some of Dave Douglas' music: the musical skills\ncombined with intellectual play with structure create a more distant feel than\nthe expressive and soulful straight from the heart jazz that gets my\npreference. It is musicians' music of a very high level.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:496d77a61a6deddb76883afe607fdd695a08ec4b","amp;dn":"Peter+Evans+Quartet+-+Live+in+Lisbon+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"496d77a61a6deddb76883afe607fdd695a08ec4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,109,119,166,26,109,237,219,118,136,58,254,96,127,221,105,90,8,236,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
