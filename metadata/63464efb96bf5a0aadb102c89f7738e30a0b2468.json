SimTown allows the player to construct a town consisting of streets, houses, businesses and parks and then control the people in it. SimTown was one of the many 'Sim' spin-offs at the time, and was targeted more towards children.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63464efb96bf5a0aadb102c89f7738e30a0b2468","amp;dn":"%5BOS2+-+eComStation%5D+Sim+Town","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63464efb96bf5a0aadb102c89f7738e30a0b2468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,70,78,251,150,191,90,10,173,177,2,200,159,119,56,227,10,11,36,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
