Instead, the all-acoustic album -- a combination of Tupelo originals and well-chosen traditional songs -- taps into the very essence of backwoods culture, its music rooted in the darkest corners of Appalachian life. An inescapable sense of dread grips this collection, from the large-scale threat depicted in the stunning rendition of the Louvin Brothers' &quot;The Great Atomic Power&quot; to the fatalism of the worker anthems &quot;Grindstone&quot; and &quot;Coalminers&quot;; even the character studies, including a revelatory &quot;Moonshiner,&quot; are relentlessly grim. A vivid glimpse at the harsh realities of rural existence, March 16-20, 1992 is a brilliant resurrection of a bygone era of American folk artistry.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 Grindstone\n02 Coalminers\n03 Wait Up\n04 Criminals\n05 Shaky Ground\n06 Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down\n07 Black Eye\n08 Moonshiner\n09 I Wish My Baby Was Born\n10 Atomic Power\n11 Lilli Schull\n12 Warfare\n13 Fatal Wound\n14 Sandusky\n15 Wipe The Clock\n16 Take My Word\n17 Grindstone (Longview Farm Acoustic Demo)\n18 Atomic Power (Longview Farm Acoustic Demo)\n19 I Wanna Be Your Dog (Longview Farm Acoustic Demo)\n20 Moonshiner (Live '93)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc04b82f7694103e2d803a26840bcefa27275dfc","amp;dn":"Uncle+Tupelo+-+1992+-+March+16-20%2C+1992++%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc04b82f7694103e2d803a26840bcefa27275dfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,4,184,47,118,148,16,62,45,128,58,38,132,11,206,250,39,39,93,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
