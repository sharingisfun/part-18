The instruction manual is included in the zip files. (Daggerfall is difficult to install but follow the instructions closely).\nI played Redguard on Windows 98 so please \n1. Find a windows 98 iso from somewhere(or you may still have your old cd, I don't.)\n2.Use some visualization software like Oracle VM virtualbox (its free, just google and download) \n3. Install win 98 inside the virtualware\n4. Mount Redguard CDs one by one (using Deamon Tools or Alcohol 120, Linux users try AcetonelISO) and install the game.\n\nLike my every release, all the games will work fine in Linux. Tested in Fedora 14\n\nForget not to\n1. say thanks\n2. more importantly, seed after you finish downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc5a17b0e92ba70c8fdaa21e73579345900bb446","amp;dn":"The+Elder+Scrolls+2+%2B+Expansions+%28Redguard+%2B+Battlespire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc5a17b0e92ba70c8fdaa21e73579345900bb446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,90,23,176,233,43,167,12,143,218,162,30,115,87,147,69,144,11,180,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
