This torrent includes Mage v2: The Hero Defined.\n\n\n\nMage (comics)\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n \nMage: The Hero Defined cover by Matt Wagner.Mage is an American superhero comic book written and illustrated by Matt Wagner. Three volumes, each of 15 issues are planned; as of 2006, two have been published.\n\nVolume one, The Hero Discovered, was published by Comico from 1984 to 1986. Despite advertisements saying that a sequel was &quot;coming soon&quot;, The Hero Defined did not appear until 1997, published by Image Comics (Comico had gone bankrupt in 1990, and it had taken some time for Wagner to regain the rights to the series). The third and final volume, The Hero Denied, is planned, but no firm publication schedule fixed.\n\nWagner wrote and drew both series, with Sam Kieth as inker for part of the first, and Jeromy Cox as colourist for the second.\n\nZack Snyder has been attached to a film adaptation from 2003.\n\nThe Hero Defined picks up Kevin&amp;#039;s adventures several years later as he fights supernatural menaces in the company of other heroes such as Kirby Hero and Joe Phat, among many others. Each hero he encounters is based on a genuine mythological character (Kirby as Hercules, Joe as Coyote) and comics professionals Wagner has collaborated with (Kirby as Bernie Mireault, Joe as Joe Matt). There is a new Mage this timeÃƒÂ¢??Mirth has disappeared, and Kevin is followed around by an old tramp called Wally Ut, who insists he is his new mentor. In the course of the story he learns that he has misunderstood his mission, meets his future wife, and is alienated from his fellow heroes. He also discovers that he represents more than one mythical character: he is also Gilgamesh, and Kirby is also Enkidu. The story is an allegory of Wagner&amp;#039;s time as writer of Grendel, where he was the head of a team of artists, and deals with his assumption of leadership and the arrogance that comes with that, the loss of that leadership when Grendel&amp;#039;s publisher went bust, and the balance between his personal and professional life. The chapter titles of The Hero Defined are from Macbeth, and Kevin&amp;#039;s wife and her siblings are heavily based on the Weird Sisters.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e909c8a7bc00da50ab6c4ddc7e94377c9646ec9","amp;dn":"Mage+v2+-+The+Hero+Defined","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e909c8a7bc00da50ab6c4ddc7e94377c9646ec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,144,156,138,123,192,13,165,10,182,196,221,199,233,67,119,201,100,110,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
