Mysterious shadow creatures infest the landscape, and have forced whatever was left of the previous civilization to abandon this world in hopes of starting over somewhere new. Unfortunately, their spaceship never left and has been stuck in orbit for who knows how long.\nYou were one of the lucky few that escaped, however now as luck would have it, your stasis pod has been ejected to save power for the thousands of other escapees still in orbit, and you're about to wake up in a very hostile environment. It will take some tinkering and scavenging to survive, but we know you can do its.\nThis is all fun right? Right!\n\n\nChange Log:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425583f1cccbbb4e7c18b2e55563e75cbb6f6fe9","amp;dn":"Darkout+v1.2.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425583f1cccbbb4e7c18b2e55563e75cbb6f6fe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,85,131,241,204,203,187,78,124,24,178,229,85,99,231,92,187,111,111,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
