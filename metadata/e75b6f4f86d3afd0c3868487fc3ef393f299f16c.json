With this new book you can:\r\n\r\n    read a passage from Scripture for each day\r\n    reflect on the beauty and importance of Catholic faith and practice\r\n    meditate on thought-provoking questions\r\n    find a unique and inspiring prayer for each day of Lent\r\n\r\nThese timely and inspirational words will help renew your enthusiasm for being Catholic, while encouraging you to delve more deeply into the spirituality of the lenten seasonâ€”a perfect companion for individual reading or for group study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview\r\n\r\nFor Lent, I chose to give up time consuminggames in order to spend more time on spiritual reading and prayer. I was glad to have Rediscover Lent in my 'to-be-read' basket ready and waiting for my use.\r\n\r\nRediscover Lent grabbed me from the Introduction; Kelly let the reader know that this Lenten devotional would be about the seven pillars of Catholic spirituality - exactly what I needed for Lent. The seven pillars are Confession, daily prayer, the Mass, the Bible, fasting, spiritual reading and the Rosary. Definitely serious stuff for serious consideration but presented in a non-threatening manner.\r\n\r\nEach day starts with the Readings for daily Mass although you will need to take out your Bible or as I did have them delivered to your email box each morning. The Sunday Readings are listed for all three cycles. There is then a page or two of reflection, followed by questions on which to meditate and a prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75b6f4f86d3afd0c3868487fc3ef393f299f16c","amp;dn":"Matthew+Kelly+-+Rediscover+Lent+%28EPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75b6f4f86d3afd0c3868487fc3ef393f299f16c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,91,111,79,134,211,175,208,195,134,132,135,252,62,243,147,242,153,241,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
