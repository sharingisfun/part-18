Forget the Olympics and consider, under PerelmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guidance, the ledger of inequities maintained by such supposedly harmless games.\n\nThey have provided a smokescreen for the forcible removal of Ã¢â‚¬ËœundesirablesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢; aided governments in the pursuit of racist agendas; affirmed the hypocrisy of drug-testing in an industry where doping is more an imperative than an aberration; and developed the pornographic hybrid that Perelman dubs Ã¢â‚¬ËœspornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a further twist in our corrupt obsession with the body.\n\nDrawing examples from the modern history of the international sporting event, Perelman argues that todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s colosseums, upheld as examples of Ã¢â‚¬ËœhealthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, have become the steamroller for a decadent age fixated on competition, fame and elitism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b6a88f393b839c6f6e61ccbd46d78a7bb61b488","amp;dn":"Barbaric+Sport%3A+A+Global+Plague","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b6a88f393b839c6f6e61ccbd46d78a7bb61b488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,106,136,243,147,184,57,198,246,230,28,203,212,109,120,167,187,97,180,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
