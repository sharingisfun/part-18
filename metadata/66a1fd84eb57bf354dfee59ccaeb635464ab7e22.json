A Las Vegas institution for ove five decades, his often risque stories are softened by his unique delivery. In the 80's HBO and premium cable service was &quot;the new thing.&quot; Concerned that 'giving away' his act on cable would hurt his business at live venues, Hackett was slow to agree. HBO courted Buddy for close to a year before the deal was struck and the date was set. Always a pioneer, the king of stand-up comedy performed before a live audience in a first-of-its-kind, Comedy Special for the cameras of HBO. The program was nominated for a Cable Ace Award.
