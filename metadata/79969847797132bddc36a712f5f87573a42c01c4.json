Discusses salvation in the Old Testament, today, and in the Great Tribulation.\nIn this work, you will see why &quot;rightly dividing the word of truth&quot; is the proper method of studying the Holy Scriptures. We call this type of studying an attempt to grasp &quot;Dispensational Truth&quot; - the truths that apply to different dispensations in the Bible. &quot;Differences&quot; divide people. Differences put division between people and things. Thus, &quot;differences&quot; divide scriptural passages (and sometimes verses, and even sentences) into separate, segregated units.\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79969847797132bddc36a712f5f87573a42c01c4","amp;dn":"How+To+Teach+Dispensational+Truth+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79969847797132bddc36a712f5f87573a42c01c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,150,152,71,121,113,50,189,220,54,167,18,245,248,117,115,164,44,1,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
