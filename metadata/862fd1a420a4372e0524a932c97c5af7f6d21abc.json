Their education was paid for by a mysterious anonymous donor, and the truth about their parentage is unknown. In fact their mother had been burnt at the stake as a witch. She had died cursing those whom she blamed for her fate, notably Judge Jeffreys, the powerful Lady De Winter and her henchman Thomas Renfield. Lady De Winter is so concerned about the curse that she decides it might be a good idea to destroy any children of this witch, and she believes that the two young nuns Kathleen and Margaret may be the witchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughters.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862fd1a420a4372e0524a932c97c5af7f6d21abc","amp;dn":"Les+Demons++%28141+min%29+English++Jess+Franco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862fd1a420a4372e0524a932c97c5af7f6d21abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,47,209,164,32,164,55,46,5,36,169,50,201,124,90,247,246,210,26,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
