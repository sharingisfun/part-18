The title song is a folk gospel number with much harmony singing (unusual for the Allmans), while &quot;True Gravity&quot; is a virtuoso instrumental that makes hair-pin turns between two chord blues rock vamps and skittering unison jazz riffs.\n\nAlthough guitarist Dickie Betts wrote or co-wrote most of the songs, the rest of the material here isn&amp;#039;t at all country-tinged. In fact, this is one of the band&amp;#039;s bluesiest albums ever, from the old-time boogie woogie of &quot;Let Me Ride,&quot; to &quot;Low Down Dirty Mean,&quot; which begins as minimalist acoustic country blues and ends as a full-bore assault by the entire band. Features Warren Haynes and Allen Woody who went on to form Gov&amp;#039;t Mule.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180c9034d87982b95f0c7d66a25852bcb92adbca","amp;dn":"Allman+Brothers+Band-Seven+Turns%281990%29320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180c9034d87982b95f0c7d66a25852bcb92adbca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,12,144,52,216,121,130,185,95,12,125,102,162,88,82,188,185,42,219,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
