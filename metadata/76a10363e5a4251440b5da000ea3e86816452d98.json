Fans and critics alike generally regard the album as an extremely important album in the history of rock music, citing the lasting influence it has had on subsequent punk rock musicians and other musical genres that were influenced by such punk rock artists. In 2003, Rolling Stone named it the forty-first greatest album of all time on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nThe album was released on 27 October 1977 through Virgin Records amid controversy arising from the use of the coarse slang word (in British English) &quot;bollocks&quot; in its title.\n\nOlder versions of most of the album's songs also appeared on a bootleg album called Spunk, which consists of demo recordings the band had made during 1976 and January 1977, and which was released shortly before Never Mind the Bollocks.\n\n\nReleased 27 October 1977 (UK)\n10 November 1977 (US)\nRecorded October 1976,\nMarch-June 1977,\nAugust 1977 at Wessex Sound Studios, London, England\nGenre Punk rock\nLength 38:45\nLabel Virgin (UK)\nWarner Bros.
