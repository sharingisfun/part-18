This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey replays the very first words ever recorded by the very first man ever to make a recording.\nWe hear the story of one artist who had 2 albums recalled by the US government, one because he released 400,000 copies, each of which contained a pair of women's panties.\nCasey gives the recipe for a margarita.\nIn the history of the pop singles chart, only 4 live recordings have ever made #1. One of them is in this countdown.\nOne singer is alive to be in the countdown only because he gave up his seat on the plane that crashed and killed Buddy Holly. Casey tells the story.\n&quot;Rumors&quot; by Fleetwood Mac seemed like it would stay at #1 on the album chart forever, &quot;Welcome Back Kotter&quot; was still on the air, and Pop Rocks had just been invented. This is a really good countdown from a great moment in time.\n \n40:    Handy Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ James Taylor\n39:    Telephone Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Electric Light Orchestra\n38:    DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gun Ã¢â‚¬â€œ C.J. &amp; Co        \n37:    Sir Duke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stevie Wonder     \n36:    The Killing of Georgie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rod Stewart     \n35:    Give A Little Bit - Supertramp    \n34:    Telephone Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Meri Wilson\n33:    Just a Song Before I Go Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash\n32:    Heard It in A Love Song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Marshall Tucker Band\n31:    Lonely Boy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Andrew Gold\n30:    Barracuda - Heart\n29:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Your Boogie Man - K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band    \n28:    Easy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Commodores\n27:    Luckenbach, Texas (Back To The Basics Of Love) - Waylon Jennings\n26:    ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sad To Belong Ã¢â‚¬â€œ England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n25:    Lucille Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Rogers\n24:    YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re My World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Helen Reddy\n23:    Feels Like the First Time - Foreigner\n22:    You Made Me Believe In Magic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bay City Rollers\n21:    Life in The Fast Lane Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Eagles\n20:    LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grown Deep Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Nolan\n19:    Knowing Me, Knowing You - Abba\n18:    High School Dance - Sylvers\n17:    You And Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alice Cooper\n16:    Whatcha Gonna Do Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pablo Cruise\n15:    Higher And Higher Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rita Coolidge\n14:    Best Of My Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Emotions\n13:    Dreams Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fleetwood Mac\n12:    Do You Wanna Make Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Mccann\n11:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m In You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Frampton\n10:    My Heart Belongs To Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barbra Streisand\n9:    Margaritaville Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jimmy Buffett\n8:    Jet Airliner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Steve Miller Band\n7:    Angel In Your Arms - Hot\n6:    Got To Give It Up (Part 1) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Marvin Gaye\n5:    I Just Want To Be Your Everything Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Andy Gibb\n4:    Gonna Fly Now (Theme from Ã¢â‚¬Å“RockyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bill Conti\n3:    Looks Like We Made It Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barry Manilow\n2:    Da Doo Ron Ron Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shaun Cassidy\n1:    Undercover Angel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alan OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Day\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42f19a9e70aa8c79b3b61ec7a5e68653a0d5d8a6","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_July_9th%2C_1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42f19a9e70aa8c79b3b61ec7a5e68653a0d5d8a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,241,154,158,112,170,140,121,179,182,30,199,165,230,134,83,160,213,216,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
