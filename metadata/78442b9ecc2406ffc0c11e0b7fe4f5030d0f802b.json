Fact is, however, these tapes have already been issuedâ€¦ a hundred different times, via a slew of cheapie, one-off labels and dozens of different titles (usually Acapulco Sunrise). Apparently someone besides CBS acquired the rights to these tapes decades ago and has licensed them to anyone, anywhere at any time. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ if theyâ€™re even licensed at all. \r\nTainted history aside, this set includes some great live jams, capturing the essence of one of Santanaâ€™s first incarnations â€“ almost all instrumental, with high-energy percussion fueled by a jazzy/ethnic flavoring. This particular disc is probably the most legit of the bunch, (supposedly) issued by Virgin Records in 1996 (via Sky Ranch, the then-owners of said recordings?). Note that there are some minor sound issues on a track or two. If you want a hard copy, there are dozens of options, that are, surprisingly, more expensive than youâ€™d expect â€“ on labels like Rolled Gold, Bellevue, Hallmark, Dark Peak, Noble Price, Prime Cuts and, of course, LaserLight, with titles like Acapulco Sunrise, La Puesta del Sol, Jingo, Jin-Go-Lo-Ba, Early Magic, and Evolution: The Original Recordings, just to name a few. Careful, song titles are inconsistent, so youâ€™ll need to look closely when dumpster diving for this long-ignored piece of rock history. \r\nAs for this Virgin/Sky Ranch disc, it appears to have a virtually non-existent profile, like it was never even released.
