This book clarifies to executives the decisions to be made on software security and then provides guidance to managers and developers on process and procedure. Readers are armed with firm solutions for the fight against cyber threats. Ã¢â‚¬â€Dr. Dena Haritos Tsamitis. Carnegie Mellon University In the wake of cloud computing and mobile apps, the issue of software security has never been more important than today. This book is a must read for security specialists, software developers and software engineers. The authors do a brilliant job providing common sense approaches to achieving a strong software security posture and should be part of every security professionalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s library . Ã¢â‚¬â€Dr. Larry Ponemon, Ponemon Institute Finally, the definitive how-to guide for software security professionals. Dr. Ransome, Anmol Misra, and Brook Schoenfield deftly outline the procedures and policies needed to integrate real security into the software development process. In an age of ubiquitous malware, this volume shows how inadequate traditional network security models are and why security needs to be software and developer-centric if it is to be relevant. A must-have for anyone on the front lines of the Cyber War - especially software developers and those who work with them. Ã¢â‚¬â€Cedric Leighton, Colonel, USAF (Ret.), Cedric Leighton Associates When it comes to software security, people usually think that the solution is to hire a security expert to help you fix a security issue or a hacker to identify vulnerabilities in the software. This is typically a stop gap and workaround. Neither of these addresses the root cause of software security. At its root, the cause lies within the source code developed by software developers. Therefore, security should be developer-centric, focused on the secure development of the source code. Dr. Ransome, Anmol Misra, and Brook Schoenfield give you a magic formula in this book - the methodology and process to build security into the entire software development life cycle so that the software is secured at the source! Ã¢â‚¬â€Eric S. Yuan. Zoom Video Communications About the Book: There is much publicity regarding network security, but the real cyber AchillesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ heel is insecure software. Millions of software vulnerabilities create a cyber house of cards, in which we conduct our digital lives. In response, security people build ever more elaborate cyber fortresses to protect this vulnerable software. Despite their efforts, cyber fortifications consistently fail to protect our digital treasures. Why? The security industry has failed to engage fully with the creative, innovative people who write software. Core Software Security expounds developer-centric software security, a holistic process to engage creativity for security. As long as software is developed by humans, it requires the human element to fix it. Developer-centric security is not only feasible but also cost effective and operationally relevant. The methodology builds security into software development, which lies at the heart of our cyber infrastructure. Whatever development method is employed, software must be secured at the source .
