You just install the game and\nplay it. That's it. No patching, no cracking and nothing\nis needed, just install and have fun. Now, this would\nsure be very nice to be just like that, HOWEVER there\ncan be a few minor problems, mentioned down below...\n\n\n[FAQ]\nQ1. Why did you create this collection?\n\nA1. All three episodes of Resident Evil have been\n\twritten to be run on Win95/98 and can be pretty\n\thard to install &amp; configre on modern systems.\n\t\n\t\nQ2. Resident Evil 1 crashes when playing Jill\n\tat the part, where the first zombie comes\n\tinto the dining room.\n\t\nA2. This is a common issue. The solution is that\n\tyou have to run back to the main hall twice,\n\tinstead of entering the hallway the first\n\tzombie is in. Other than this, the game is not\n\tsupposed to crash at any other part.\n\t\n\nQ3. Resident Evil 1 is too fast.\n\nA3. This is also a common issue. Nothing easy done\n\tcan be done about this. Live with it, or not.\n\t\n\t\nQ4. Resident EVil 1's backgrounds are not displayed\n\tproperly.\n\t\nA4. This game was designed to be ran on specific video\n\tcards. This should however not be an issue: run\n\tStart/RESIDENT EVIL Collection/Resident Evil\n\tVideo Setup and select another card. I for example\n\thave a GeForce4 MX440 SE 64MB video card and\n\tselecting a &quot;Rendition&quot; card works for me.\n\t\nQ5. Resident Evil 1's videos don't play.\n\nA5. Install a Cinepack codec, but you should be able\n\tto play it by default.\n\t\nQ6. Resident Evil 2's videos don't play.\n\nA6. Same as above, except this time you need the Indeo\n\tvideo codec. This is included with Resident Evil 2's\n\tinstaller. At the end of the installation, you are\n\tprompted to install it - do so. If you still can't\n\tplay it, you propably have K-Lite or another\n\tcodec pack installed and that is the cause.\n\t\nQ7. Resident Evil 2's backgrounds are not displayed\n\tcorrectly. \n\t\nA7.\tThis problem is similiar to the\n\tone mentioned in RE1's case - in the installer,\n\tI set the defaults to a setting that should work\n\twith most modern video cards - Rage Pro 3D.\n\tHowever if that doesn't work for you, go to\n\tStart/RESIDENT EVIL Collection/Resident Evil 2 Setup\n\tand select Options. Here you can try other settings.\n\t\nQ8. Saving/loading in Resident Evil 2 don't work.\n\nA8. Another common issue, but this can be solved.\n\tI made a little BAT file for this issue.\n\tRun it and follow the instructions.\n\tEnter the path:\n\t&quot;C:\\Program Files\\Resident EVil 2 save&quot;\n\ton 32-bit or\n\t&quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Resident EVil 2 save&quot;\n\ton 64-bit for example.\n\tThis will create the folder as well modify the\n\tregistry.\n\t\nENJOY!\n\nNote: I inclued the *.iss files, so everyone can see\n\t  that there's no shit included in the installers.\n\t  Consider it open source. :)\n\n-TURION\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e44de2e177296a15b38d5418c1d89e06761ec0ee","amp;dn":"Resident.Evil.1.2.3.Collection.%5BPC-DVD%5D-TURION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e44de2e177296a15b38d5418c1d89e06761ec0ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,77,226,225,119,41,106,21,179,141,84,24,193,216,158,6,118,30,192,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
