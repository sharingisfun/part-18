However, don't expect to find this superior version in the shops - only the poor (in my opinion) remixed version can be found there.\n\n\n1. Low Place Like Home\n2. Tesko Suicide\n3. 6 Underground\n4. Becoming X\n5. Spin Spin Sugar\n6. Post-Modern Sleaze\n7. Waterbaby\n8. Roll On\n9. Wasted Early Sunday Morning\n10. Walking Zero\n11. How Do\n\n\nNote: You can usually tell the &quot;bad&quot; version by it having a 12th track, but that's not always the case. Be careful when trying to get an original for your collection. The original 'Circuit Board' cover design was used on a later remixed release - I think they tried to fool people into buying it as the original one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8eb589130896cc855b6f2399bb033c1a6e27ff","amp;dn":"Sneaker+Pimps+-+Becoming+X+%28Original+1996%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8eb589130896cc855b6f2399bb033c1a6e27ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,142,181,137,19,8,150,204,133,91,111,35,153,187,3,60,26,110,39,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
