The two lovers were a Dutch sailor imprisoned there for sodomy and a young Khoi herder. The Khoi were part of the Hottentot tribal group and as such were the untouchables of that time. The two were placed on trial and this love affair and the legal battles are the grist of Greyson and Lewis' film based partly on court transcripts from the time. In South Africa, during the 1700s, sodomy was a crime deemed worse than murder, and the fact that these two young men had indulged in it was also complicated by the fact that this was an interracial love affair.\n\n\n01:43:04\n456x328\n29.97 FPS\n\n\nEnglish hard-coded sub.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e842e0e6cc271c6cf9d2f2878272e1d99a705e","amp;dn":"2003+Proteus+%28CAN-RSA%29+%5BEngHSub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e842e0e6cc271c6cf9d2f2878272e1d99a705e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,232,66,224,230,204,39,28,108,249,210,242,135,130,114,225,217,154,112,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
