He teaches dance classes all day, hits the clubs every night and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not looking for complicationsÃ¢â‚¬â€especially not in the form of overly-innocent swimmers who like to spy on him from across the street.\n\nThe first time Colby approaches him, Noah has no trouble turning him away. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only when Colby returns years later, to collect on a casually delivered promise, that Noah finds himself incapable of keeping Colby locked out of his carefully re-constructed life.\n\nTheir kinks may match up perfectly, but their lives and their pasts couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be more different. Years have passed, but will what they have together turn out to be worth waiting for?\nGenre: MM Romance, BDSM\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac80f5069c38851255323171ca496bfaf3d0719c","amp;dn":"Kim+Dare+-+FIT+Guys+1+-+Worth+Waiting+For.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac80f5069c38851255323171ca496bfaf3d0719c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,128,245,6,156,56,133,18,85,50,49,113,202,73,107,250,243,208,113,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
