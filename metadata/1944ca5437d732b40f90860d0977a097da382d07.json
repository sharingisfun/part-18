It was the lone album that Cilio ever released, and he took his own life in 1983, at the age of 33. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a casual assessment by OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Rourke, as it actually suggests the deep level of intimacy of CilioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound.\n\nThat reissue reinforced that closeness. Originally entitled Dialoghi Del Presente (translation Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dialogues of the PresentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) but retitled DellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Universo Assente (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Absent UniverseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), it looked like a blank white cover. Only when held in your hands and inspected closely did the near-invisible cover image appear, a hand-drawn spiral in light silver ink. That CD reissue quickly disappeared, but thankfully it now receives a wider reissue some ten years on, both on CD and vinyl from the meticulous Italian label, Die Schachtel.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to draw an exact parallel to CilioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Rourke triangulates it somewhere between Nick DrakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pink Moon, Bill FayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Time of the Last Persecution and the debut album from This Heat. But in its punctilious attention to acoustic instrumentation in space, DellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Universo Assente comes closest to approximating what the next Mark Hollis album might have sounded like, had Hollis continued along Laughing StockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and his 1998 self-titled albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trajectory, moving away from words and song, ever closer to a distilled sound couched in silence. The effect of CilioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music reminds me of Jess HarvellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s line in the above review, stating Ã¢â‚¬Å“how startling, isolated moments of sound, or a formless wash of sound, can wring emotions out of listeners as powerfully as any conventional melody.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1944ca5437d732b40f90860d0977a097da382d07","amp;dn":"Luciano+Cilio+-+Dell%26rsquo%3BUniverso+Assente","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1944ca5437d732b40f90860d0977a097da382d07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,68,202,84,55,215,50,180,15,144,134,13,9,119,160,151,218,56,45,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
