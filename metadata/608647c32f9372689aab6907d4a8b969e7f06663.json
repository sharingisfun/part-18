By focusing on classified secrets, the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to put information out of sight if it would harm national security, Secrecy explores the tensions between our safety as a nation, and our ability to function as a democracy. From extraordinary rendition to warrant-less wiretaps and Abu Ghraib, we have learned that, under the veil of classification, even our leaders can give in to dangerous impulses. Secrecy increasingly hides national policy, impedes coordination among agencies, bloats budgets and obscures foreign accords; secrecy throws into the dark our system of justice and derails the balance of power between the executive branch and the rest of government.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157709/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157709/&lt;/a&gt;\n\njoin us at moviefox.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:608647c32f9372689aab6907d4a8b969e7f06663","amp;dn":"Secrecy.2008.DVDRiP.XViD-MisFitZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"608647c32f9372689aab6907d4a8b969e7f06663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,134,71,195,47,147,114,104,154,171,105,7,212,168,185,105,231,240,102,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
