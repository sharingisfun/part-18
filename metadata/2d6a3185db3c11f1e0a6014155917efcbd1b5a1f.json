The Wurlitzer 125 Band Organ was a bit like a player piano on steroids.  They had pipes, drums, and perhaps a few other things as well.  They were fully automated, having no pedals, stops, or keyboards like a standard organ, but were controlled by rolls of punched paper, similar to a player piano.  They were used anywhere a showman wanted a lot of noise without the accompanying expense and trouble of a live band: carnivals, side shows, and of course, carousels.\n\nYou'll probably find yourself suffering from a debilitating case of listener's fatigue if you try to consume all of these tracks in one shot, but before you turn it off, skip ahead to the final track, &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot;.  It's a hoot to listen to and makes the CD well worth the price.\n\n1.  Chicken Reel\n2.  Gimme Dat Ding\n3.  Put Another Nickel In\n4.  Paddy Wac\n5.  Sugar Time\n6.  76 Trombones\n7.
