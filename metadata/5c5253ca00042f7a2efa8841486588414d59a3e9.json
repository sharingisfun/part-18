However, I&amp;#039;d seen that someone else\nhad already beaten me to it... but I&amp;#039;m still getting requests for it. After investigating further it looks\nlike the other torrent has stalled at around 85% with no more seeders, and my rip is a different file size\nso I can&amp;#039;t simply join that particular torrent.\n\nDVD box blurb...\nIn the underworld of the American Midwest two rival gangs, the Ravens and the Spiders, rule the streets.\nGoose, the leader of the Ravens, decides on one final drug deal before leaving the gang and settling down\nwith his psychic girlfriend. His life crumbles around him, however, when his girlfriend is brutally clubbed\nto death by members of the rival gang. After burying her in a trash compactor, Goose hides out with his\npsycho junkie father and plots his revenge! His rampage culminates in a massive street brawl with kung-fu,\ngory decapitations, vivid throat slashings, car stunts and bloody gunfights.\nThis action-packed cult classic is considered by many as a masterwork of independent filmmaking and Synapse\nFilms is proud to present this film in a digitally re-mastered DVD edition.\n\nIf you enjoy this, make sure you check out my other Jim Van Bebber torrents!
