The film stars Charles Bronson, Ursula Andress, ToshirÃƒÂ´ Mifune, Alain Delon and Capucine. It has also been released under the title: Red Sun. \n\nEast is East and West is West, but the twain meet in this actionful oater with Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune matching sword and wits with Yank Charles Bronson and Frenchman Alain Delon.\n\nMifune is a Samurai accompanying the Japanese ambassador in a trek across the West to Washington in the mid-19th century to deliver a jeweled, golden sword to the US president. On the way the train is held up by Bronson and Delon, but the latter double-crosses Bronson and also kills a samurai friend of Mifune and takes the sword. MifuneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s code requires he find the sword and kill Delon.\n\nMifune is his towering, glowering self in his rich samurai garb and his sword matches the guns. Bronson is relaxed and effective as the bandit with some honor within his own life. Ursula Andress is decorative as the wily prostie, out to make a killing to get out of her life of bondage.\n\nIn what was billed as &quot;The First East-Meets-West Western,&quot; Toshiro Mifune plays Kuroda, a samurai warrior who accompanies a Japanese diplomat to the United States. The diplomat has brought with him a golden, jewel-encrusted sword to present as a token of good will to the president, but as they travel by train through the west, they're ambushed by a pair of outlaws, Gauche (Alain Delon) and Link (Charles Bronson). Gauche and Link steal the sword, but Link leans the hard way about his partner's trustworthiness when Gauche double-crosses him and makes off with the booty. Since both Kuroda and Link have a grudge against Gauche, they warily join forces to track him down and return the sword to its rightful owner. Along the way, they have to deal with cultural conflict, Indian attacks, and encounters with beautiful women (played by Capucine and Ursula Andress). Given its cast and theme, Red Sun was predictably enough a major box-office success in Europe and Japan, but it passed through with little notice in the United States,Bronson had to wait another 4 years for Death Wish to made him a major star in the USA.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 3.04gb\nDuration.... 01:54:29\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 1280\nFrame Height.... 688\nData Rate.... 3560kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 236kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample\nEnglish Audio Track 1,French Track 2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a18b4a2098bb1ddfc3081c104be3a20244c05b0","amp;dn":"Soleil+rouge+aka+Red+Sun+1971+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a18b4a2098bb1ddfc3081c104be3a20244c05b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,24,180,162,9,139,177,221,252,48,129,193,4,190,58,32,36,76,5,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
