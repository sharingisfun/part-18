But arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the wacky ones the most fun?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ee0eb34a972d3873a5d48914d8c0059c3bf5c3e","amp;dn":"Southern+Tenant+Folk+Union+-+Hello+Cold+Goodbye+Sun+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Cl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ee0eb34a972d3873a5d48914d8c0059c3bf5c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,224,235,52,169,114,211,135,58,93,72,145,77,140,0,89,195,191,92,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
