The Dukes are a family who were once moonshiners but when cousins Bo and Luke were caught; they were given probation on the condition that they give up moon shining, which they did. Now every now and then they learn that J.D. Hogg who is called Boss Hogg is up to something so they do what they can to stop him especially when someone close to them is being threatened by Hogg. So along with their Uncle Jesse, their lovely cousin Daisy, and their good friend and mechanic, Cooter they stop every one of Boss' schemes. They are also fortunate that Hogg's right hand man, Roscoe Coltrane who is also the Sheriff is not very competent, and that his Deputy though loyal to Hogg and Roscoe is not corrupt and has a thing for Daisy, is a tad clumsy. During the 5th season, Tom Wopat and John Schneider who play Luke and Bo had a contract dispute with the show, so they were written off with them at the NASCAR circuit, so cousins, Coy and Vance came to stay with Uncle Jesse and help him and Daisy with their encounters with Hogg. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3258e9043566c2ab0dbcacd1cc8985634c74b4f2","amp;dn":"The+Dukes+of+Hazzard+++%28The+Complete+Collector%5C%27s+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3258e9043566c2ab0dbcacd1cc8985634c74b4f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,88,233,4,53,102,194,171,13,188,172,209,204,137,133,99,76,116,180,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
