The movie takes the extremesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a rough tough prison guard, a drag queen, a football player, and many more who represent extremes of masculinity. The one thing they have in common is they are homosexual, but each has come to terms with who they are as a man. This is quite simply a series of talking heads who comment on what they think all of this means to gay society and how queer guys interact. The biggest question is, how much of an issue is all of this? Are you more of a man because you can beat people up and pass for straight, or is it rougher to be a sissy boy with bottles being thrown at you when you walk down the street? In the end the film can't answer the questions, merely meditate on it with a handful of testimonials.\n\nThere certainly is a need for a documentary like The Butch Factor, Christopher HinesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ thoughtful meditation on gay menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thorny relationship with all things butch (and, by extension, fem). \n\nHines introduces us to a cross-section of gay men discussing their feelings about what, precisely, it means to be a man. One football-playing jock describes his feelings of alienation from the gay scene. Too much talk of Madonna meant he never felt like he fit in, he says. Now he plays football with other gay, masculine men.\n\nHines is careful to traverse the butch-fem spectrum. There are drag queens, a gay rock band (The Ex-Boyfriends, and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re actually excellent), and my personal hero, a young fem who has embraced his gender-outlaw status and has the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSissyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tattooed on his shoulder. \n\nThe film really hits its stride when Hines delves into just how problematic gay menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationship to the butch thing is. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not called The Fem Factor for a reason.\n\nAs several gay academics contend, there is way too much fear of behaviour thought of as feminine within the gay milieu. Go visit any gay sex site, and the most common lines youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstraight acting, masc, looking for sameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ if not outright ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNO FEMS.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis constitutes a disturbing streak of self-loathing that runs through our community and, frankly, I wish it were talked about more.\n\nOne of the men interviewed says his straight friends are far more accepting of his gender nonconformity than people in the gay community. A number of the talking heads argue that this adherence to all things butch limits gay men and is almost certainly damaging.\n\nThe Butch Factor has some great ideas in it, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m all for any work of art that gets gay men thinking about their issues around internalized homophobia (which, by the way, also might suggest a deeply-rooted misogyny).\n\nBut HinesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ chosen form sets up some limitations for his argument. Schooled in made-for-TV docs, Hines keeps his camera moving, his images fused together with at times lightning-quick MTV-style edits. This creates the impression that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re too often coasting over important ideas and, to some extent, breezily glossing over the very lives heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chosen to focus on. Still, The Butch Factor offers plenty to think about","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ae85c807d02baf7c161d19f2a68b5fda15b00f5","amp;dn":"The+Butch+Factor+%5B2009%5D+Christopher+Hines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ae85c807d02baf7c161d19f2a68b5fda15b00f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,232,92,128,125,2,186,247,193,97,209,159,42,104,181,253,161,91,0,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
