The skills of the average sock knitter are increased through design exploration and advanced stitch manipulation, treating the sock as a knitted canvas where elements are strategically and intentionally placed. New designs of floral lace patterns, angular geometric shapes, and unusual cables are presented along with detailed instructions on modifications to suit needs and aesthetics. The incredible range of style and complexity in this guide runs from sweet and simple to delightfully imaginative.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e96d94dc093371c03f635eaa875a3198a0add6","amp;dn":"Cookie+A+-+Sock+Innovation+%28knitting%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e96d94dc093371c03f635eaa875a3198a0add6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,233,109,148,220,9,51,113,192,63,99,94,170,135,90,49,152,160,173,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
