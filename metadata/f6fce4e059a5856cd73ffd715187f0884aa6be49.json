Here, Chris Nodder shows how to get fast, inexpensive, and early validation of your design ideas, using the simplest of materials: paper, Post-it notes, index cards, and Sharpies. With these tools, you'll learn how to create paper prototypes and present them to representative users of your product or system. It's a great way to test your ideas before you write any code.\n\n\nPlease Seed and enjoy.\nRegards,\nMasum.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.sx/user/masum2444/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.sx/user/masum2444/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6fce4e059a5856cd73ffd715187f0884aa6be49","amp;dn":"Lynda-UX+Design+Techniques-Paper+Prototyping%5Bmasum2444%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6fce4e059a5856cd73ffd715187f0884aa6be49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,252,228,224,89,165,133,108,215,63,253,113,81,135,240,136,74,166,190,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
