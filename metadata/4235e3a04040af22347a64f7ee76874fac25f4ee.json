The course starts with a quick overview of the .NET platform, examining assemblies, Microsoft Intermediate Language, Visual Studio profiles, XML comments, IntelliSense, and debugging. From there, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn all the language features that you must internalize in order to create full-featured Web or Windows applications that make best use of the .NET platform. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn about data types, variables, and operators, along with all the important flow control structures. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll work through several examples demonstrating the power of the .NET Framework, and dig into creating and consuming your own classes and objects. The course moves on to working with data structures, such as arrays and collection classes, before finishing up with discussions of generics, handling exceptions and working with delegates and events. The course concludes by introducing the new LINQ-oriented features including anonymous types, lambda expressions, and more. By the end of this course, you will understand the important basic concepts that will allow you to start creating the applications you need.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4235e3a04040af22347a64f7ee76874fac25f4ee","amp;dn":"AppDev+-+Learning+to+Program+Using+Visual+C%23+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4235e3a04040af22347a64f7ee76874fac25f4ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,53,227,160,64,64,175,34,52,122,100,247,238,118,135,79,172,37,244,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
