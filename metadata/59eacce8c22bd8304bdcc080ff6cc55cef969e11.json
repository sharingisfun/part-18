Records, &quot;New Regulations&quot; on the &quot;Very Small World&quot; compilation on Very Small Records, and &quot;Long Way to Go&quot; on the &quot;They Don't Get Paid, They Don't Get Laid, But Boy Do They Work Hard!&quot; compilation LP on Maximum RocknRoll. Rumors of a CD release called &quot;Get Ready for Action&quot; have been circulating for years, and it's uncertain whether that will ever happen. Low quality recordings of the songs are available, hard to track down, and extremely well-received by Operation Ivy fans who have heard them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59eacce8c22bd8304bdcc080ff6cc55cef969e11","amp;dn":"Downfall+%28Get+Ready+for+Action%29+%2ARare%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59eacce8c22bd8304bdcc080ff6cc55cef969e11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,234,204,232,194,43,216,48,75,220,192,128,255,108,197,92,239,150,158,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
