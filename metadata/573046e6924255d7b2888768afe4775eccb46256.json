The primary focus of the character is thwarting Middle Eastern terrorist attacks on the United States and he is presented as an aggressive operative who is willing to take measures that are more extreme than might be considered commonly acceptable. His constant frustration with procedures and red tape are a major theme throughout the entire series. Profanity and adult themes are common, so the series is recommended for mature audiences.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:573046e6924255d7b2888768afe4775eccb46256","amp;dn":"Flynn%2C+Vince+-+Mitch+Rapp+Series%2CAll+Formats%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"573046e6924255d7b2888768afe4775eccb46256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,48,70,230,146,66,85,215,178,136,135,104,175,228,119,94,204,180,98,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
