All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was originally released on Albert Productions. A modified international edition was released on Atlantic Records in 1976.\n\nFollowing up on the preceding Australian album, 1975&amp;#039;s T.N.T., AC/DC delivered another crowd-pleasing recording with a number of fan-favourite songs, including the title track, &quot;Squealer&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot;, and others. Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap also contains some of the most controversial lyrics found on any AC/DC album.\n\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap also led to more AC/DC appearances on Australia&amp;#039;s Countdown music program, following those in support of High Voltage and T.N.T. These appearances included a live performance of the album&amp;#039;s title track, as well as a music video for &quot;Jailbreak&quot;.[1]\n\nIt&amp;#039;s also worth noting that a song titled &quot;I&amp;#039;m a Rebel&quot; was recorded during this album&amp;#039;s sessions in 1976, with music and lyrics written by Angus and Malcolm Young&amp;#039;s older brother, Alex Young. This song was never released and remains in Albert Productions&amp;#039; vaults.\n\nAngus came up with the title of the album when he watching and episode of Beany And Cecil. The antagonist, Dishonest John, carried a card that read: &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Special Holidays, Sundays and Rates&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; ? 4:13\n   2. &quot;Ain&amp;#039;t No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire)&quot; ? 7:31\n   3. &quot;There&amp;#039;s Gonna Be Some Rockin&amp;#039;&quot; ? 3:17\n   4. &quot;Problem Child&quot; ? 5:46\n   5. &quot;Squealer&quot; ? 5:16\n   6. &quot;Big Balls&quot; ? 2:40\n   7. &quot;R.I.P.
