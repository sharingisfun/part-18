See my other torrents for more classical guitar.\n\nComments from a review on Amazon:\n\nBorn in Havana, Cuba, in 1939, Leo Brouwer has written some of the most diverse music for any instrument during the last 60 years. You can hear his Cuban background in the dynamic Afro-Cuban strains of his work. And of course, as in all guitar music, there&amp;#039;s a rich Spanish element (in fact, one of Brouwer&amp;#039;s guitar teachers studied under a pupil of Francisco TÃƒÂ¡rrega). But on top of that there&amp;#039;s this interesting undercurrent of American folk music from the 1960s, which surely makes Brouwer unique among Latin guitar composers. Plus, you&amp;#039;ll be able to hear the influence of Messiaen, Bartok, Shostakovich, and Stravinsky in works like the &quot;Preludio&quot; of 1956 (written when Browuer was 17), &quot;Fuga No. 1&quot;, and &quot;Elogio a la danza&quot;. As a young guitarist Brouwer was disappointed that few of the great composers of his day had written anything for the guitar, so he just wrote it himself. He wrote his four books of &quot;Estudios sencillos&quot;, for example, to provide guitar students with a contemporary alternative to the classic works of men like Sor, Carcassi, and Coste.\n\nThis is a great place to begin if you&amp;#039;ve never listened to anything by Brouwer. It&amp;#039;s also incredibly cheap. Ricardo Cobos is one of the foremost interpreters of Brouwer&amp;#039;s work and it&amp;#039;s good to see such a quality recording come out on the inexpensive Naxos label. All I want to know is: where are the other volumes if this one&amp;#039;s just the first? 5 stars.
