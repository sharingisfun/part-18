Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. The song was written for and sung by The Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr as the character &quot;Billy Shears&quot;; it is ranked #304 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nJoe Cocker's version was a radical re-arrangement of the original, in a slower, 6/8 meter, using different chords in the middle eight, and a lengthy instrumental introduction (featuring drums by Procol Harum's B.J. Wilson, guitar lines from Jimmy Page, and organ by Tommy Eyre). It was used as the opening theme song of the American television series The Wonder Years and is one of Cocker's most famous songs. Cocker performed the song at Woodstock in 1969 and that performance was included in the documentary film, &quot;3 Days of Peace and Music&quot;. His cover was ranked number two in UpVenue's top 10 best music covers of all time in 2009. The version heard in the film Across the Universe segues from the original to Cocker's arrangement at the end of the song.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kaBOGaadc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kaBOGaadc&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 5800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Media Length: 00:04:48\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
