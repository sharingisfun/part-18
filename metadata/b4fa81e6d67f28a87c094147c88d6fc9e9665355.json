Nevertheless, this is a subject deserving attention. The first Soviet UAV to find large-scale use was the La-17 developed by the Lavochkin OKB, a fighter maker of World War II fame; it came in both target drone and reconnaissance versions. The Tupolev OKB, best known for its heavy bombers and commercial aircraft, also had a line of UAVs of varying size. The first of these was the Tu-123 Yastreb which started life as a heavy cruise missile but evolved into a supersonic unmanned spyplane; the book also describes the Tu-141 Strizh (Swift), which again came in reconnaissance and target versions, the Tu-243 Reys (Flight) and the latest Tu-300 recce/strike UAV. The Yakovlev OKB's unmanned aircraft are also covered, including the Pchela (Bee) surveillance UAV which has seen operational use in the Chechen wars; mention is also made of UAVs and drones developed by such companies as Strela and the Moscow Aviation Institute. The book is richly illustrated with black-and-white and color photos, including until-now unpublished ones, and line drawings.\n\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Soviet-Russian-Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles/dp/1857801938&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Soviet-Russian-Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles/dp/1857801938&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4fa81e6d67f28a87c094147c88d6fc9e9665355","amp;dn":"Soviet%2FRussian+Unmanned+Aerial+Vehicles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4fa81e6d67f28a87c094147c88d6fc9e9665355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,250,129,230,214,127,40,168,124,9,65,71,200,141,111,201,233,102,83,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
