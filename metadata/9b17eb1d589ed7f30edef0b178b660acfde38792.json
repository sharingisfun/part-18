A liberal version of Jesus Camp, the film introduces us to a radical California cult where sexual libertines, alien abductee-types and other weirdos aggregate to listen to the ludicrous preachings of a guru called Paul Lowe, who, with his British accent, toothpick limbs and long white hair, looks like the last surviving roadie for Humble Pie. His loosey-goosey seminars, conducted at a woodsy retreat somewhere off the path, are pure credit card spiritualism, with tubby boomers and glassy-eyed seekers of enlightenment all sitting enraptured while Lowe dispenses fortune cookie-deep aphorisms like &quot;nothing ever happens in the future -- it's all now.&quot; Those who attend are also encouraged to get nude at will and offer up their partners for sex swapping, which is obviously the major draw for both them and us the viewers. In fact, you could argue that The Workshop is little more than an episode of HBO's Real Sex expanded to feature length.
