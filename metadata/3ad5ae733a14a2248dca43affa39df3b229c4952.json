They hustle at the central train station and at clubs. \r\n    Most of their clients are foreign tourists, many are German. The youths talk about why they hustle, \r\n    their first trick, prices, dangers, what they know about AIDS, their fears (disease and loneliness), \r\n    and how they imagine their futures. The film's title, its liturgical score, much of it elegiac, and shots \r\n    of the city's statues of angels underline the vulnerability and callow lack of sophistication of the young men.\r\n\r\n(2) Documentary look at doomed male prostitutes in Prague, ages 15 to 18, who troll at the public swimming pool, \r\n    the train station, a video arcade, and a disco. After the boys talk about how they got in the game, \r\n    the camera follows them to the home of Pavel Rousek. Under the name Hans Miller, he makes gay porno videos, primarily for German distribution. \r\n    Intercut with a movie shoot chez Rousek is an interview that follows him to his day job at a morgue, \r\n    where he performs an autopsy as he talks about his work. The sex is without protection; the boys are without family. \r\n    They talk about their bodies and souls, money, their sexual orientation, AIDS, their dreams, and death.\r\n\r\n(1994, 1996) - Documentary - 6.7/10\r\n\r\nIMDB \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110690/ \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115722/\r\n\r\nEnglish Titles:\r\nNot Angels But Angels (1994)\r\nBody without Soul (Telo bez duse) (1996)\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\nCzech/English (original)\r\nRussian\r\n\r\nSubtitles (inside movie)\r\nEnglish (hardcoded by distributor; sometimes poorly)\r\nPortuguese\r\nSpanish\r\n(Synced to our best effort)\r\n\r\nDVD to mkv(highest quality), included Czech/English and Russian speaking and all possible subtitles.
