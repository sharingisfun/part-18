Throughout the 1980s, the band accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, earning four multi-platinum albums and selling millions of records. After being rejected by many U.S. record labels they signed with Columbia Records Canada and began recording their first album March 20, 1980 with Mike Reno on lead vocals, Paul Dean as the guitarist, Scott Smith as the bassist, Doug Johnson on keyboards and Matt Frenette on drums. The band's hit singles, particularly &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; and &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot;, have become arena rock staples and are still heard on many classic rock radio stations across the United States and Canada. They are currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Ones 1989\n\n\nBig Ones was an album released in 1989 by the Canadian rock band Loverboy.
