The LP,\nwhich follows 2006&amp;#039;s RIAA platinum-certified blockbuster\n&quot;15&quot;, arrives in stores at all digital retailers on\nSeptember 16.\n\nThe album ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ co-produced by longtime AEROSMITH\ncollaborator Marti Frederiksen (the co-writer of\nBUCKCHERRY&amp;#039;s top 10 smash &quot;Sorry&quot;) and BUCKCHERRY&amp;#039;s own\nKeith Nelson ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ will be offered in a standard CD package;\na &quot;limited fan club edition&quot; version, which comes with\nbonus tracks and a one-year membership to the BUCKCHERRY\nfan club; and a &quot;limited fan club edition&quot; bundle which\nadds a &quot;Black Butterfly&quot; T-shirt to the previous package.\n\n&quot;Black Butterfly&quot; is now available for preorder via\nBuckcherry.com. Fans who pre-order the &quot;limited-edition\nfan pack&quot; will receive the track &quot;Too DrunkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â &quot; at the time\nof their pre-order. The ringtone for the track is also\navailable on the band&amp;#039;s web site.\n\nThe title of the band&amp;#039;s last effort, &quot;15&quot;, was taken from\nthe amount of days it took the group to record the CD.\nSinger Josh Todd told The Pulse of Radio that the band\nhad a different reason for choosing &quot;Black Butterfly&quot;.\n&quot;We just thought it was a great iconic image,&quot; he said.\n&quot;It was actually one of the songs that didn&amp;#039;t make the\nrecord that we really liked. I&amp;#039;ve kind of been obsessed\nwith butterflies lately and we just wanted to have, like,\nkind of an iconic image like we did on our first record,\n&amp;#039;cause we always loved that first record cover, you know,\nand we&amp;#039;ve been trying to beat it since we started making\nrecords, you know.&quot;\n\nTrue road warriors, BUCKCHERRY will follow their current\ntour with a full-scale co-headline tour alongside AVENGED\nSEVENFOLD, slated to kick off in mid-September, running\nthrough the beginning of October.\n\nBUCKCHERRY recently released a &quot;dirty viral video&quot; (see\nbelow) for the song &quot;Too DrunkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â &quot;. &quot;I just wanted\nsomething that was funky,&quot; noted Todd, &quot;so we all\ncollaborated on it and turned it into something with a\nlot of space to breeze along and tell a story.&quot;\n\n&quot;Too DrunkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â &quot; made its way online earlier in the month,\nwith evidence suggesting that it was an intentional\n&quot;leak&quot; by the band&amp;#039;s management. The track is a\nBUCKCHERRY original and not a cover of the notorious tune\n&quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; by hardcore act the DEAD KENNEDYS\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134572f60ed982d78672bacbb4d9a0407306848c","amp;dn":"Buckcherry-Black_Butterfly-2008-ROCKNROLL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134572f60ed982d78672bacbb4d9a0407306848c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,69,114,246,14,217,130,215,134,114,186,203,180,217,160,64,115,6,132,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
