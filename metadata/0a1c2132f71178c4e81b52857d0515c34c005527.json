Well no, not really, says historian Robert Hutchinson in his revelatory new book. \n\nInstead he argues that the Spanish forces were defeated by a combination of bad weather, poor strategy and sheer ill fortune CHOICE Napoleon once called history &quot;a fiction that men agree to believe&quot;. The Spanish Armada is a case in point, as Robert Hutchinson ably demonstrates in this cogent, readable account of the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish forces in 1588.\n\nGenre: Non-fiction. History. England.
