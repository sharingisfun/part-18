With the combined success of this album and the previous album, Avalon Sunset, Morrison was once again in the pop/rock mainstream after a decade. The songs on the album were pulled from twenty-five years of material. One of the songs, &quot;Wonderful Remark&quot; had previously only been available on the soundtrack of the film, The King of Comedy.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Bright Side Of The Road\n[02] Gloria\t\t\t- THEM &amp; Van Morrison\n[03] Moondance\n[04] Baby Please Don't Go\t\t- THEM &amp; Van Morrison\n[05] Have I Told You Lately\n[06] Brown Eyed Girl\n[07] Sweet Thing\n[08] Warm Love\n[09] Wonderful Remark\t\t- From The Movie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKing Of ComedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n[10] Jackie Wilson Said\n[11] Full Force Gale\n[12] And It Stoned Me\n[13] Here Comes The Night\t\t- THEM &amp; Van Morrison\n[14] Domino\n[15] Did Ye Get Healed?\n[16] Wild Night\n[17] Cleaning Windows\n[18] Whenever God Shines His Light\t- With Cliff Richard\n[19] Queen Of The Slipstream\n[20] Dweller On The Threshold\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 01h:16m:13s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 181mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t\t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Rock\n\nRelease Date\t\t- January 1990\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Polydor\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.vanmorrison.com \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * PLEASE SEED TO A RATIO OF 1:1 OR GREATER * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LL ONLY RE-SEED IF THERE IS MORE THAN 10 PEERS WAITING * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1427c5f3ee6c47f70e6d138c8b57cfb1fcf208c0","amp;dn":"%5B1990%5D+The+Best+Of+-+Van+Morrison+-+182mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1427c5f3ee6c47f70e6d138c8b57cfb1fcf208c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,39,197,243,238,108,71,247,14,109,19,140,139,87,207,177,252,242,8,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
