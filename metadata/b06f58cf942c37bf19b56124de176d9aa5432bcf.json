This book reveals the skillful tactics of the Apache people as they raided and eluded the much larger and better-equipped US government forces. Drawing on primary research conducted in the deserts of New Mexico and Arizona, this book reveals the small-unit warfare of the Apache tribes as they attempted to preserve their freedom, and in particular the actions of the most famous member of the Apache tribes - Geronimo.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Apache-Tactics-1830-86-Elite-Robert/dp/1849086303/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327172867&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Apache-Tactics-1830-86-Elite-Robert/dp/1849086303/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327172867&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06f58cf942c37bf19b56124de176d9aa5432bcf","amp;dn":"Apache+Tactics+1830-86+%28Osprey+Elite%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06f58cf942c37bf19b56124de176d9aa5432bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,111,88,207,148,44,55,191,25,181,97,36,222,23,109,154,165,67,43,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
