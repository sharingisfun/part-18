ELO was formed in Birmingham, England in the autumn of 1970 from the ashes of the eccentric art-pop combo the Move, reuniting frontman Roy Wood with guitarist/composer Jeff Lynne, bassist Rick Price, and drummer Bev Bevan. Announcing their intentions to 'pick up where 'I Am the Walrus' left off,' the quartet sought to embellish their engagingly melodic rock with classical flourishes, tapping French horn player Bill Hunt and violinist Steve Woolam to record their self-titled debut LP (issued as No Answer in the U.S.). In the months between the sessions for the album and its eventual release, the Move embarked on their farewell tour, with Woolam exiting the ELO lineup prior to the enlistment of violinist Wilf Gibson, bassist Richard Tandy, and cellists Andy Craig and Hugh McDowell; despite the lengthy delay, Electric Light Orchestra sold strongly, buoyed by the success of the U.K. Top Ten hit '10538 Overture.'\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t14034-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.90% CDDA &amp; 99.91% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Alright\n02.Turn To Stone\n03.Twilight\n04.Secret Messages\n05.Ticket To The Moon\n06.Evil Woman\n07.Livin' Thing\n08.Just For Love\n09.Xanadu (New Version)\n10.Love Changes All\n11.Ordinary Dream\n12.Last Train To London\n13.Now You're Gone\n14.Moment In Paradise\n15.Four Little Diamonds\n16.Strange Magic\n17.Showdown\n18.Telephone Line\n19.Don't Bring Me Down\n20.Mr. Blue Sky\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Helpless\n02.Sweet Talkin' Woman\n03.Shine A Little Love\n04.A Long Time Gone\n05.So Serious\n06.All Over The World\n07.I'm Alive\n08.Calling America\n09.Can't Get It Out Of My Head\n10.The Diary Of Horace Wimp\n11.Confusion\n12.Melting In The Sun\n13.Every Little Thing\n14.Stranger On A Quiet Street\n15.Don't Say Goodbye\n16.It Really Doesn't Matter\n17.Great Balls Of Fire\n18.Rock &amp; Roll Is King\n19.Hold On Tight\n20.Do Ya\n21.10538 Overture\n22.Roll Over Beethoven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb390df2e9716f1536e2876187a1afcb86d07780","amp;dn":"Electric+Light+Orchestra+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282008%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb390df2e9716f1536e2876187a1afcb86d07780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,57,13,242,233,113,111,21,54,226,135,97,135,161,175,203,134,208,119,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
