The process can work simply from common heading styles, or\ncustom methods can be designed based on new codes for marking text that is significant to the TOC (codes RPS and RPE). \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The &quot;help&quot; facility has been greatly extended and improved (with thanks to Techno-Vision, Duxbury's UK distributor, for the bulk of this work) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ JAWS and Window Eyes screen readers now read highlighted text. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Control-down arrow and Control-up arrow now allow movement down and up in a DBT document by paragraph. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Incremental typing is now supported in all list boxes. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supported Embossers now include the Tiger Advantage and Elekul. A number of other embossers, formerly listed only generically, are now more clearly identified\naccording to manufacturer and model name. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The Microsoft Word file import facility has been extensively improved, notably to map &quot;character&quot; styles as well as &quot;paragraph&quot; styles, and to permit\ncontrol over the handling of hard and soft page breaks and multiple skipped lines. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The formatted braille (BRF) file import has been improved so that it can now be used to import ED-IT PC braille files. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A &quot;hard hyphen&quot; can now be imported and has been implemented in various contexts, e.g. to prevent splitting up number ranges across lines. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The LaTeX importer has been improved so that a wider range of file coding styles can now be imported successfully. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ It is now possible to export print text using Windows encoding for accented letters etc. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The option to install British templates is now presented as an installation option for new installations. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Braille fonts are now generated on the fly for Windows. DBT maintains a special table that controls the link between ASCII characters in the DBT braille\nfile and the way in which the braille is displayed on the screen and on a braille device. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ An &quot;English/American Textbook&quot; translation table has been added, to accommodate the differences between general literary practice and the former &quot;Textbook\nFormats&quot; manual (now called &quot;Braille Formats&quot;). The unqualified &quot;English/American&quot; table continues to support the standard literary base code defined in\n&quot;English Braille American Edition.&quot; The &quot;Textbook&quot; template now refers to this new American Textbook table. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bulgarian/Uncontracted translation tables have been added. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Greek (Modern)/Uncontracted translation tables have been added. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Vietnamese/Uncontracted translation tables have been added, with an experimental extension for math. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The English/British translation tables have been changed so that computer notation is now done according to BAUK conventions instead of the BANA Computer\nBraille Code (CBC). \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ An English/Australian translation table has been added, in which literary material follows British practice while computer notation is handled according\nto BANA CBC. (This is in effect the same as the table previously identified as English / British.) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Both the Cymraeg (Welsh) and Irish Gaelic translation tables now have both &quot;with Capitals&quot; and &quot;without Capitals&quot; forms. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The French table now has an &quot;Uncontracted&quot; as well as the regular (contracted) form. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A warning is now given when attempting to translate a file which has already been translated. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ There have been minor corrections, updates and improvements in virtually all areas of DBT. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Although not directly a part of DBT, the distribution CD now contains an enhanced version of SWIFT, a Word macro that lets you send a file directly to\nDBT from within Word. (SWIFT and the newer SWIFTER were produced by Techno-Vision, Duxbury's UK distributor.) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The &quot;WordPort&quot; add-in for certain file imports is no longer included with DBT, though it will remain available in cases where updates are installed into\nthe same directory where an earlier DBT with Wordport is already installed. This should only affect imports of some obscure older file formats; current\nformats such as Word, WordPerfect, LaTeX, HTML and XML, etc. are imported directly by DBT without using the add-in. (We nevertheless encourage users with\nspecial import requirements to let us know, as it is likely that we can suggest a solution.) \n\n\nplease Note that this is not the latest version, but it is here inthe mean time\n\nTo install the DBT Win, follow the following steps:\nIf you have floppy drive:\n1. Extract all the files where you like to have them.\n2. Save the file named hjgmw. which is in DBT 10.4 licence key folder to a\nfloppy drive.\n3. Run setup.exe file.\n4.
