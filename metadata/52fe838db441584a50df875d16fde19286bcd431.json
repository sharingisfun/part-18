I have an AMD and an Intel computer \nand wanted to simplify the install. I have made it with max compatability in \nmind, but your mileage may vary. All original Languages are included.\n\nUnrar the Leo4All.ISO and burn with UltraISO or equivilant in Windows, or use \nDisk Utility in OSX.\n\nThe MD5 Checksum of the ISO should be 9d5a50fc18efeb41636ce42801fd45f3\n\nPlease support Apple and buy a copy, you won&amp;#039;t regret it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe system is setup by default to boot in Verbose mode. You can change this yourself if you want in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist. I included BBEdit with the applications, it can edit the file in place with correct permissions.\n\nDuring the DVD bootup if your stuck at &quot;waiting for root device&quot; I am sorry your hardware is probably not supported. You can try changing some options in your BIOS, maybe you get lucky.\n\nIf you get error com.apple.boot.plist not found your DVD is most likely bad, burn it again at a lower speed.\n\nIf you have an AMD system please check the box for AMD-System-Fix to aplly the patches needed for Leopard to work!!\n\nAHCI works, but you are limited to two drives, turn this off if you have more than 2 drives you need to access.\n\nIf you have an older computer with limited options in the BIOS(ACPI/APIC) and you are able to install but when you boot the freshly installed O/S you are stuck just after ACPI loads, try installing with the APIC-Fix checked. This will install an Older ACPIPlatform and APIC for better compatability.\n\nVideo Driver support is very hit or miss, please install first without it. You can easily add this yourself afterwards.\n\nThe EFI bootloader automatically detects and installs for MBR/GUID thanks to Dense, it may have specific problems for Bad-Axe 2 systems.\n\nPlease select your IDE/SATA chipset during install.(One and only one!)\n\nDefault selection for kernel is Netkas improved 9.2.0. If you select Vanilla kernel please uncheck Netkas kernel.\n\nIf during the inital account creation your system locks up, try disabling your Network card. \n\nIf you installed Video drivers during install(not recommended) and your system freezes before the desktop loads, boot with -s and remove the Video kexts.\n\nIf after you boot to the desktop you get an error about an Extension not being properly installed open the Application I included called Extensions-Repair to correct this automatically.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52fe838db441584a50df875d16fde19286bcd431","amp;dn":"Leo4All-10.5.2+Universal+AMD%2FINTEL%5BSSE2%2FSSE3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52fe838db441584a50df875d16fde19286bcd431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,254,131,141,180,65,88,74,80,223,135,93,22,253,225,146,134,188,212,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
