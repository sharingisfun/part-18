Little Piece of England (05:59)\n\nFollowing the farewell tour of Waking the Witch in spring 2008, and armed with a bunch of brand new songs, Patsy set about recording a solo album, 'Little Piece of England'. She teamed up with producer/guitarist Sam Bartholomew with the aim of making a stripped back recording that felt as close to a real, unamplified, acoustic sound as possible\nUnlike her previous recordings (With My Boots On 1996 and Breathe Me 1997) Patsy decided against multi-tracking her own vocals for harmonies. &quot;After working with the Witches, it would have seemed really strange to sing along with myself. I love the textures provided by different people's voices so this time I've used some male vocals from Sam and others by the excellent Gina Dootson.&quot; Chumbawhamba's Harry Hamer also joins the line-up on percussion.\nContrasting with a CD booklet of flamboyant artwork, the album is a subtle snapshot of England in song. Weaving a light and shade tapestry of English people and places around more personal numbers it manages to feel both nostalgic and contemporary, highlighting her intuitive lightness of touch.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/18/patsy-matheson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/18/patsy-matheson/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ddcf4fd6ce0a211492cfa5f6177d06d95b15ff3","amp;dn":"Patsy+Matheson...Little+Piece+of+England%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ddcf4fd6ce0a211492cfa5f6177d06d95b15ff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,220,244,253,108,224,162,17,73,44,250,95,97,119,208,109,149,177,95,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
