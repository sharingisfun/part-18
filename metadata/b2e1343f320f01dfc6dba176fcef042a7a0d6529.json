Fly fast paced bombing missions or fire rockets and machine guns at the enemy whilst the accurate flight dynamics adapt to the ever-changing situation!\nIntroduction\n\nThe Grumman F8F Bearcat (affectionately called Ã¢â‚¬Å“BearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) was an American single-engine naval fighter aircraft of the 1940s. It went on to serve into the mid-20th century with the United States Navy and other air forces, proving to be GrummanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimate piston-engine fighter aircraft.\n\nThe Bearcat concept was inspired by the early 1943 evaluation of a captured Focke-Wulf Fw190 by Grumman test pilots and engineering staff. Having been informed of the Fw190Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s performance, company President Leroy Grumman personally laid out the specifications for the successor to the legendary F6F Hellcat.\nThe basic design closely emulated the philosophy of the German fighter, although no part of the Fw190 was copied. The F8F Bearcat stemmed from the primary goal of outperforming highly maneuverable late-model Japanese fighter aircraft such as the A6M5 Zero.\nNoteworthy Features\n\n    As with every Vertigo Studios aircraft, it is gorgeously constructed, inside and out.\n\n    2 x models included, F8F-1 and F8F-2\n    Designed and built by the book.\n    Comes complete with a comprehensive PDF manual.\n    3D Ã¢â‚¬ËœSound ConeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Technology with an amazing sound set, engineered using authentic Pratt &amp; Whitney R2800 recordings.\n    Every object or function creates a realistic noise!\n    A dynamic load editor that will affect aircraft weights on the fly.\n    DirectX 10 compatible models complete with virtual cockpit self-shadowing.\n    Systems and Tru3D gauges for ultimate realism taken beyond whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available by default.\n    Tru3D Instrumentation for the ultimate smooth flying experience.\n    Tru3D gauge lighting brings the instruments to life at night!\n    Fully customized lighting control system, including individually created night-lighting effects.\n    V-studios customized high-resolution materials give the most realistic appearance\n    6 historically accurate and detailed paint schemes.\n    Fuel delivery system is accurately simulated.\n    2D Pop-ups, Configuration Editor, GPS and Radio.\n    Realistic canopy operation and animation.\n    Fully operable weapons pack with multiple munitions, including guns, bombs and rockets!\n    Light bloom on glass and shiny materials.\n    Exciting custom-made effects.\n    Atmospheric effects and a realistic de-fogging system.\n\nConfiguration Editor\n\nA configuration editor is provided in-game to allow the F8F to be totally customized and readied for any mission!\n\nAmmunition can be loaded by the round, with each unit affecting the weight individually.
