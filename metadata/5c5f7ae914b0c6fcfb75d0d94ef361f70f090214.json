Picking up the pseudo-mysticism and Native American obsessions of the Doors, the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin, and the three-chord crunch of AC/DC, while adding touches of post-punk goth rock, the Cult gained a dedicated following in their native Britain with mid-'80s singles like &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; before breaking into the American metal market in the late '80s with &quot;Love Removal Machine.&quot; Though they managed one Top Ten in America with 1989's Sonic Temple, the Cult were plagued with off-stage tensions and problems that prevented them from retaining their popularity. The band split in 1995 following a pair of unsuccessful records, but returned on an occasional basis for new records -- always anchored by vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.80% CDDA &amp; 100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tCooking Vinyl\nCatalog:\t\tCOOKCD548\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Honey From A Knife\n02.Elemental Light\n03.The Wolf\n04.Life &gt; Death \n05.For The Animals\n06.Amnesia\n07.Wilderness Now\n08.Lucifer\n09.A Pale Horse\n10.This Night In The City Forever\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Every Man And Woman Is A Star\n02.Embers\n03.Until The Light Takes Us\n04.Siberia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c5f7ae914b0c6fcfb75d0d94ef361f70f090214","amp;dn":"The+Cult+-+Choice+Of+Weapon+%5BDeluxe%5D+%282012%29+Flac+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c5f7ae914b0c6fcfb75d0d94ef361f70f090214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,95,122,233,20,176,198,252,251,117,208,217,78,243,97,247,15,9,2,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
