The winner of the Man Booker Prize is generally assured of international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade.\n\nThe American authors Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler are among the six writers selected for the shortlist of the 2014 Man Booker Prize for Fiction, announced on Tuesday. Also on the shortlist are three British writers Ã¢â‚¬â€ Howard Jacobson, Neel Mukjerjee and Ali Smith Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the Australian Richard Flanagan. The winner of the prize, worth around $80,000 and widely considered the most prestigious literary award in Britain, will be announced on Oct.14.\n\nMr. Ferris was nominated for Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Rise Again at a Decent Hour,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Viking); Ms. Fowler for Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Are All Completely Beside OurselvesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (SerpentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tail); Mr. Flanagan for Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Narrow Road to the Deep NorthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Chatto &amp; Windus); Mr. Jacobson for Ã¢â‚¬Å“JÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Jonathan Cape); Mr. Mukherjee for Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Lives of OthersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Chatto &amp; Windus); and Ms. Smith for Ã¢â‚¬Å“How to be BothÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Hamish Hamilton).\n\nThis is the first year writers from outside Britain, Ireland and the Commonwealth are eligible for the prize, provided they write in English and have been published in Britain. The longlist of 13, chosen from a pool of 154 novels and announced in July, also included the American writers Siri Hustvedt, Richard Powers and Joseph OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neill. Six British novelists, including Mr. Jacobson, who won the prize in 2010, and the Irish writer Niall Williams and Mr. Flanagan, completed the list.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:737f69088a9eb80d38b9344a78e77f1b3cc913d5","amp;dn":"Man+Booker+Prize+For+Fiction+Short+List+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"737f69088a9eb80d38b9344a78e77f1b3cc913d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,127,105,8,138,158,184,13,56,185,52,74,120,231,127,27,60,201,19,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
