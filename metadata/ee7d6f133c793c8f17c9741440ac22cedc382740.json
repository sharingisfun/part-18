And yet, for thousands of years, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been diving into danger in an epic quest to overcome our earthbound constraints.\nIn this exhilarating program, join host Daniel Wilson as he uncovers the physics, biology, and technology behind SKYDIVING. At the Zephyrhills drop zone in Florida, join a group of first-time jumpers 13,000 feet above the ground and witness what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to free fall through the air at 120 miles per hour. Next, learn about the death-defying art of BASE jumpingÃ¢â‚¬â€a clever acronym for an extreme sport that sees people jumping from buildings, antennae, spans, and earth. Get an inside look at how parachutesÃ¢â‚¬â€a skydiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelineÃ¢â‚¬â€actually work, and meet the brave test jumpers who put their lives on the line to ensure the safety of new parachute designs. Finally, get a firsthand look at specially designed wing suits that allow experienced divers to trade falling for flying and soar like birds through the air.\n\nFeaturing breathtaking footage, fascinating science, and expert interviews, SKYDIVING unlocks the secrets behind what has driven people for hundreds of years to push the human limits.\n\nh264 encoded from DVD source","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee7d6f133c793c8f17c9741440ac22cedc382740","amp;dn":"The+Works+-+Skydiving+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee7d6f133c793c8f17c9741440ac22cedc382740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,125,111,19,60,121,60,143,23,201,116,20,64,172,34,206,220,56,39,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
