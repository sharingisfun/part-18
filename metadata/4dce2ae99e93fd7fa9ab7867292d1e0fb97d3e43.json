No one has leaked it yet\n(the savegame editor can do many things - such as make you near invincable -  but the trainer can make you truly invincable)\n\nAfter reaching level 20 - and earning nearly 200 gold honestly - I used this savegame editor to max out all my stats on all characters... worked great!\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the GAME here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6228419/Dragon_Age_2-RELOADED&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6228419/Dragon_Age_2-RELOADED&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDownload the ADDON here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6243153/Dragon_Age_2_DLC_Pack_%28with_Patch_1.01%29_-illiria&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6243153/Dragon_Age_2_DLC_Pack_%28with_Patch_1.01%29_-illiria&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dce2ae99e93fd7fa9ab7867292d1e0fb97d3e43","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+2+SaveGame+Editor+Cheat+Trainer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dce2ae99e93fd7fa9ab7867292d1e0fb97d3e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,206,42,233,158,147,253,127,169,171,120,103,41,45,30,15,185,125,62,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
