During this period, the band has sold in excess of 30 million albums, and played to countless millions of fans across the globe. In 1982, they released their eighth studio album SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE, containing their hugely successful YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Got Another Thing Coming, the single which proved that metal could get mainstream radio airplay in the US Ã¢â‚¬â€œ leading the way for a whole generation of new metal bands.\n\nTo celebrate the 30 year anniversary of this epic release, Judas Priest present you with SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SPECIAL 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, containing not only the re-mastered original album plus bonus tracks, but also a live DVD from the 1983 US Festival show, filmed in San Bernadino CA on 29th May 1983.\n\nThe US Festival was intended to be a celebration of evolving technologies; a marriage of music, computers, television and people - organized by Steve Wozniak formerly of Apple Computer.\n\nThe SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SPECIAL 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION Live DVD was filmed at the second, and what turned out to be last, US Festival in 1983. The Sunday was the Heavy Metal Day -&quot;It was the day new wave died and rock n' roll took over&quot;. It set the single-day concert attendance record for the US with an estimated 375,000 people.\n\nJudas Priest have this to say about this memorable day in metal history:\n\n'On the day that we performed, we flew in by helicopter - and the first sight we saw was that of thousands of abandoned cars piled up around the crests of the hills that surrounded the festival arena, which as we went over took our breath away. For there below us, spread throughout hundreds of acres was a massive crowd Ã¢â‚¬â€œ over three hundred thousand strong! The summer heat was raging and combined with the hot Santa Ana winds made for a scorching metal furnace on stage.'\n\n1. The Hellion\n2. Electric Eye\n3. Riding On The Wind\n4. Bloodstone\n5.
