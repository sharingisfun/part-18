More than a biography of the greatest literary genius the American theater has produced, this American Experience production is a moving meditation on loss and redemption, family and memory, the cost of being an artist, and the inescapability of the past. It is also a penetrating exploration of the masterpieces O'Neill created only at the very end of his career -- &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; and &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night&quot; pre-eminent among them -- brought to life in mesmerizing scenes performed especially for the production by some of the most gifted actors working in theater today, including Al Pacino, Zoe Caldwell, Christopher Plummer, Robert Sean Leonard, Liam Neeson, and Vanessa Redgrave.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:996e83953b54682562e223cf166edf92466534e7","amp;dn":"American+Experience+-+Eugene+O%27Neil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"996e83953b54682562e223cf166edf92466534e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,110,131,149,59,84,104,37,98,226,35,207,22,110,223,146,70,101,52,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
