But they don't. Howell J. Malham Jr. has created a simply designed and illustrated book that goes straight to the heart of the issue. Through the largely facetious dialog of two line drawn colorful characters, this clever, irreverent book seeks to get everyone in the room on the same page using the same definitions for the same words. This is a crucial first step to any business proposition, yet it is often the most overlooked.\n- An open and visual book that defines the most over-used (and least understood) business term: strategy\n- Author is the co-founder of Insight Labs\n- Produced in a wry style, this book offers a witty, inventive take on a common business problem\nAt a time when business in general is groping in the dark for new solutions to persistent problems, this book is a breath of fresh air, reminding readers that they have to build a foundation before they can scale the walls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:210135a5da4446b94129f9d3975aad533129ad1c","amp;dn":"I+Have+a+Strategy+%28No+You+Don%27t%29%3A+The+Illustrated+Guide+to+Strat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"210135a5da4446b94129f9d3975aad533129ad1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,1,53,165,218,68,70,185,65,41,249,211,151,90,173,83,49,41,173,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
