Kicked out of Metallica, the band he co-founded, in 1982, the guitarist/vocalist got his revenge by forming Megadeth. His mission statement for his new group: \\\\\\&quot;...to be the fastest, utmost furious heavy metal band ever.\\\\\\&quot; But if anybody embodied the philosophy \\\\\\&quot;live hard, play hard\\\\\\&quot; it was Mustaine, who battled heroin addiction for nearly 10 years. Five lineups, 16 trips to rehab, one near-death experience, and more than 20 million albums later, Megadeth have more than made their mark in metal. Also included: \\\\\\&quot;too hot for MTV/VH1\\\\\\&quot; version of the video for \\\\\\&quot;Moto Psycho.\\\\\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1fe261f01af7f8b9d9c410f7797b8bf1c9d76a","amp;dn":"Megadeth+-+VH1+Behind+the+Music+Extended+DVDRip_thornhart.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1fe261f01af7f8b9d9c410f7797b8bf1c9d76a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,31,226,97,240,26,247,248,185,217,196,16,247,121,123,139,241,201,215,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
