This special limited-edition hardback is the first ever collection of the Eagle Comics editions, with Kevin OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neill (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) colouring his original artwork. It will also include the very hard-to-find Nemesis Poster Prog strip, The Tomb of Torquemada. Written by 2000 AD creator Pat Mills (Marshal Law) and also featuring artwork by Jesus Redondo (Star Trek: Voyager)\n\nIn the far future, EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s citizens live deep in the bowels of the Earth and in constant fear of their leader - the diabolically evil Torquemada. But one being leads the resistance to TorquemadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s despotic rule - the legendary alien freedom fighter, Nemesis the Warlock. Insane, visceral, mind-blowingly imaginative, political, satirical, and unlike any comic before or since - Nemesis the Warlock is one of 2000 ADÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful and famous characters by two of its greatest creators","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4d38a5d4410dca986af6ded2f16dcedc0bd291f","amp;dn":"Nemesis+the+Warlock+-+Deviant+Edition+%282013%29+%28Digital%29+%28DR+%26amp%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4d38a5d4410dca986af6ded2f16dcedc0bd291f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,211,138,93,68,16,220,169,134,175,109,237,47,22,220,237,192,189,41,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
