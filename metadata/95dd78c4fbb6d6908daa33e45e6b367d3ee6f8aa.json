Its president, Mino Arakawa, was stuck with two thousand unsold arcade cabinets for a dud of a game (Radar Scope). So he hatched a plan.\n\nBack in Japan, a boyish, shaggy-haired staff artist named Shigeru Miyamoto designed a new game for the unsold cabinets featurÃ‚Â­ing an angry gorilla and a small jumping man. Donkey Kong brought in $180 million in its first year alone and launched the career of a short, chubby plumber named Mario.\n\nSince then, Mario has starred in over two hundred games, genÃ‚Â­erating profits in the billions. He is more recognizable than Mickey Mouse, yet heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little more than a mustache in bib overalls. How did a mere smear of pixels gain such huge popularity?\n\nSuper Mario tells the story behind the Nintendo games millions of us grew up with, explaining how a Japanese trading card company rose to dominate the fiercely competitive video-game industry.\n\nMike Musgrove\nNintendo did not, alas, cooperate with this author. As a result, some of Ryan's anecdotes are left with an asterisk hanging by them in the reader's mind. Without a doubt, however, Super Mario is packed with enough strangeÃ¢â‚¬â€and confirmedÃ¢â‚¬â€nuggets to please most fansÃ¢â‚¬Â¦For the most part, the pages here turn as quickly as any of Mario's platform-jumping adventures. Ã¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n\nPublishers Weekly\nThe history of how a Japanese video game featuring two Italian brothers became one of America's favorite pastimes is covered in exhaustive, enthusiastic detail by video game reviewer Ryan. The author takes readers through Nintendo's early business machinations; the story of Mario's eccentric creator, Shigeru Miyamoto; and the game-changing emergence of Nintendo's motion controller for the Wii, with a breezy journalistic style. At times the tone slips into the white hatÃ¢â‚¬â€œblack hat morality employed in most video games, often painting Nintendo's business competitors or detractors with broad reductive strokesÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;hardcore gamers sneer at Wii&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€and paeans to new Nintendo releases get smattered with exclamation points, so that some pages read like Nintendo promo material. All of this is distracting but not fatal, and the book is a thorough history of Nintendo's victories, written by an enthusiastic and knowledgeable fan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95dd78c4fbb6d6908daa33e45e6b367d3ee6f8aa","amp;dn":"Jeff+Ryan+-+Super+Mario+How+Nintendo+Conquered+America+%5B96%5D+Unab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95dd78c4fbb6d6908daa33e45e6b367d3ee6f8aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,221,120,196,251,182,214,144,141,170,51,228,94,107,54,125,62,230,248,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
