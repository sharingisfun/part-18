The Safe Side's &quot;Safe Side Super-Chick&quot; is a decidedly \nzany host who successfully combines slapstick humor with serious, practical \nsafety tips for kids. &quot;Safe Side Super-Chick&quot; breaks the population down into \nthree quickly discernable categories: &quot;Safe Side Adults&quot; that kids know well and \ncan always trust to keep them safe, &quot;Don't Knows&quot; like the mail carrier or the \nlady at the park and &quot;Sorta Knows&quot; like a coach or a schoolmate's parent. As \n&quot;Safe Side Super-Chick&quot; interacts with &quot;Don't Knows&quot; and &quot;Sorta Knows&quot;, she \noffers seven specific safety tips to keep kids safe and, with the help of real \nkids, details simple, concrete actions and phrases that empower kids in a \nvariety of potentially dangerous situations. Best of all, the presentation is \nnever scary, but always extremely funny--that means that kids ages 2 to 10 will \nactually enjoy learning about safety. Kudos to Julie Clark (creator of Baby \nEinstein) and John Walsh (host of America's Most Wanted) for creating a safety \nvideo that's highly entertaining, informative, and practical.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:287a8821f4d9bf7a72eca821a7e4c976af5a82be","amp;dn":"Stranger+Safety%5B2005%5D_DVDrip_Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"287a8821f4d9bf7a72eca821a7e4c976af5a82be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,122,136,33,244,217,191,122,114,236,168,33,167,228,201,118,175,90,130,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
