She'll have the badge two weeks, then the new marshal arrives to take over. Meanwhile, the unscrupulous Erica Page, the saloon-mistress, is busy buying up local property because she has a tip the railroad is going to make Oracle a depot stop. The cowardly mayor warns her that the railroad may not come to Oracle, but Erica already had that base covered, as after she makes payment on the land, she has her moronic henchman, Jake Hayes, murder the seller, take back the money, return it to her so she can buy some more land. Erica is a businesswoman who believes in a fast return on investment. But, in order to get away cleanly, if the railroad does not come through, she sends Jake out-of-state to Tombstone to hire a gunslinger to come kill Rose. He brings back a hired gun who falls in love with his intended target.\n \nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nApÃƒÂ³s assassinato do marido, viÃƒÂºva assume o posto de xerife da cidade.\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828538012760620672441514204a18831984ce09","amp;dn":"Gunslinger+%5BRoger+Corman%5D+%281956%29+DVDRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828538012760620672441514204a18831984ce09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,133,56,1,39,96,98,6,114,68,21,20,32,74,24,131,25,132,206,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
