I capped it from the online stream on the itv.com website right after broadcast (since has been removed). Quality isn't as great as an HDTV cap, but its still good enough to watch. \n\nI had previously uploaded this as S01E02 because I was considering the one off special/pilot broadcasted back in January as S01E01 but since then, groups have been numbering episodes with this one being S01E01. So to remove any confusion, I've renamed this S01E01 as it should have originally been. Sorry about that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99ea818093db0332765bc6c0d73484b996ff40ab","amp;dn":"Penn+And+Teller+Fool+Us+S01E01+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99ea818093db0332765bc6c0d73484b996ff40ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,234,129,128,147,219,3,50,118,91,198,192,215,52,132,185,150,255,64,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
