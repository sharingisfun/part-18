The first of his beloved novels featuring the fictional county of Barsetshire, The Warden, introduces listeners to Septimus Harding, the warden and kindly caretaker at Hiram' s Hospital for elderly gentlemen. Though Hiram' s is a charitable hospital, its estate has lately begun to take in a substantial profit, making the townsfolk-- and Mr. Harding himself-- question the terms of the warden' s growing salary.\r\n\r\nAnthony Trollope-Barchester Towers\r\n\r\nFirst, a warning: If you haven't read any Trollope, start with The Warden; it's the first in a series of which Barchester is second. Next, a rather shocking warning: Trollope may be as addictive as a soap opera. It has plenty of the right ingredients-archly drawn characters and plots that enmesh the listener in the daily ups and downs of those characters' lives. Of course, the great crevasse that divides your average daytime soap from Barchester Towers is the elegance and skill of the writer and the witty invention from which he draws his charming and classic fantasies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0802d40ebafb83b718d59d55963fe4c14f227ef","amp;dn":"Anthony+Trollope-Barchester+Towers+%26amp%3B+The+Warden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0802d40ebafb83b718d59d55963fe4c14f227ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,128,45,64,235,175,184,59,113,141,89,213,89,99,254,76,20,242,39,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
