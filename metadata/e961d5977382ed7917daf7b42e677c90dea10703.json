This album included the singles &quot;No Trash in My Trailer&quot;[3] (a cover of a Gene Watson song) and &quot;Ride Through the Country&quot; (a duet with John Michael Montgomery), the latter of which did not chart until the week of October 10, 2009 when it debuted at #57 on the Hot Country Songs chart. He also appeared on a rap remix of Montgomery Gentry's late-2008 Number One single &quot;Roll with Me.&quot;[4] Ford's debut album also has guest appearances from country singer Jamey Johnson, as well as Bone Crusher and Jermaine Dupri, Adrian Young of NoDoubt and Jeremy Popoff of Lit.[5] The album did not enter the Billboard albums charts until 2009.\n\nFord co-wrote and originally recorded the song &quot;Dirt Road Anthem&quot; for his debut album Ride Through the Country, which was later covered by Brantley Gilbert on his 2010 album Halfway To Heaven[6], and again by Jason Aldean on his album My Kinda Party, also from 2010.[7]\n\nFord wrote the theme song &quot;Buck 'em&quot; for the Professional Bull Riders association. \n\nArtist:  Colt Ford\n?
