Eve was the cause of original sin for tempting Adam in the Garden of Eden. An early church father had this to say to women: &quot;The curse God pronounced on your sex weighs still upon the world. You are guilty ? you must bear its hardships. You are the Devil?s gateway&quot;.\n\nThe Church preached hatred of the flesh and promoted the cult of virginity. Robert tells of the compelling story of Christina of Markyate who defied her parents and her husband to maintain her chastity.\n\nAnd yet it was the medieval world that gave birth to the modern concept of romantic love. 12th century troubadours began to sing songs of love to women who were to be adored. \n\nFor the upper classes at least, the rules of love were reinvented in lengthy treatises, the heroes and heroines of love celebrated in poems: Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Iseult.\n\nRobert tells the tragic story of the real life lovers Abelard and HÃƒÂ©loise ? Abelard the great scholar, HÃƒÂ©loise the niece of a canon at the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Their love letters from the 12th century are astonishing in their frankness, passion and willingness to break conventions.\n\nUp, retrack- shunster\n\nFor the entire series, as available:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aed989214ceaef14c2178460285a861fa30cdb18","amp;dn":"Inside+The+Medieval+Mind++SEX+2%2F4++2008+04+24+%28BBC+4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aed989214ceaef14c2178460285a861fa30cdb18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,217,137,33,76,234,239,20,194,23,132,96,40,90,134,31,163,12,219,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
