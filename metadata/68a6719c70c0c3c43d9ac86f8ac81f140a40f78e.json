Yamamoto--chief architect of the attack on Pearl Harbor--was visiting the forward Japanese bases at Bougainville, some 650 miles from the nearest U.S. base.His clash with U.S. fighters so far from their territory was more than simple bad luck--the pilots must have known where and when to find their target. We talk to the U.S. pilots and find out why the mission had to remain secret until war's end.\n\nFile Size ------- 349mb\nLength ---------- 43:55\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 30\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://phatwarez.thehashden.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://phatwarez.thehashden.com&lt;/a&gt;\nMade possible by your donations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68a6719c70c0c3c43d9ac86f8ac81f140a40f78e","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Mysterious+Death+Of+Admiral+Yamamoto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68a6719c70c0c3c43d9ac86f8ac81f140a40f78e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,166,113,156,112,192,195,196,61,154,200,111,138,200,31,20,10,64,247,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
