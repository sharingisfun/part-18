When Giancarlo, an Italian anarchist at the prisoner-of-war camp down the road, is assigned to work on the farm, she hopes that being kind to him will somehow influence her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treatment. What she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t anticipate is how dramatically Giancarlo will expand her outlook and self-knowledge.\n\nBut what most challenges Alice and her fellow townspeople is the utter foreignness of the thousand-plus Japanese inmates and their culture, which the camp commanders fatally misread. Mortified by being taken alive in battle and preferring a violent death to the shame of living, they plan an outbreak, to shattering and far-reaching effects on all the citizens around them.\n\nIn a career spanning half a century, Thomas Keneally has proved a master at exploring ordinary lives caught up in extraordinary events. With this profoundly gripping and thought-provoking novel, inspired by a notorious incident in New South Wales in 1944, he once again shows why he is celebrated as a writer who Ã¢â‚¬Å“looks into the heart of the human condition with a piercing intelligence that few can match.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d5e1116326a236caa6b6685cf94d59c9df1996f","amp;dn":"Thomas+Keneally+-+Shame+and+the+Captives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d5e1116326a236caa6b6685cf94d59c9df1996f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,94,17,22,50,106,35,108,170,107,102,133,207,148,213,156,157,241,153,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
