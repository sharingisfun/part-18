No one is more surprised than Sister Bear when she outswims every cub in every event--even the butterfly stroke! With visions of Bearlympics gold dancing in Papa Bear's furry head, he insists on being Sister's personal trainer as she prepares for the big meet. It's a decision that everyone in the Bear family will live to regret, for Papa--armed with his trusty clipboard, whistle, and stopwatch--will stop at nothing to achieve victory! Whoever said it doesn't matter whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game . . . that sure wasn't Papa!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9492d2420065af5e7a708619c3cb658f887313e8","amp;dn":"Berenstain+Bears-+The+Phenom+in+the+Family+%28retail+epub%2C+mobi%29+%7B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9492d2420065af5e7a708619c3cb658f887313e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,146,210,66,0,101,175,94,122,112,134,25,195,203,101,143,136,115,19,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
