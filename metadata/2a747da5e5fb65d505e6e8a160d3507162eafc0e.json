That combo made Hard Case Crime the perfect venue for this book, which is one of my favorites. I also loved the paperbacks I grew up with as a kid, and for that reason, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to hold off on e-publishing this one for the time being. Joyland will be coming out in paperback, and folks who want to read it will have to buy the actual book.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stephen King\n\nPaperback: 288 pages\nPublisher: Hard Case Crime; First Edition edition (June 4, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1781162646\nISBN-13: 978-1781162644","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a747da5e5fb65d505e6e8a160d3507162eafc0e","amp;dn":"Joyland+%28Hard+Case+Crime%29+by+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a747da5e5fb65d505e6e8a160d3507162eafc0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,116,125,165,229,251,101,213,5,230,232,161,96,211,80,113,98,234,252,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
