Their Elektra debut, Doolittle, reins in the noise in favor of pop songcraft and accessibility. Producer Gil Norton&amp;#039;s sonic sheen adds some polish, but Black Francis&amp;#039; tighter songwriting focuses the group&amp;#039;s attack. Doolittle&amp;#039;s most ferocious moments, like &quot;Dead,&quot; a visceral retelling of David and Bathsheba&amp;#039;s affair -- are more stylized than the group&amp;#039;s past outbursts. Meanwhile, their poppy side surfaces on the irresistible single &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; and the sweetly surreal love song &quot;La La Love You.&quot; The Pixies&amp;#039; arty, noisy weirdness mix with just enough hooks to produce gleefully demented singles like &quot;Debaser,&quot; -- inspired by Bunuel&amp;#039;s classic surrealist short Un Chien Andalou -- and &quot;Wave of Mutilation,&quot; their surfy ode to driving a car into the sea. Though Doolittle&amp;#039;s sound is cleaner and smoother than the Pixies&amp;#039; earlier albums, there are still plenty of weird, abrasive vignettes: the blankly psychotic &quot;There Goes My Gun,&quot; &quot;Crackity Jones,&quot; a song about a crazy roommate Francis had in Puerto Rico, and the nihilistic finale &quot;Gouge Away.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Tame,&quot; and &quot;I Bleed&quot; continue the Pixies&amp;#039; penchant for cryptic kink. But the album doesn&amp;#039;t just refine the Pixies&amp;#039; sound; they also expand their range on the brooding, wannabe spaghetti western theme &quot;Silver&quot; and the strangely theatrical &quot;Mr. Grieves.&quot; &quot;Hey&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven,&quot; on the other hand, stretch Francis&amp;#039; lyrical horizons: &quot;Monkey&quot;&amp;#039;s elliptical environmentalism and &quot;Hey&quot;&amp;#039;s twisted longing are the Pixies&amp;#039; versions of message songs and romantic ballads. Their most accessible album, Doolittle&amp;#039;s wide-ranging moods and sounds make it one of their most eclectic and ambitious. A fun, freaky alternative to most other late-&amp;#039;80s college rock, it&amp;#039;s easy to see why the album made the Pixies into underground rock stars.\n\nGood music NEVER gets old!\nEnjoy!\n/Duck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e326e4b184f51edc77051907cc00258b2b91721","amp;dn":"Indie+Classic%21%3A+Pixies-Dolittle+%5B1989%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e326e4b184f51edc77051907cc00258b2b91721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,50,110,75,24,79,81,237,199,112,81,144,124,192,2,88,178,185,23,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
