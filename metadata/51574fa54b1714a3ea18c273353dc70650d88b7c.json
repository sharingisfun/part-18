Clarke. The film deals with thematic elements of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and extraterrestrial life, and is notable for its scientific realism, pioneering special effects, ambiguous imagery that is open-ended to a point approaching surrealism, sound in place of traditional narrative techniques, and minimal use of dialogue.\n\nThe film has a memorable soundtrackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the result of the association that Kubrick made between the rotary motion of the satellites and the dancers of waltzes, which led him to use the The Blue Danube waltz by Johann Strauss II, and the famous symphonic poem Also sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss, to portray the philosophical evolution of Man theorized in Nietzsche's homonymous work.\n\nDespite initially receiving mixed reviews, 2001: A Space Odyssey is today recognized by many critics and audiences as one of the greatest films ever made; the 2002 Sight &amp; Sound poll of critics ranked it among the top ten films of all time. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, and received one for visual effects. In 1991, it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51574fa54b1714a3ea18c273353dc70650d88b7c","amp;dn":"2001%3A+A+Space+Odyssey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51574fa54b1714a3ea18c273353dc70650d88b7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,87,79,165,75,23,20,163,234,24,194,115,53,61,199,6,80,216,139,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
