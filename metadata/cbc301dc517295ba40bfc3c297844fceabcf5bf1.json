Even The Guiding Light\n\nIn 1972, after the release of &quot;In Search Of Amelia Earhart&quot;, \n\nPlainsong went into the studio to make another record. It was completed, white label copies were made, one of the tracks, &quot;Goodnight Lovin' Trail&quot;, was issued on an Elektra sampler, and then...nothing - for 33 years! Iain Matthews, who had grown to dislike the sessions, was offered a solo recording contract and jumped ship to USA - the project was abandoned and never released - until now. On CD2 of this issue, the &quot;lost&quot; lp is presented in all its glory. Iain and Andy did release some of the songs on solo projects, mostly re-worked, but this record is a real joy to hear. Goodnight Lovin' Trail&quot; is a moving song about the old West, Andy's version of John Hartford's &quot;First Girl I Loved&quot; is the golden glow of nostalgia encapsulated and &quot;All Around My \nGrandmother's Floor&quot; is nothing short of a masterpiece. Apart from all this, you have the legendary version of &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; that inspired the formation of the band in the first place plus several other tracks from radio sessions etc and, of course, the original ISOAE album. Everything you need from the heyday of this great and innovative band is here - it's been worth the wait\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbc301dc517295ba40bfc3c297844fceabcf5bf1","amp;dn":"Plainsong...Plainsong%281972%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbc301dc517295ba40bfc3c297844fceabcf5bf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,195,1,220,81,114,149,186,64,191,195,194,151,132,79,206,171,207,91,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
