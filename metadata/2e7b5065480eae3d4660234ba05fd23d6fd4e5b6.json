I would especially like to have the 1979 Year-End Countdown.&quot;\n\nWell, I have the Top 50 of 1979, the Top 40 of 1973 &amp; 1977, and the Top 100 of 1974, 1976, 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986. I haven't been through them to check for quality or do any editing. I plan to do that later in the year.\n\nI also have the Top 100 hits of 1978 and 1980 ready to go. I was waiting for the end of the year but Mom always said, &quot;Give the people what they want,&quot; so I will torrent those a few minutes after I get done here.\n\nSo here they are, just as I found them, all the year-end countdown shows that I have stashed away. I will give them a proper re-issue when the time comes.\n\nRocketMan999","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e7b5065480eae3d4660234ba05fd23d6fd4e5b6","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_Year_End_Countdowns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e7b5065480eae3d4660234ba05fd23d6fd4e5b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,123,80,101,72,14,174,61,70,96,35,75,160,95,210,61,111,212,229,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
