It is based on the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s successful Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis, updated to include the state of the art and latest developments in the field. The book enables readers to perform their analyses in a competent and up-to-date manner, bridging the gap to the difficult technical literature on the topic.\n\nSpringer: This is the new and totally revised edition of LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tkepohlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classic 1991 work. It provides a detailed introduction to the main steps of analyzing multiple time series, model specification, estimation, model checking, and for using the models for economic analysis and forecasting. The book now includes new chapters on cointegration analysis, structural vector autoregressions, cointegrated VARMA processes and multivariate ARCH models. The book bridges the gap to the difficult technical literature on the topic. It is accessible to graduate students in business and economics. In addition, multiple time series courses in other fields such as statistics and engineering may be based on it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b445971420a2c8bd2f17e24785c52fdac7191ad3","amp;dn":"New+Introduction+to+Multiple+Time+Series+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b445971420a2c8bd2f17e24785c52fdac7191ad3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,69,151,20,32,162,200,189,47,23,226,71,133,197,47,218,199,25,26,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
