Opening sequences and closing credits are included, cut into thier own segments for easy removal or just skipping over.\n\nThe source material was interlaced and not very good. The size has been reduced and video cleaned up, but is still far from top quality. This should be around the same quality level that the original aired cartoon was viewed at back in the 60's. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93d08b358d9811a390c42d47cd6f13442c8d41c4","amp;dn":"George+of+the+Jungle+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93d08b358d9811a390c42d47cd6f13442c8d41c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,208,139,53,141,152,17,163,144,196,45,71,205,111,19,68,44,141,65,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
