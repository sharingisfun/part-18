Stylistically speaking, Rogers mixes things up more than ever before on this album, moving from stomping Chicago blues to expressive, Ry Cooder-like moments to blues-rock and even singer/songwriter territory. Rogers' raw vocal style may be an acquired taste but his fleet-fingered slide skills are the connecting thread throughout Split Decision's many musical detours.\n\n[color=red]01.
