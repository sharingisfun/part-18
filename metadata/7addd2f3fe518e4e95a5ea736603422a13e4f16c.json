The holidays offer just the right combination of cold weather and family togetherness for cookie crafters to elevate their skills to showstopping new heights. With more than 60 new Christmas cookie designs, along with festive New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cookies and lovely Hanukkah treats, Cookie Craft Christmas delivers colorful inspiration to cookie decorators just when they need it most.\nEach spread features a full-page, close-up photograph of one cookie cutter shape with detailed decorating instructions on the facing page. Some pages feature one gloriously decorated cookie, while others might feature two or three interpretations of the same shape Ã¢â‚¬â€ ornaments in complementary colors, Christmas trees decorated in varying styles, or gingerbread men wearing a rainbow of colors and patterns. \nDecorating instructions are as simple as tinting cookie dough green before baking Christmas trees or as intricate as piping hair on a gingerbread grandma, creating a frilly pattern for her apron, and decorating her dress using a pretty feathering technique. Techniques are described in full in a Decorating Glossary, and cookie and icing recipes are included.\nFresh inspiration and fabulous decorating ideas fill the pages of this handy little sourcebook. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the perfect gift for anyone who has ever picked up a pastry bag.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7addd2f3fe518e4e95a5ea736603422a13e4f16c","amp;dn":"Christmas+Cookbook+Collection+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7addd2f3fe518e4e95a5ea736603422a13e4f16c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,221,210,243,254,81,142,78,149,165,234,115,102,3,66,42,19,228,241,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
