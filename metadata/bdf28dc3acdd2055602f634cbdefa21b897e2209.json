The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf28dc3acdd2055602f634cbdefa21b897e2209","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+-+Blue+-+8.200+-+English+-+Diskettes+-+with+fix-f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf28dc3acdd2055602f634cbdefa21b897e2209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,242,141,195,172,221,32,85,96,47,99,76,189,239,162,27,137,126,34,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
