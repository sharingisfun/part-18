Although this thriller has some lame attempts at humour, the photography and direction are first-rate.\n\nAs usual for spook stories of this era, the supernatural is debunked in favour of a crime story, turning it into a thriller. I have yet to see a genuine pre-1940 ghost movie, unless you count Rebecca.\n\nNonetheless, Powell's direction gives us a genuinely creepy atmosphere, plus we get to see some historical footage of the Ffestiniog Railway which I have ridden). Roy Kellino deserves a lot of credit as photographer, shooting a genuine lighthouse (Eddystone) must have been difficult - you can feel the claustrophobia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828cba34de0a19c8a6165895e6c6e069abe5d39c","amp;dn":"The+Phantom+Light+%28Michael+Powell%2C+1936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828cba34de0a19c8a6165895e6c6e069abe5d39c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,140,186,52,222,10,25,200,166,22,88,149,230,198,224,105,171,229,211,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
