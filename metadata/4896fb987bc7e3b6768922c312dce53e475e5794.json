The growing complexity of embedded systems and the emerging trend to interconnections between them lead to new challenges. Intelligent solutions are necessary to overcome these challenges and to provide reliable and secure systems to the customer under a strict time and financial budget.\nSolutions on Embedded Systems documents results of several innovative approaches that provide intelligent solutions in embedded systems. The objective is to present mature approaches, to provide detailed information on the implementation and to discuss the results obtained.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4896fb987bc7e3b6768922c312dce53e475e5794","amp;dn":"Solutions+on+Embedded+Systems+%282011%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4896fb987bc7e3b6768922c312dce53e475e5794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,150,251,152,123,199,227,182,118,137,34,195,18,220,229,62,71,94,87,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
