The guidelines in this book help you through the transition by demonstrating which programming practices conform to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Drupal way,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and which donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re familiar with PHP, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll quickly learn how to take advantage of the powerful Drupal API.\n\n- Get a complete overview of Drupal, including Drupal core and add-on modules and themes\n- Learn DrupalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basic programming principles, such as the ability to customize behavior and output with hooks\n- Discover common Drupal programming mistakesÃ¢â‚¬â€and why hacking is one of them\n- Explore specific areas where you can put your programming skills to work\n- Learn programming tips and tools to help you perfect and debug your applications\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
