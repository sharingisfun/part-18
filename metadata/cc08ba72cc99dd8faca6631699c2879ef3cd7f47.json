Underneath the surface of Hall's seemingly cheerful melodies is always a bummed-out lyric or two, and he wastes no time on Deception. Amidst the jolly xylophones of &quot;From Dawn to Distraction,&quot; the second track on the LP, Hall sings, &quot;Nothing is enough/In a world without love.&quot; &quot;Digging It Deep&quot; emulates the same formula: hook listeners with a danceable beat while hurling unsettling revelations like &quot;Oh how I wish I love the human race/Oh how I wish I had a pretty face.&quot; There's probably no one who is having as much fun being depressed than Hall. While Deception is slicker than the Colourfield's debut album, Virgins and Philistines, Hall's songwriting hasn't softened; he can still tell sad stories with acid-tongued wit and a barrel full of empathy. On the haunting &quot;Miss Texas 1967,&quot; Hall narrates a tale of faded beauty with deeply felt compassion. With its lovely acoustic guitars, &quot;Miss Texas 1967&quot; more closely resembles the intimate sound of Virgins and Philistines than Deception's glossy production. The robotic percussion and blaring horns of the band's cover of Sly &amp; the Family Stone's &quot;Running Away&quot; might revolt indie pop purists with no tolerance for '80s dance music; however, it nicely shows off Hall's stylistic range, and &quot;Goodbye Sun Valley&quot; is a rousing homage to cabaret. Deception may wallow in its misery, but at least it does so with a smile on its face.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc08ba72cc99dd8faca6631699c2879ef3cd7f47","amp;dn":"The+Colourfield+-+Deception+%5B1987%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc08ba72cc99dd8faca6631699c2879ef3cd7f47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,8,186,114,204,153,221,143,172,166,99,22,153,194,135,158,243,205,127,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
