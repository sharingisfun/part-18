The book covers such topics as structured shapes, solid geometry, networking and databases, physical computing, image processing, graphic user interfaces, and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a82e15de0d58bf84461dcfb9a3388b6ecf4ba83e","amp;dn":"Algorithms+for+Visual+Design+2009+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a82e15de0d58bf84461dcfb9a3388b6ecf4ba83e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,46,21,222,13,88,191,132,70,29,207,185,163,56,139,110,207,75,168,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
