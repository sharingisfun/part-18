It is, by far, the most bizarre adaptation of this fairytale I have ever seen. It is also one of my childhood favorites, though it was labeled by adults as creepy or weird.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:350fbc3fed6dd47fb28114f2abab46da82091080","amp;dn":"Jack+and+the+Beanstalk+-+1974","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"350fbc3fed6dd47fb28114f2abab46da82091080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,15,188,63,237,109,212,127,178,129,20,242,171,171,70,218,130,9,16,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
