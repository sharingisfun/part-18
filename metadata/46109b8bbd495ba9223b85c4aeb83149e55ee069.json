The park's ospreys return from West Africa to breed, two male black grouse fight for the right to mate, and an eagle chick waits patiently for its parents to return with food\r\n\r\n2)  Summer \r\nIt's June at Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, and with the warm temperatures come rich pickings. However, for the newborn the summer months are crucial as they learn to fight, find food and avoid predators. Will an orphaned hen harrier chick, young red squirrels, Eurasian beaver kits and two rare osprey chicks make it through to the autumn?\r\n\r\n3)  Autumn \r\nDocumenting autumn events at Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, a time for the red deer rut, when stags battle for the right to breed. Meanwhile, two osprey chicks, Lonaig and Murrin, begin their first 3,000-mile migration to West Africa, and cameras also follow the journey of Atlantic salmon and the birth of adders, the UK's only venomous snakes.\r\n\r\n4)  Winter \r\nThe winter is mild and wet, which is good news for some but bad news for others at Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park. Cameras follow red deer who are forced to higher ground, while salmon have gone six months without food. Meanwhile, mountain hares turn a conspicuous white to help them hide from predators, but with no snow they have become easy targets for hungry eagles.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/87/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0e/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/69/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ca/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/Loch-Lomond-A-Year-in-the-Wild-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CAVLC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3147 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: German/English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.locatetv.com/tv/loch-lomond-a-year-in-the-wild/season-1/9042172","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46109b8bbd495ba9223b85c4aeb83149e55ee069","amp;dn":"Loch+Lomond+A+Year+In+The+Wild+1of4+Spring+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46109b8bbd495ba9223b85c4aeb83149e55ee069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,16,155,139,189,73,91,169,34,59,133,196,174,184,49,73,229,94,224,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
