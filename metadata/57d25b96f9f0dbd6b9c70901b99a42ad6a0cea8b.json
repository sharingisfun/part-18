The era of metal has begun.\n\nAfter devastating Runeterra with their ear-splitting riffs and ground-pounding rhythms, the metal monolith that is Pentakill has finally reached our shores. Smite and Ignite, their debut album, is available now for free on PentakillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website and can be picked up or streamed through a bunch of websites and apps.\n\nAnd because Riot cannot appease us themselves, here's the album in lossless FLAC (v1.3.1, level 7). Audio is exactly what was provided by Riot to digital distributors.\n\nThey have applied a lowpass filter after dithering, which is a real head-scratcher to me, but I don't get paid to make those kinds of decisions. But then again, it's Riot, so nothing they do should really surprise me. It may in fact be lossy audio that they sent out, that wouldn't surprise me either.\n\nSome streaming services label the release date as May 26, 2014. I used the date Riot announced the download in the tagging: June 2, 2014. I also lightly altered some tagging, which makes more sense than what was provided by Riot.\n\nTrack list:\n\nDeathfire Grasp\nOhmwrecker\nLast Whisper\nThe Hex Core\nThe Prophecy\nThornmail\nOrb Of Winter\n\nHigh-resolution cover art also included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57d25b96f9f0dbd6b9c70901b99a42ad6a0cea8b","amp;dn":"Pentakill+-+Smite+and+Ignite+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57d25b96f9f0dbd6b9c70901b99a42ad6a0cea8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,210,91,150,249,240,219,214,185,199,9,1,185,154,66,173,106,12,234,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
