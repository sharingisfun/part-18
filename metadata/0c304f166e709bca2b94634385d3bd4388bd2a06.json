Now Naifeh and Smith have written another\ntour de forceÃ¢â‚¬â€an exquisitely detailed, compellingly readable,\nand ultimately heartbreaking portrait of creative genius\nVincent van Gogh. Working with the full cooperation of the\nVan Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, Naifeh and Smith have accessed\na wealth of previously untapped materials. While drawing\nliberally from the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famously eloquent letters, they\nhave also delved into hundreds of unpublished family\ncorrespondences, illuminating with poignancy the wanderings\nof Van GoghÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled, restless soul. Naifeh and Smith bring\na crucial understanding to the larger-than-life mythology of\nthis great artistÃ¢â‚¬â€his early struggles to find his place in\nthe world; his intense relationship with his brother Theo;\nhis impetus for turning to brush and canvas; and his move to\nProvence, where in a brief burst of incandescent productivity\nhe painted some of the best-loved works in Western art.\n\nVan Gogh: The Life\nBy: Gregory White Smith\nISBN13: 9781588360472\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 2510","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c304f166e709bca2b94634385d3bd4388bd2a06","amp;dn":"Van+Gogh+The+Life+by+Gregory+White+Smith.+EPUB+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c304f166e709bca2b94634385d3bd4388bd2a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,48,79,22,110,112,155,202,43,148,99,67,133,211,189,67,136,189,42,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
