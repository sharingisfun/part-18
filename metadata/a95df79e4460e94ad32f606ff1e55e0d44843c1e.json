Characters on the show were mostly named after pieces of sound equipment, including rising star Mike Flex (Perkins), fading star Mike Channel (Deayton), &quot;children's favourite&quot; &quot;Uncle&quot; Mike Stand (Stevens) and the food-obsessed Anna Daptor (Atkinson-Wood). Also on the station's staff were the incomprehensible Nigel Pry (Pope), the incompetent Martin Brown (Stevens), the carefully enunciated &quot;oh-so-daring&quot; Mike Hunt (Pope), brusque owner Sir Norman Tonsil (Deayton), Norwegian correspondent Oivind Vinstra (Perkins), whose command of English was negligible, and Head of Religious Affairs the Right Reverend Reverend Wright (Deayton), who had a mail-order bride. Other regular characters were unsympathetic agony aunt Anna Rabies (Atkinson-Wood) and singing doctor Philip Percygo (Pope).\n\n \n \n\nOther parodic elements included over-the-top jingles presenting the station telephone number for phone ins and introducing the commercials which included an exchange between Mary and June and a slot for Honest Ron (&quot;the others are a con) (Stevens). The incompetent Radio Active Drama Repertory Company usually gave a performance, and episodes concluded with a handback designed to embarrass the following BBC continuity announcer.\n\n \n\n\nCast:\nAnna Dapter (Helen Atkinson-Wood)\nMike Channel (Angus Deayton)\nMike Flex (Geoffrey Perkins)\nMartin Brown (Michael Fenton-Stevens)\nMike Hunt (Philip Pope)\nNigel Pry (Philip Pope)\nOivind Vinstra (Geoffrey Perkins)\nSir Norman Tonsil (Angus Deayton)\nUncle Mike Stand (Michael Fenton-Stevens)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRadio Active - S01 - E00 - The Oxford Review\nRadio Active - S01 - E01 - The Late Show With Mike Channel\nRadio Active - S01 - E02 - Bedrock - The Early Morning Breakfast Show With Mike Flex\nRadio Active - S01 - E03 - The Midday Show With Anna Daptor\nRadio Active - S01 - E04 - The Radio Active Roadshow\nRadio Active - S01 - E05 - What's News\nRadio Active - S01 - E06 - The Radio Active Awards\nRadio Active - S01 - E07 - The Hee Bee Gee Bees Story ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a95df79e4460e94ad32f606ff1e55e0d44843c1e","amp;dn":"Radio+Active+-+S01+to+07+-+Radio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a95df79e4460e94ad32f606ff1e55e0d44843c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,93,247,158,68,96,233,74,211,47,96,111,241,229,94,13,68,132,60,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
