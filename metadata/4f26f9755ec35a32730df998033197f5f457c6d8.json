Rex and the Crater of Doom \nBy Walter Alvarez\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\n\n\nSixty-five million years ago a gigantic comet or asteroid as big as Mount Everest slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula, creating an explosion on impact equivalent to the detonation of a hundred million hydrogen bombs. It produced a cloud of roiling debris that blackened the sky for months as well as other geologic disasters--and triggered the demise of Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nWe know what happened largely because Walter Alvarez-synthesizing the findings of experts from a variety of scientific fields-has written a gripping story of the decades-long search for the cause of the dinosaurs' extinction. Painstakingly assembling clues from the Italian Apennines and the depths of the Pacific and presenting them with the excitement of a great novel, T. rex and the Crater of Doom is a book of undeniable importance and irresistible appeal by a major figure in contemporary science.\n\n\nRunning Time: 2:45:00\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f26f9755ec35a32730df998033197f5f457c6d8","amp;dn":"Walter+Alvarez+-+T+Rex+and+the+Crater+of+Doom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f26f9755ec35a32730df998033197f5f457c6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,38,249,117,94,195,90,50,115,13,249,152,3,49,151,245,244,87,198,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
