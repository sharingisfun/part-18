Anyway, if you've \n\nbeen following her story, this is yet another collection of well-crafted, often \n\nhumorous tunes detailing love, her love life, her love life, her love life, \n\ndancing with Joey Ramone, and the very politicized &quot;Girls Got It Bad.&quot; I left \n\nout a few of the songs about her love life, too. The great thing about her \n\nthough is that she doesn't sound self-indulgent with that stuff - her \n\nsoul-searching and (often brutally) honest lyrics are things that I can't \n\nimagine anyone who's had experience with adult relationships failing to \n\nconnect with. So if here she's less funny than she can be, she still delivers her \n\nusual spate of catchy, intelligent tunes and adds a few to the next greatest hits \n\ncollection someone decides to make out of her catalog. I love the \n\nBeatles-isms of &quot;So You Know Now,&quot; I love everything about &quot;The Trouble \n\nWith Jeanie,&quot; I think the sly humor of &quot;I Don't Wanna Talk About Love No \n\nMore&quot; is as good as any set of lyrics she's written, I love that she has the \n\nnerve to drop Dustin Hoffman's name in a song just so she can have a \n\nrhyme (n.b.: &quot;often&quot;). In short, she's a great talent, and if this doesn't knock \n\nme out, it's still a worthy effort from my favorite relative-unknown out there.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/23/3412/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bece586dda9e252adc82a7b7b5e6b2d84b5b458c","amp;dn":"Amy+Rigby...Little+Fugitive%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bece586dda9e252adc82a7b7b5e6b2d84b5b458c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,206,88,109,218,158,37,42,220,130,167,183,181,230,178,216,75,91,69,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
