Recorded quite early in the days of the live LP, the album captured Vaughan at her best and most relaxed, stretching out on a set of late-night torch songs and ballads. \n\n\nWith a trio including Jimmy Jones on piano, Roy Haynes on drums, and Richard Davis on bass, Vaughan is simply captivating, easily disproving the notion that, to be entertaining, singers needed inventive arrangements and multiple voices (instrumental or otherwise) behind them. \n\n\nHer unerring sense of rhythm carries her through every song on this set, whether the occasion calls for playfulness and wit (&quot;Thou Swell,&quot; &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;) or a world-wise melancholia (&quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot;). Her accompanists are a valuable anchor, with Haynes' drumming just as precise as Sassy's vocals and Jones' piano solos adding additional vitality. \n\nIncludes the reissueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bonus tracks (#10-20)\n\nDigitally remastered by Kiyoshi Tokiwa.\n\nPersonnel: Sarah Vaughan (vocals); Jimmy Jones (piano); Richard Davis (bass); Roy Haynes (drums)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n1.
