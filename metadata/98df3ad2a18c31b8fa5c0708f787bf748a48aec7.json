Another alias he uses is Noto. He is a member of the music groups Signal (with Frank Bretschneider, AKA Komet and Olaf Bender, AKA Byetone) and Cyclo. (with Ryoji Ikeda).\n\nNicolai was born in Karl-Marx-Stadt, East Germany. He has created music from overlooked sounds ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the noises of modems and telephones for example.\n\nCarsten Nicolai also works as a visual artist. Using the principles of Cymatics he visualizes sound. NicolaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s practice is formed by a convergence of sound, painting and sculpture that results in installations exploring the idea of creativity filtered through modularized systems and codes. His music features prominently in his art. NicolaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work exposes the limitations, and potential beauty and creativity, possible within strict logical systems.\n\nNicolai plays with the rules of physicality. Sound is changed and evolved into time and space and transformed by looping oscillators and tone generators. Through these processes the essence of pure electricity is made audible. He works without sequencers, but mathematically edits his work to give his compositions precise rhythmic structures. Clicks and glitches are not used as ornamental additions to the compositions but make up the essential elements of the work and these sound sources are applied to the rhythmic groove of Hip-Hop and R&amp;B. The sounds of electronic information transmission such as fax tones, modem sounds and telephone pops and clicks are sampled and organised into loops to which Nicolai adds longer electronic tones in the background and foreground as the piece progresses.\nCarsten Nicolai composed and performed on German ensemble Zeitkratzer's LP electronics (2008)\n\nHe has recently written an opera in collaboration with Michael Nyman, Sparkie: Cage and Beyond.\n\n\nTracklist\nTransform - Modules 1-10   \nm 01 5:50  \nm 02 3:37  \nm 03 10:09  \nm 04 6:26  \nm 05 4:43  \nm 06 5:36  \nm 07 4:58  \nm 08 5:27  \nm 09 7:45  \nm 10 2:41  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98df3ad2a18c31b8fa5c0708f787bf748a48aec7","amp;dn":"Alva+Noto+%5B2001%5D+Transform","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98df3ad2a18c31b8fa5c0708f787bf748a48aec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,223,58,210,161,140,49,184,250,92,7,8,247,135,191,116,138,72,174,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
