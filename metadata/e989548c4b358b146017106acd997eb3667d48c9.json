So hold your nose, kiss the babies, and just think how good you would look on a stamp. A stamp, for mailÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ No, not email, mail. Never mind, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explain later.\n\nNow, before we go into your media responsibilities, you must understand the true history of political power, so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t accidentally act on the naÃƒÂ¯ve idealism you are required to project to the general public.\n\nAbout the author:\nStefan Molyneux is a Canadian philosopher, author, speaker, and host of Freedomain Radio. Molyneux's areas of focus include libertarian political philosophy, voluntaryism based on the strict application of the non-aggression principle, secular ethics, strong atheism, cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), history, non-violent parenting, and familial relationship issues. He has written and self-published eight non-fiction books, and his essays have been published on libertarian websites such as LewRockwell.com and antiwar.com. He is a frequent public speaker at political and technology conferences and has appeared on television, radio, and podcasts to discuss his views. His online philosophy show, Freedomain Radio, has independently produced over 1,500 videos and 2,700 podcasts as of June 2014.
