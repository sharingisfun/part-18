Insult to injury, the serial key you get on your CD isn&amp;#039;t validated against their database if you bought from Woot.  So, this is the karmic wheel turning.\n\nNeat Receipts CD, v3, full\n\nIt will NOT install on a 64-bit OS.  You are welcome to try, and encouraged to tear it up and rebuild it for a 64-bit install.\n\nGood luck, hope this helps someone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73221721cf64b60185201fcb76d6e3c1c5747776","amp;dn":"neat+receipts+full+version+v3+sp1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73221721cf64b60185201fcb76d6e3c1c5747776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,34,23,33,207,100,182,1,133,32,31,203,118,214,227,193,197,116,119,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
