He sets out with two horses, a wagonful of belongings, his five children, a 15-year-old orphan wife, and a few land warrants for his future homestead. When Daniel suddenly trades a horse for a young slave, Onesimus, it sets in motion a struggle in his conscience that will taint his life forever, and sets in motion a chain of events that lead to two murders and the family's strange relationship with a runaway slave named Bett.\n\nStripped down and as hard-edged as the realities of pioneer life, Spalding's writing is nothing short of stunning, as it instantly envelops the reader in the world and time of the novel, and follows the lives of unforgettable characters. Inspired by stories of the author's own ancestors, The Purchase is a resonant, powerful and timeless novel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0adc245fa654331eb702b93b5aa581ae8ddfe78","amp;dn":"The+Purchase+-+Linda+Spalding+%28EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0adc245fa654331eb702b93b5aa581ae8ddfe78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,173,194,69,250,101,67,49,235,112,43,147,181,170,88,26,232,221,254,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
