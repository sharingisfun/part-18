A great success when it was first released, the music itself is highly evocative of the 1980s, and fans of McVie\\\\\\&amp;#039;s compositions for Fleetwood Mac will not be disappointed. As usual, her keen sense for a good tune is evident, as is wonderful writing (especially with Todd Sharp) and well-crafted sound. Featuring guest work by Lindsey Buckingham, Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood, this album will delight McVie/Fleetwood Mac aficionados, and appeal to anyone who can remember the dizzy pleasure of 80s pop music at its best. \n(Amazon Review).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1246af1953b5d1218a7b596e07fa4a880012ba68","amp;dn":"Christine+McVie+-+Christine+Mcvie+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1246af1953b5d1218a7b596e07fa4a880012ba68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,70,175,25,83,181,209,33,138,123,89,110,7,250,74,136,0,18,186,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
