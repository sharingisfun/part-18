The puzzler is challenged to change one matchstick pattern into an-other in a specific number of moves. Matchstick puzzles can be simple or complicated, and they can while away a minute or a half-hour. Here are over 50 new and unusual examples of these tantalizers. Also included are two elaborate matchstick structures that can be built. You can try these puzzles immediately â€” no equipment except an ordinary box of matches is necessary.\r\n\r\nNOTE - I have included 2 PDF versions here. One is dowmloaded from the net as it is. The second smaller version is converted by me from DJVU and OCRed.\r\n \nhttp://s23.postimg.org/cyumrhwzv/Creative_Puzzles_of_the_World.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa328f32bcbed149ddae08be4b3e02875983bd0","amp;dn":"Creative+Puzzles+of+the+World+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa328f32bcbed149ddae08be4b3e02875983bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,163,40,243,43,203,237,20,157,218,224,139,228,179,224,40,117,152,59,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
