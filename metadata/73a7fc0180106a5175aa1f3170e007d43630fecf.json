It is a short episode, shown as part of Comic Relief's Red Nose Day in 1988.\n\nThe 15-minute episode was set in November 1648, during the last days of the Civil War. Sir Edmund Blackadder and his servant, Baldrick, are the last two men loyal to the defeated King Charles I of England (played by Stephen Fry, portrayed as a soft-spoken, ineffective, slightly dim character, with the voice and mannerisms of Charles I's namesake, the current Prince of Wales). However, due to a misunderstanding between Oliver Cromwell (guest-star Warren Clarke) and Baldrick, the King is arrested and sent to the Tower of London. The rest of the episode revolves around Blackadder's attempts to save the king, as well as improve his standing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73a7fc0180106a5175aa1f3170e007d43630fecf","amp;dn":"Blackadder+-+The+Cavalier+Years+%28Comic+Relief+Special+1988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73a7fc0180106a5175aa1f3170e007d43630fecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,167,252,1,128,16,106,81,117,170,31,49,112,224,7,212,54,48,254,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
