The author has succeeded in making that knowledge accessible, entertaining, and useful to everyone who likes to play and win.\n\nThe information applies to such diverse and popular games as Roulette, MonopolyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, Chess, Go, numerous card games, and many more. He reviews the mathematical foundations, probability, combinatorics, and mathematical game theory, the field that won John Nash of A Beautiful Mind the Nobel Prize, and emphasizes the implementation of these techniques so that players can put them to work immediately.\n\nAn extensive bibliography and sections describing the historical developments are welcome features to put the subject in a broader context","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb1fa1c2964f5a93e24ab28be6817d4d0a2635b","amp;dn":"Luck%2C+Logic+and+White+Lies+-+The+Mathematics+of+Games-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb1fa1c2964f5a93e24ab28be6817d4d0a2635b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,177,250,28,41,100,245,169,62,36,171,40,190,104,23,212,208,162,99,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
