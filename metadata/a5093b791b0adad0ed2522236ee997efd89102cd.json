This was the first time that a DJ was asked to perform for a ceremony at the Olympics. Recognizing one of their own, the Dutch  team came up to the booth while TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto was performing this set. All of the songs on this track are original songs composed by TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto except for Adagio for Strings, which is his own remix of Samuel Barber's piece by the same name (the remix was also influenced by William Orbit's original electronic remix of the song in 1999), and &quot;Athena&quot;, which is also a remix of Albinoni's Adagio in G minor..\n\n\n\nTrackList:\n\n\n1. \t&quot;Heroes&quot;   \t                  8:36\n2. \t&quot;Breda 8pm (DJ Montana Edit)&quot;     6:43\n3. \t&quot;Ancient History&quot;   \t          6:06\n4. \t&quot;Traffic&quot;   \t                  4:13\n5. \t&quot;Euphoria&quot;   \t                  6:05\n6. \t&quot;Athena&quot;   \t                  6:17\n7. \t&quot;Olympic Flame&quot;   \t          5:34\n8. \t&quot;Lethal Industry&quot;   \t          4:36\n9. \t&quot;Coming Home&quot;   \t          6:28\n10. \t&quot;Adagio for Strings&quot;              5:57\n11. \t&quot;Victorious&quot;              \t  4:38\n12. \t&quot;Forever Today&quot;   \t          7:06\n\n\n\nInfo:\n\n\nReleased:   September 7, 2004 \n\nGenre:      Trance\n\nLabel: \t    Black Hole Recordings\n\nProducer:   TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto\n\n\nPurchase link:\n\nitunes.apple.com/no/album/parade-of-the-athletes/id114192746\n\n\nSoftware used:\n\nAshampoo Burning Studio 10 BETA\n\n\nThis album brought to you by JamieX.
