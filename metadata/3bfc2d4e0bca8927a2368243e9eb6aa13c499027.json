We all know that a good hearty salad is good for you. However, due to everyones busy demanding schedules, finding the time to prepare a good salad isn't always possible.\n\nYes, you can get salad in many fast food restaurants; unfortunately, most fast food salads are either not fresh, contains processed fillers, or their dressing contains more calories than their burgers.\n\nWhat most people don't know is that many fast food restaurants actually spray their salads with a substance made of propylene glycol to make their lettuce and other vegetables appear fresh, when they could actually be up to 3 days old! So all these reasons really defeat the purpose of trying to eat healthy.\n\nLucky for you, I am about to reveal an ingenious way to prepare a tasty, mouth watering and healthy salad in a mason jar that can last for up to 7 days - without the unwanted chemical spray.\n\nIf you download our uploads, please make sure you seed them till atleast 1:1 ratio. We all work very hard to get this stuff. We'll all greatly appreciate some help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bfc2d4e0bca8927a2368243e9eb6aa13c499027","amp;dn":"Salads+To+Go+-+Arnel+Ricafranca+%28Epub%2BPDF%2BMobi%2Bazw3%29+LittleFairy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bfc2d4e0bca8927a2368243e9eb6aa13c499027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,252,45,78,11,202,137,39,162,54,130,67,233,235,106,161,60,73,144,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
