His early paintings were signed &quot;JAG,&quot; &quot;J. A. Grimshaw,&quot; or &quot;John Atkinson Grimshaw,&quot; though he finally settled on &quot;Atkinson Grimshaw.&quot; Grimshaw's paintings depicted the contemporary world but eschewed the dirty and depressing aspects of industrial towns. Shipping on the Clyde, a depiction of Glasgow's Victorian docks, is a lyrically beautiful evocation of the industrial era. Grimshaw transcribed the fog and mist so accurately as to capture the chill in the damp air, and the moisture penetrating the heavy clothes of the few figures awake in the misty early morning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c099770c04afdef9b8ad10928c03c4229bfef9bc","amp;dn":"John+Atkinson+Grimshaw+ArtWorks+%281836+%26ndash%3B+1893%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c099770c04afdef9b8ad10928c03c4229bfef9bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,153,119,12,4,175,222,249,184,173,16,146,140,3,196,34,155,254,249,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
