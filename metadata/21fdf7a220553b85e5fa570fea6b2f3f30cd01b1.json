On sheer strength of its concept, the natural aura surrounding the artists, the harsh realities that we love watching from a distance and discussing in coffee shops. TINGYA is a story of child who portrays the world we are unable to see, accept or fathom.\n\nA brilliant effort by the debut director Mangesh Hadawale and the sensitive producer that he had in Ravi Rai, this insightful and perceptive portrayal seems to have caught the attention of juries at various festivals.\n\nPresented by One More Thought Productions TINGYA won  two awards at the recently concluded Pune Film Festival.  It has been awarded the BEST INTERNATIONAL MARATHI FILM AWARD by the eminent national and international Jury.\n\nThe Award was presented by BollywoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s noted film director and Producer Shri Subhash Ghai. Award was received by Ravi Rai of Small Town Boy Productions.\n\nAnother prominent award goes to the little boy Sharad Goekar who plays TINGYA. This village boy who comes from the same surrounding, an absolutely non-actor bagged the Critics Awards for Best Actor Award. This Special jury award was given to Master Sharad Goyekar for his excellent performance as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTingyaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by popular actress Rati Agnihotri.\n\nThrilled on receiving these awards Parvez Damania said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAzam Khan, Ravi Rai and  myself at One more Thought Entertainment, are thrilled at this appreciation for our first film together. Our aim is to produce not just commercial movies but also contribute towards such meaningful sensitive cinema. It reinforces our faith and motivates us further to explore such subjects.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSpeaking on the awards, Ravi Rai, the producer said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI realized way back that apart from entertainment, cinema has other wings as well. Creativity for me personally is something that disturbs me. It is born out of a disturbed mind. The life of farmers in India right now is in a phase that is very dark, tough and turbulent. Approximately every 9th hour a farmer commits suicide. The newspapers reports disturbed me everyday. I wanted to make a film..What? and How? I never knew till Mangesh came up with this subject and I knew I was doing it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTingya is a painstakingly meticulous film about an emotional love story between a bull and a boy. It inquires through Tingya's innocence the validity of existence. It queries the order of the alive and breathing. Is it the man, animal, bird and the sea or vice versa? Who regulates and classifies the categories?\n\nAwards and rewards for TINGYA\n\n- Best Intl Marathi Film Award  at Pune Film Festival\n- Best Actor Awards for the 7 yr old child artist at Pune Film Festival\n- Part of 21 films selected for Indian Panorama section in International Film Festival of India\n- Selected for screening in the category for DirectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s First/Se\n\n\nITS WITH SUBTITLES\n\neNJOY ALL MARATHI people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21fdf7a220553b85e5fa570fea6b2f3f30cd01b1","amp;dn":"TingYa+Marathi+Movie+%5BTechnodiv%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21fdf7a220553b85e5fa570fea6b2f3f30cd01b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,253,247,162,32,85,59,133,229,250,87,15,234,107,47,63,48,205,1,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
