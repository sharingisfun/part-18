Find out more from NUKE Product Manager Jon Wadelton in our Sneak Peek video.\n\nNUKE 8 highlights\nComplete creative control\nNUKE 8 features a new Text node that lets artists compose, edit and animate directly in the viewer, and a huge update to the Dope Sheet that gives artists powerful timeline viewing of scripts. In addition NUKE 8 features a new intelligent in-context help system as well as a range of artist friendly color controls including: an intuitive in-panel Color Wheel, new Match Grade node (exclusive to NUKEX), a Pixel Analyzer and Scopes for viewing the most detailed levels of color data.\n\nThe cutting-edge in compositing\nNUKEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Camera Tracker has been redefined to make set solves even more simple within one integrated environment and the Model Builder now features UV creation to give artists even greater 3D control, these features (both exclusive to NUKEX) combine to make environment work fast and efficient all inside of NUKE.\n\nNUKE 8 also features a number of new 3D tools, including Viewer Capture that allows artists to flipbook images from the viewer, a new Edit Geo node for greater control, Particle Cache node to speed up rendering times and Wireframe Shader node for increased control over projection mapping. NUKEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Scanline Renderer benefits from Deep Output to enhance the Deep Compositing workflow and overall speed and performance are improved with the addition of OpenEXR 2.0 multi-part image read and write support, Alembic 1.5 and Planar Rendering.\n\nPlugged further into the pipeline\nWith NUKE 8 developers can now write their own image processing operations inside of NUKE using the new Blink Script node to ensure the best possible performance from their team's hardware. The new Import NUKE function lets developers use NUKE as a module in any Python interpreter, and developers of C++ plugins can now output planar data in more flexible ways thanks to the new Planar Rendering Framework.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n-Windows 7 64-bit and Windows 8 64-bit\n-To take advantage of GPU acceleration, you must have:\n-an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 2. 0 (Fermi) or above. A list of the compute capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs is\navailable at www. nvidia. co. uk/object/cuda_gpus_uk. html\n- graphics drivers capable of running CUDA 4. 2 or above.\n- On Windows CUDA graphics drivers are bundled with the regular drivers for your NVIDIA GPU. Drivers from April 2012 onward support CUDA 4. 2.\n-5 GB disk space available for caching and temporary files\n-At least 1 GB RAM\n-Display with at least 1280 x 1024 pixel resolution and 24-bit color\n-Graphics card with at least 512 MB of video memory and driver support for OpenGL 2.0. Tested Graphics Cards for Linux are Quadro K4000 and Quadro K6000\n-To enable optional GPU acceleration of Viewer processing, you need OpenGL 2.0 with support for floating point textures and GLSL.\n\nTo enable NUKEX 8.0 to calculate certain nodes using the GPU, you need to have:\n-A NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 1.1 or above. A list of the compute capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs is available here. \n-Graphics drivers capable of running CUDA 4.0 or above. On Windows these are the normal graphics drivers for your NVIDIA GPU: Windows 275.36 (released June 20111.19) or later.\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke-product-family/nukex/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke-product-family/nukex/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91221a88712a5ee61ce5484a036119f201b436cb","amp;dn":"The+Foundry+NUKEX+8.0v1+%28Win+64+bit%29+%28crack+XForce%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91221a88712a5ee61ce5484a036119f201b436cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,34,26,136,113,42,94,230,28,229,72,74,3,97,25,242,1,180,54,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
