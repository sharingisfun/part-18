Now, representatives from both sides attempt to negotiate a peace treaty-but deception by the Sith puts the Jedi in an unfortunate position.\n\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic #4-6 (Blood of the Empire #1-3)\n\nScript:  Alexander Freed\nPencils:  Dave Ross\nInks:  Mark McKenna\nColors:  Michael Atiyeh\nLettering:  Michael Heisler\nCover Art:  Benjamin CarrÃƒÂ©\n\nAfter hundreds of years, the Sith Empire has returned to the galaxy, determined to crush the Republic that sent them into exile. For young Sith Teneb Kel, it is his only chance to rise above his lowly beginnings as a slave and prove his worth to the Dark Council. Yet their mission for him is unexpected. He will not hunt Jedi, but rather a fellow Sith-the Emperor's apprentice!

Unfortunately, he is the only one who can guide Theron on his mission. Quickly, Theron's hands are full with Zho, a troublesome thief, and the Sith who never should have let that old Jedi return to the Republic!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e647ead8957bde784476c7a7306593b83dd2e01","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+The+Old+Republic+%26amp%3B+The+Lost+Suns+%282010-2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e647ead8957bde784476c7a7306593b83dd2e01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,100,126,173,137,87,189,231,132,71,108,122,115,6,89,59,131,221,46,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
