Or what holds a spinning top upright? Or whether it is possible to feel the Earth's rotation in an airplane? Why Cats Land on Their Feet is a compendium of paradoxes and puzzles that readers can solve using their own physical intuition. And the surprising answers to virtually all of these astonishing paradoxes can be arrived at with no formal knowledge of physics.\n\nMark Levi introduces each physical problem, sometimes gives a hint or two, and then fully explains the solution. Here readers can test their critical-thinking skills against a whole assortment of puzzles and paradoxes involving floating and diving, sailing and gliding, gymnastics, bike riding, outer space, throwing a ball from a moving car, centrifugal force, gyroscopic motion, and, of course, falling cats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d29480b764afac6cec6382edb2ace6ed7a290f3","amp;dn":"Why+Cats+Land+on+Their+Feet%3A+And+76+Other+Physical+Paradoxes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d29480b764afac6cec6382edb2ace6ed7a290f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,41,72,11,118,74,250,198,206,198,56,46,219,42,206,110,215,162,144,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
