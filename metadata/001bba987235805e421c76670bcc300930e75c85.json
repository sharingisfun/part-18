Ingrid Croce recalls how a contract Croce signed early in his career sent the majority of his earnings to his representatives, keeping him and Ingrid in relative poverty even as Croce's career soared. Killed in a plane crash just as he was gaining worldwide recognition, Croce was destined to never see the money his records eamed. Ingrid recounts picking up the pieces, includlng her successful court battle to win back the money that was rightfully Croce's. Additionally, Jim Croce: Behind The Music features a Croce recording never before made public called &quot;Im Just a Country Boy&quot; the first song Croce ever sang to wife Ingrid.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2367 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:21.452\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 815 MB\nEncoded by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:001bba987235805e421c76670bcc300930e75c85","amp;dn":"VH1.Behind.The.Music.Jim.Croce.XviD.AC3.MVGroup.Forum.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"001bba987235805e421c76670bcc300930e75c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,27,186,152,114,53,128,94,66,28,118,103,11,204,48,9,48,231,92,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
