Although a relatively young procedure, PDT has enjoyed increased popularity during the last ten years.\n\nAs research has grown, two distinct routes have appeared: the United States model and the European one, each focusing on different uses and photosensitizers. Dr. Gold has assembled the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experts on PDT to create a book that concisely covers every use and photosensitizer available around the world and includes comprehensive coverage of both of the FDA-approved photosensitizers in the United States, all the while carefully differentiating between off-label and FDA-approved uses of photodynamic therapy.\n\nPhotodynamic Therapy in Dermatology emphasizes how to integrate PDT into practice. Toward this end, it is organized by disease category, with each chapter providing a systematic discussion of indications, PDT approaches from country to country, common side effects, prognosis as well as the underlying science. The book will be of value to dermatologists seeking a state-of-the-art review of PDT around the world, the latest in its clinical uses, and guidance on how to incorporate PDT into clinical practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6006b50625f87775d6a6a32e4f968ed204479b5a","amp;dn":"Photodynamic+Therapy+In+Dermatology+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6006b50625f87775d6a6a32e4f968ed204479b5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,6,181,6,37,248,119,117,214,166,163,46,79,150,142,210,4,71,155,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
