The versions I found on youtube was beyond crappy, so this is a rip from a BluRay version of the movie, downmixed from 48khz 7.1 DTS to 2 channels and transcoded to MP3 44.1khz.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1705937340d95565f257c2a436edbac3f1fdd1b9","amp;dn":"Killers_Go_all_the_way.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1705937340d95565f257c2a436edbac3f1fdd1b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,5,147,115,64,217,85,101,242,87,194,164,54,237,186,195,241,253,209,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
