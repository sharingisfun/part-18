The New York based group went through various incarnations, eventually choosing drummer Marc Slutsky after he responded to an advertisement in the Village Voice and lead guitarist Jonathan Svec to round out the band.\n\nThe fledgling group embarked on an extensive European festival tour opening for such nu-metal titans as Korn, as well as playing various gigs around New York City. Bandleader Waymon Boone was the son of a professional R&amp;B/disco singer and often accompanied his mother on the road. While traveling with her, he witnessed first-hand the hardships that go along with being a musician.\n\nThis did not deter him or the band as they were finally rewarded with a recording contract from Columbia Records after they were awarded best band at a contest. Their years of hard work paid off when they teamed with respected musician/producer Todd Rundgren on their 1999 debut album, Halfway Down the Sky. The album spawned two crossover hits in &quot;Yeah, Whatever&quot; and &quot;I Think God Can Explain.&quot; In 2001, the band signed with legendary music mogul Clive Davis' J Records. A year later, To Whom it May Concern was released which spawned the single &quot;Save It For Later&quot;.&quot;The Loneliest Person I Know&quot;.\n\nShortly following their second release, the group disbanded to start other projects. However, the Waymon Boone recently announced on his myspace page that the band is starting to record its new album in September and is going on a tour on February 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c87ba84ef9255135e0c5919b3380fe07e144ecf3","amp;dn":"Splender--To+Whom+it+May+Concern--re-upload--vikingsfreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c87ba84ef9255135e0c5919b3380fe07e144ecf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,123,168,78,249,37,81,53,224,197,145,155,51,128,254,7,225,68,236,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
