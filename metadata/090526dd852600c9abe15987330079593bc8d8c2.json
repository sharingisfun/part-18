That's as much as Nike+ (11 million as of February) and runner favorite RunKeeper (14 million) combined.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nTECHCRUNCH: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thanks to MapMyFitness, RunKeeper, Nike and many more, apps that keep track of your exercise and push you to drop those extra pounds are by no means novel. Nonetheless, bootstrapped European startup Runtastic is still managing to carve out a name for itself by offering a simple user experience, while still offering the deeper functionality of higher-end products.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nNY TIMES: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I went ahead and downloaded it even though I was skeptical that it would go beyond the familiar territory of similar apps like Endomondo and RunKeeper. Like those two, Runtastic primarily maps and records your route. But RuntasticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interface has some qualities the others donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Runtastic.com is well designed, too.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nKeywords: Running, Runing, Jogging, Joging, Walking, Waking, Run, Jog, Walk, Biking, Fitness, Exercise, Exercize, 5k, 10k, Marathon, Training, Workout, Work-out, Cardio, Tracker, Traker, Track, Tracking, Traking, GPS, Routes, Music, Musik, Runtastik, App, Apps, My, Pal, Trainer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090526dd852600c9abe15987330079593bc8d8c2","amp;dn":"Runtastic+Pro+4.0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090526dd852600c9abe15987330079593bc8d8c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,5,38,221,133,38,0,201,171,225,89,135,51,0,121,89,59,200,216,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
