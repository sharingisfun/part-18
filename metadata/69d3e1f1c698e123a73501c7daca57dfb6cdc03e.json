The video, itself, cuts between scenes of the band playing and a demure young lady who has shown up for an audition (a handmade sign on the wall says &quot;Van Halen Casting&quot;). While waiting, she spies on the other girls through a hole in the changing room door and is fascinated by their provocative dress and behavior. When they finally notice her, one uses a power drill to create a hole in the door and harass her, ultimately scaring her off.\n\nThe video is also preceded with a young girl reciting a poem of &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;, and ends with an outtake of her, as well.\n\n\n\nFile Name:\n06 Poundcake - Van Halen\n\nFile Format:\nmp4\n\nDuration:\n00:05:23\n\nBit Rate:\n1294k\n\nFile Size:\n50.00 MB\n\nVideo Codec:\nh264\n\nVideo Bitrate:\n1165k\n\nVideo Size:\n720x528\n\nAspect Ratio:\n1.36:1\n\nFrame Rate:\n23.98fps\n\nAudio Codec:\nmp3\n\nAudio Bitrate:\n128k\n\nChannels:\n2\n\nSample Rate:\n48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69d3e1f1c698e123a73501c7daca57dfb6cdc03e","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Poundcake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69d3e1f1c698e123a73501c7daca57dfb6cdc03e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,211,225,241,198,152,225,35,167,53,1,199,218,202,87,223,182,205,192,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
