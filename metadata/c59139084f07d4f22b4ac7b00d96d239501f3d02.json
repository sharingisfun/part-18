This DVD covers more advanced fiberglass projects and is designed to take those with basic fiberglass experience to the next level of fabrication. Recommended for professional installers and those wanting professional results from their own vehicles.\nfiberglass subwoofer enclosure \tThis DVD covers three fiberglass projects in depth. The first is the creation of a vehicle molded subwoofer enclosure. These space saving and stealthy enclosures will have you installing subwoofer boxes in places you never thought possible. You'll be walked through the process of creating an enclosure with less than $50 in materials (comparable to a $300-500 retail enclosure).\nfiberglass enclosure subwoofer \tThe second project is a combination subwoofer enclosure and amplifier rack. You'll learn how to combine a triple woofer enclosure with a flush mounted amplifier rack in a single piece. You'll learn how to frame up the project, wrap it, strengthen it, prime it, paint it and get it ready for a show quality system. You'll be able to make this project with less than $100 in total material cost.\nfiberglass door panel tweeter pod \tThe final project is the creation of custom door panels and tweeter pods. You'll learn how to blend textures and colors and how to make sure the door fits properly after completion. You'll learn how to cut, bond, texture and dye match your projects so that your new door panels don't look like they were bolted on. Total cost to make these custom panels and pods, together, is less than $50 a set.\n\nAll three projects are high value, low cost pieces that are designed to take you to the next level of fiberglass fabrication. It's highly recommended that you have access to an air compressor for several of the tools used in this video (air sander, paint gun, etc.). A materials list is also included that will show you where to purchase the fiberglass and other specialty materials used (both locally and online). And all of our videos were created by an MECP certified Master Installer so you'll know you're learning to do it the right way.\n\nHere are some of the topics and techniques you'll learn that will save you time, money and aggravation.\nMaterials and Tools\n\n    Fabrication materials\n        Fiberglass cloths\n        Resins and body fillers\n        Plastic adhesives and fillers\n        Primers and paints\n        Textures and dyes\n    Tools needed\n        Hand tools\n        Power tools\n\n\tfiberglass car audio paint gun\nFiberglass Molded Enclosure\n\n    Creating the mold base\n        Protecting the vehicle\n        Laying up the fiberglass\n    Speaker mounting rings\n        Creating perfect circles\n        Flush mounting\n        Level mounting on uneven surfaces\n    Wrapping the enclosure\n        Low cost, high yield cloth\n        Strengthening the enclosure\n        Use of body filler\n    Finishing the enclosure\n        Mounting speaker terminals without screws\n        Wrapping the curved enclosure\n\n\tcar audio fiberglass subwoofer enclosure\nFiberglass Enclosure and Amp Rack\n\n    Style techniques for your enclosure\n        Making perfectly rounded corners\n        Angling the woofers\n    Framing the shape\n        Mirror imaging the woofers\n        Flush mounting the amplifier rack\n    Wrapping the frame and enclosure\n        Securing the fabric\n        Trimming the fabric flush for less finish time\n    Strengthening the enclosure\n        Stiffening without fiberglass\n        &quot;Inside out&quot; technique\n    Painting the project\n        Priming for paint\n        Painting techniques for a professional finish\n    Final finishing\n        Combining materials\n        Inverting the woofers and hiding the wires\n\n\tfiberglass subwoofer enclosure amp rack\nCustom Door Panels and Tweeter Pods\n\n    Choosing your driver mounting location\n        Flush or angle mounting\n        Utilizing stock cut outs\n    Creating a sail panel tweeter pod\n        Duplicating the stock panel\n        Forming the pods\n    Bonding MDF to plastic\n        Removing the stock panel sections\n        Special filler material needed\n    Integrating with the vehicle cosmetics\n        Creating a factory texture\n        Applying factory matched colors\n    Achieving a factory fit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59139084f07d4f22b4ac7b00d96d239501f3d02","amp;dn":"Fiberglass+Fabrication+-+Disc+2+of+2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59139084f07d4f22b4ac7b00d96d239501f3d02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,145,57,8,79,7,212,242,43,74,199,176,13,150,210,57,80,31,61,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
