It consisted primarily of the OPENSTEP operating system ported to the PowerMac along with new graphics in the GUI to make it appear more Mac-like. Several existing Mac OS technologies were also ported to Rhapsody, including QuickTime and AppleSearch. Rhapsody could also run a selection of existing Mac OS programs through the &quot;Blue Box&quot; emulation layer. Compared to the &quot;invisible&quot; blue box in OS X, Rhapsody's Blue Box was &quot;noticeable&quot; as it opened a Classic like program and there was no Carbon to help port existing Mac software to the new OS without the Blue Box.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d89886d0dcf29c5e0f7c7a789ca5973f1341e854","amp;dn":"Rhapsody+DR2+x86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d89886d0dcf29c5e0f7c7a789ca5973f1341e854","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,152,134,208,220,242,156,94,15,124,122,120,156,165,151,63,19,65,232,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
