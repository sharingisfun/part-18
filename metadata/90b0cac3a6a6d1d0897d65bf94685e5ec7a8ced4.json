It is about ulcers as well as accidents, about shouting matches as well as fistfights, about nervous breakdowns as well as kicking the dog around. It is, above all (or beneath all), about daily humiliations. To survive the day is triumph enough for the walking wounded among the great many of us.\n\nThe scars, psychic as well as physical, brought home to the supper table and the TV set, may have touched, malignantly, the soul of our society. More or less. (&quot;More or less,&quot; that most ambiguous of phrases, pervades many of the conversations that comprise this book, reflecting, per haps, an ambiguity of attitude toward The Job. Something more than Orwellian acceptance, something less than Luddite sabotage. Often the two impulses are fused in the same person.) - From the Preface\n\n\nStuds Terkel records the voices of America. Men and women from every walk of life talk to him, telling him of their likes and dislikes, fears, problems, and happinesses on the job. Once again, Terkel has created a rich and unique document that is as simple as conversation, but as subtle and heartfelt as the meaning of our lives.... In the first trade paperback edition of his national bestseller, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Studs Terkel presents &quot;the real American experience&quot; (Chicago Daily News)--&quot;a magnificent book . . .. A work of art. To read it is to hear America talking.&quot; (Boston Globe)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b0cac3a6a6d1d0897d65bf94685e5ec7a8ced4","amp;dn":"Studs+Terkel+-+1974+-+Working+-+People+Talk+About+What+They+Do+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b0cac3a6a6d1d0897d65bf94685e5ec7a8ced4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,176,202,195,166,166,209,208,137,125,101,191,148,104,94,94,199,168,206,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
