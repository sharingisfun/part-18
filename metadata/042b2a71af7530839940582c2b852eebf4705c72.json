This is essentially the Bible for those who ride freight trains in the United States. It consists of a great deal of localized information pertaining to trainyards &amp; lines in the US.  Schedules, locations, places to get in &amp; out, the local situation with police, etc.  The only problem is that it&amp;#039;s been something of an underground document &amp; consequently hard to come by.\n\nNo longer!  It&amp;#039;s been scanned &amp; now made available on The Pirate Bay.\n\nIt appears the compiler, &amp;#039;Traindoc&amp;#039;, is fairly virulent in exerting his claimed copyright privileges.  In particular, he doesn&amp;#039;t want it distributed on the Internet in any way or form.  By posting this first on The Pirate Bay, as much an anti-copyright advocacy site as an Internet torrent tracker, I hope it&amp;#039;s obvious what I think about all of that.  (Hypocritically, a fair number of the same people who break laws relating to the physical property rights of railroad companies on a regular basis have no qualms about invoking the US&amp;#039;s Digital Millenium Copyright Act--premised upon the dubious concept of intellectual property--whenever this document appears online.)\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re interested in freighthopping in the US, download this &amp; spread it far &amp; wide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:042b2a71af7530839940582c2b852eebf4705c72","amp;dn":"Crew+Change+Guide+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"042b2a71af7530839940582c2b852eebf4705c72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,43,42,113,175,117,48,131,153,64,88,44,43,133,46,235,244,112,92,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
