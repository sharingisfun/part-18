The unwed daughter of wealthy Jewish industrialists and a gifted pianist bound for Radcliffe, Bea plans to leave her shameful secret behind and make a fresh start. Ten years later, Prohibition is in full swing, post-WWI America is in the grips of rampant xenophobia, and Beaâ€™s hopes for her future remain unfulfilled. She returns to her uncleâ€™s house, seeking a refuge from her unhappiness. But she discovers far more when the rum-running manager of the local quarry inadvertently reunites her with Emma Murphy, the headstrong Irish Catholic woman who has been raising Beaâ€™s abandoned childâ€”now a bright, bold, cross-dressing girl named Lucy Pear, with secrets of her own.\r\nIn mesmerizing prose, award-winning author Anna Solomon weaves together an unforgettable group of characters as their lives collide on the New England coast. Set against one of Americaâ€™s most turbulent decades, Leaving Lucy Pear delves into questions of class, freedom, and the meaning of family, establishing Anna Solomon as one of our most captivating storytellers.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9165d8d12106a9d9c99404d96f0c8d27defbb9c9","amp;dn":"Leaving+Lucy+Pear+-+Anna+Solomon+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9165d8d12106a9d9c99404d96f0c8d27defbb9c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,101,216,209,33,6,169,217,201,148,4,217,111,12,141,39,222,251,185,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
