There have also been some guest appearances by Tracy HITCHINGS (singer of QUASAR, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN &amp; LANDMARQ) and Steve ROTHERY (MARILLION's gifted guitarist).\n\n&quot;Songs From The Lion's Cage&quot; is then a very professional Progressive rock, both close to MARILLION and hard-rock. &quot;Pride&quot;, their second opus issued in 1996 (one year after the previous one) confirmed the high musical level of this band, at a time when they added a touch IQ to their music. Curiously the band's sound gained in heaviness after their 2 first albums, and the music quality increased a lot in originality and musicianship.\n\nRecorded in 1998, &quot;The Visitor&quot; alternates passages inspired by Steve HOGARTH's group along with some dark instrumentation. &quot;Immortal&quot; shows a new heavier dimension that still remains anchored in the best neo-Progressive music. &quot;Moviedrome&quot; is an excellent twenty minute track. &quot;Contagion&quot; follows the glorious tradition of &quot;Immortal&quot;, although I found it more hard edged and multidimensional from all aspects. This powerful and evoking concept album tells about the quest for redemption, through the vision of a dark and anguishing future. No doubt about it, people won't have to think for a long time before electing the best album of winter 2002-2003! One of the best bands on the English scene nowadays... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab2c02edb0cacdc399f4016640e08244265cfb24","amp;dn":"Arena+-+2011+-+The+Seventh+Degree+Of+Separation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab2c02edb0cacdc399f4016640e08244265cfb24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,44,2,237,176,202,205,195,153,244,1,102,64,224,130,68,38,92,251,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
