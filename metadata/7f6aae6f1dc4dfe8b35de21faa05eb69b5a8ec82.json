Law of Attraction in Action - Episode Ten\n\nEPISODE TEN CONTAINS:\n\nFate, predestiny, and fortune-telling:  &quot;Abraham, how would you explain someone being able to tell my future in advance, before things ever happen?&quot;\n\nHitting a &quot;belief wall&quot;: Why can't he just let go, believe, and enjoy it all?\n\n\nSwirling energy, soaring joy, and blissing-out: He's like a meditation junkie-it feels so good. Abraham talks about feeling that same energy while being fully engaged in life.\n\n\nCan a gentle teacher teach tough kids?  Kicked out of every other school-are they unteachable? Are they even reachable? Abraham has a talk with the teacher.\n    \n\nLooking for a breakthrough:   Abraham suggests softer, less-challenging, what-you-can-already-believe steps.\n   \nLawsuits:  What they represent and why they are always upstream. Abraham states their case.\n\nWhy should the Hickses get paid for working? &quot;I have difficulty with the amount of money you're charging for the workshops and tapes. Why doesn't the copyright just say Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcopy this freely and give to a friend in need'?&quot;\n\nWill he ever see his four-legged friend again? Feeling guilty about the preventable death of his dog. Abraham unleashes his worry.\n\nDo we choose our life situation before we arrive? &quot;Yes!&quot; says Abraham. &quot;It's all part of the expansion process.&quot;\n\nWorkplace freedom and control: A business owner seeks advice on employee rule-setting.\n\nShould she toss out pre-Abraham marketing expertise? How do &quot;attraction&quot; and &quot;allowing&quot; fit with traditional marketing techniques?\n\nIs &quot;giving up&quot; downstream or upstream? &quot;You're not giving up on your desires; you're just giving up the struggle.&quot;\n\n&quot;If you're beating the drum of hopefulness, you're nearly there.&quot;\n\nAnswers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham - whom Esther calls &quot;infinite intelligence&quot; and Jerry refers to as &quot;the purest form of love I've ever encountered.&quot;\n\n\nAbraham, Jerry &amp; Esther Hicks &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/about_abraham.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/about_abraham.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f6aae6f1dc4dfe8b35de21faa05eb69b5a8ec82","amp;dn":"Abraham-Hicks+Law+Of+Attraction+In+Action+EP10+VOB+2DVDs+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f6aae6f1dc4dfe8b35de21faa05eb69b5a8ec82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,106,174,111,29,196,223,232,179,93,226,31,170,5,235,105,181,168,236,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
