Although \ngorillas have been much-maligned in our popular culture, viewers will finally &quot;meet the legend&quot; \nface to face, and learn about their uncertain future.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe Mountain Gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is one of two subspecies of Eastern Gorillas. There are two populations. One is only found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa, within three national parks: Mgahinga, in south-west Uganda; Volcanoes, in north-west Rwanda; and Virunga, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The other is found in Uganda&amp;#039;s Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Some claim that the Bwindi population in Uganda is a third subspecies, although no formal taxonomic description has been published.\n\nA census taken in 2003 has shown a 17% increase in population size since 1989. There are now a total of 380 gorillas in 30 social groups in the Virungas and a total of about 320 in Bwindi. However, the Mountain Gorilla continues to be considered critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. It faces an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild due to habitat loss, poaching, human disease, and war. All in all there are only around 700 Mountain Gorillas left.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nGeneral #0\nSource : Mountain Gorilla.1080p.DD5.1.h264.ts (thanks HDbits)\nComplete name :\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 1.07 GiB\nPlayTime : 37mn 39s\nBit rate : 4083 Kbps\nSubtitles : Chinese (sorry no other available)\n\nVideo #0\nCodec : MPEG-4 AVC/X264\nCodec/Info : Prestige Matrix\nPlayTime : 37mn 39s\nWidth : 1280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nAspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0\nCodec : AC3\nCodec/Info : Dolby AC3 384kb/s\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nSampling rate : 48 KHz\n\nEncoded by : jvt40 for MVGroup\n\nRelease Notes\n\nThis DOESNÃ‚Â´t play on standalone DVD players , easiest is to use VLC , PLAYBACK GUIDE HERE\n\nThanks to Ashinc for all your help.\n\nRelated Documentaries\nGorilla \nCousins\nKoko a Talking Gorilla \nConversation with Koko\n\nwww mvgroup org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2f668940c5db9718919dcf0333cef41f30d9072","amp;dn":"IMAX+Mountain+Gorilla+x264+720p+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2f668940c5db9718919dcf0333cef41f30d9072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,246,104,148,12,93,185,113,137,25,220,240,51,60,239,65,243,13,144,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
