Hartley (Beaufort Books, 1973). Introduction by Lord David Cecil. 760 pp. \n\nNew scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate metadata and pagination, etc.\n\n\nL.P. Hartley (1895 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1972) was a British novelist and short story writer. His best-known novels are the Eustace and Hilda trilogy (1947) and The Go-Between (1953). The latter was made into a 1970 film, directed by Joseph Losey with a star cast, in an adaptation by Harold Pinter. Its opening sentence, &quot;The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there,&quot; has become almost proverbial.\n\nHartley was also a short story writer, and his ghost stories are some of the finest of the twentieth century.\n\nDespite its title, this book does not contain all his short stories, but there are quite a few here, plus a novella, Simonetta Perkins.\n\nIf you haven't read Hartley, try the story &quot;W.S.&quot; You won't regret it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f87077abe02dbbbb3cdde53128e3c3def0339af","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Short+Stories+of+L.P.+Hartley+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f87077abe02dbbbb3cdde53128e3c3def0339af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,135,7,122,190,2,219,187,179,205,222,83,18,142,60,61,239,3,57,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
