Each episode, approximately 25 minutes long, looks back at the news and events of a particular year, from 1962 to 1999. The programme uses news archive footage, along with subtitles as the means of narration, to recount notable Irish and international events of the time. Music from the particular year is also played over the footage, with occasional scenes of live performances or music videos, generally (but not exclusively) by an Irish artist. The theme tune for the series comes from Steely Dan&amp;#039;s 1972 hit &quot;Reelin&amp;#039; in the Years&quot;. In 2008, a DVD entitled Reeling in the 80s was released for the Irish market.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeling_in_the_Years&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeling_in_the_Years&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93cb9623d333d8e220ce341355ba47d7cfd7d65e","amp;dn":"Reeling+in+the+Years","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93cb9623d333d8e220ce341355ba47d7cfd7d65e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,203,150,35,211,51,216,226,32,206,52,19,85,186,71,215,207,215,214,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
