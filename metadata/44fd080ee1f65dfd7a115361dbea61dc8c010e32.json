Formed in 1966, El Rego and his Commandos created the template others would exploit more successfully: a wildly inspired blend of tribal rhythms, wah-wah guitar, fatback bass lines, and the heated unnnhs and yeeowws that typify James Brown funk. So &quot;Feeling You Got&quot; sounds like a rougher, rawer version of Archie Bell on this collection of 45s (but dig that crazy accordion!). &quot;Vive Le Renouveau&quot; advocates revolution (ironically) via funereal desert blues. And &quot;Cholera&quot; treats a deadly disease with funky cold sweat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44fd080ee1f65dfd7a115361dbea61dc8c010e32","amp;dn":"El+Rego+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44fd080ee1f65dfd7a115361dbea61dc8c010e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,253,8,14,225,246,93,253,122,17,83,97,219,234,97,220,140,1,14,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
