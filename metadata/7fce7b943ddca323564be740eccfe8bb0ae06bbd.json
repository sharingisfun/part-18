Musa (CRC, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nThis reference offers tools for engineers, scientists, biologists, and others working with the computational techniques of nanophotonics. It introduces the key concepts of computational methods in a manner that is easily digestible for newcomers to the field. The book also examines future applications of nanophotonics in the technical industry and covers new developments and interdisciplinary research in engineering, science, and medicine. It provides an overview of the key computational nanophotonics and describes the technologies with an emphasis on how they work and their key benefits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fce7b943ddca323564be740eccfe8bb0ae06bbd","amp;dn":"Computational+Nanophotonics+-+Modeling+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fce7b943ddca323564be740eccfe8bb0ae06bbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,206,123,148,61,220,163,35,86,75,231,64,236,207,232,187,10,224,107,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
