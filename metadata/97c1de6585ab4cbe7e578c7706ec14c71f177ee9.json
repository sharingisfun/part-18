Iron Man reveals the man behind the icon yet still captures IommiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humor, intelligence, and warmth. He speaks honestly and unflinchingly about his rough-and-tumble childhood, the accident that almost ended his career, his failed marriages, personal tragedies, battles with addiction, band mates, famous friends, newfound daughter, and the ups and downs of his life as an artist.\n\nEverything associated with hard rock happened to Black Sabbath first: the drugs, the debauchery, the drinking, the dungeons, the pressure, the pain, the conquests, the company men, the contracts, the combustible drummer, the critics, the comebacks, the singers, the Stonehenge set, the music, the money, the madness, the metal.\n\nPublisher: Da Capo Press; First Trade Paper Edition edition (December 11, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0306821451\nISBN-13: 978-0306821455\n\nReview\n\nPublishers Weekly, 6/27\n[Tony Iommi is] Ã¢â‚¬Å“the undisputed originator of heavy metal.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nKirkus Reviews, 10/1/11\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[Iommi is] most entertaining when describing the SabbathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incessant, hazardous prank-playingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The guitarist is not wholly unaware of the oft-ludicrous nature of his enterprise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPublishers Weekly, 10/3/11\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An important addition to the Black Sabbath storyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦IommiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s autobiography is as direct as his music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBooklist, 11/1/11\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This memoir [is] dead certain to appeal to heavy-metal fans of all agesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦With plenty of behind-the-scenes stories and fresh perspectives on some of musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most notorious charactersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦this is a frank and honest look at a special part of rock history.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRollingStone.com, 10/24/11\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The book recounts all the ups and downs the guitarist experienced with Ozzy Osbourne and company.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHouston Press, 10/20/11\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Written in short, easily digestible chapters, Iommi's autobiography is full of revelations and observations of his careerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦A good read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nUSA Today, 10/31/11\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Iommi has a story that needs to be toldÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Iommi tells his story simply and chronologically, making it easy for anyone to slip into the fast-paced tale.

A pleasure to read even without knowing who Iommi is (difficult to believe, but I am meeting more and more young morons who never heard Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple). We knew before Ozzy's view of the story (I Am Ozzy), and finally we've got to hear the Iron Man. A bit reserved maybe, but written with a lot of decency and respect towards fellow musicians (not only Sabbath, but other acts too).I might disagree with the place of Ronnie James Dio in the history of Black Sabbath, or how the later albums (post-Ozzy) were rated, but - that's the book by Tony Iommi, and that's his story. No need to talk too much about it - must read\n\n\nA fresh take on a well worn story\nBy Christopher on November 6, 2011\nBlack Sabbath from a non Ozzy-centric point of view. Finally, we hear from another voice, learn of different characters, and, best of all, are treated to some new stories. I like Ozzy as much as the next guy, but there are only so many times you want to hear the same stories, about the same person, told from the same point of view. With &quot;Iron Man&quot;, Mr. Iommi manages to bring a breath of fresh air in to a well worn story; we see that there was far more to Black Sabbath than just Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nHaving said that, I must point out one glaring flaw in this work; while there was a professional writer involved in creating the book, TJ Lammers, there remains the need for a better novelization of Iommi's reflections. The book ultimately read much more like a compilation of journal entries, than a fluid biography. The chapters are extremely short and fail to feed in to one another, creating a choppy feel to the story telling. One is left with the impression that Mr. Lammers compiled a series of interview highlights to tell the story, rather than used the interviews as research for the story.\n\nShortcomings aside, &quot;Iron Man&quot; provides a much needed alternative take on the subject matter; a better understanding of both Black Sabbath and Tony Iommi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c1de6585ab4cbe7e578c7706ec14c71f177ee9","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+My+Journey+through+Heaven+and+Hell+with+Black+Sabbath%28e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c1de6585ab4cbe7e578c7706ec14c71f177ee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,193,222,101,133,171,76,190,126,87,140,119,6,236,20,199,31,23,126,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
