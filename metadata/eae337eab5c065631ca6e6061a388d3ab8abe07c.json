Also included is twenty of the very best unofficial flash games having The Matrix theme as well as a real cool handful of The Matrix related flash animated short films.\n\nThese games are played within your favorite web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox without having to install any additional software and also without having to be online or connected to the internet. This is accomplished by associating your browser with the games.\nTo do this read below...\n\nInstructions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In Windows right click on a game to make the context menu appear then scroll to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Open withÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ option and click on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Choose default program...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the sub menu and a dialog box will appear. Double-click on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Other programsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bar to reveal more programs then find your browser and click it once to highlight it and make sure the box is check-marked which says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Always use the selected program to open this kind of fileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and click OK. That's it! You have now associated flash with your browser and you will never have to repeat these steps again since the games will now open up automatic when you double-click on them. I have included 2 screen-shots named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Step 1Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Step 2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to show how to do it. A couple of these games require you to temporarily enable or allow ActiveX content in order to work right. To do this in Internet Explorer just click the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Allow Blocked ContentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ button on the yellow bar.\n\nAnother Matrix game of interest worth mentioning is The Matrix Online MMORPG AKA MxO.\nThe game continued The Matrix storyline picking up where the last movie left off. A storyline memory-book was posted online for fans when the game was finally (discontinued). A working server emulator has been developed to allow fans to continue game play.
