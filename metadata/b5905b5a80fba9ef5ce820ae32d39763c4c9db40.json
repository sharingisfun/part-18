Taking the role of His own devotee, Lord Sri Krsna appeared as Sri Krsna Chaitanya about five centuries ago in Bengal, India, and began a great social and spiritual revolution that has profoundly affected the lives of millions worldwide. His conversations with the great scholars, kings, and mystics of the day form the basis of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teachings of Lord Chaitanya,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is is an easy-to-read single-volume summary of Lord CaitanyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teachings in the beautiful and poetic 9-volume Sri Caitanya-caritamrta.\n\nThe teachings of Lord Caitanya can elevate human society to the topmost platform of spiritual activity. Such activities constitute the goal of human perfection. Illuminating knowledge can be acquired from the teachings of Lord Caitanya, and by such knowledge one can advance in spiritual existence.\n\nLord Caitanya instructed the mass of people in the sÃ„ï¿½Ã¡Â¹â€¦khya philosophy of acintya-bhedÃ„ï¿½bheda-tattva, which maintains that the Supreme Lord is simultaneously one with and different from His creation. Lord Caitanya taught this philosophy through the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. He taught that the holy name of the Lord is the sound incarnation of the Lord and that since the Lord is the absolute whole, there is no difference between His holy name and His transcendental form. Thus by chanting the holy name of the Lord one can directly associate with the Supreme Lord by sound vibration.\n\nThere is no difference between the teachings of Lord Caitanya presented here and the teachings of Lord KÃ¡Â¹â€ºÃ¡Â¹Â£Ã¡Â¹â€¡a in the Bhagavad-gÃ„Â«tÃ„ï¿½. The teachings of Lord Caitanya are practical demonstrations of Lord KÃ¡Â¹â€ºÃ¡Â¹Â£Ã¡Â¹â€¡a's teachings. \n\nLord Caitanya's teachings are identical to those given by Lord Kapila, the original propounder of sÃ„ï¿½Ã¡Â¹â€¦khya-yoga, the sÃ„ï¿½Ã¡Â¹â€¦khya system of philosophy. This authorized system of yoga recommends meditation on the transcendental form of the Lord.\n\nFor more information please visit &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://prabhupadabooks.com/tlc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://prabhupadabooks.com/tlc&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKeep Seeding After Downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5905b5a80fba9ef5ce820ae32d39763c4c9db40","amp;dn":"Teachings+of+Lord+Caitanya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5905b5a80fba9ef5ce820ae32d39763c4c9db40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,144,91,90,128,251,169,239,92,232,32,174,50,211,151,99,196,201,219,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
