While their songs expectedly contain the   \n           rage of such contemporaries as Korn and Rage Against the Machine, Scantlin's voice  \n           at times is eerily similar to Nirvana's late great frontman Kurt Cobain, containing \n           unmistakable elements of traditional hard rock (unlike the other aforementioned     \n           band's penchant for rap). August 2001 saw the release of their major label debut,   \n           Come Clean (which was preceded by the independent release Abrasive), as they        \n           embarked on a European tour with Godsmack a month later, before touring the U.S. as \n           part of the Family Values 2001 tour, alongside Stone Temple Pilots, Linkin Park,    \n           and Staind.                                                                         \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Control                     [03:50]                                        \n                 02.Drift &amp; die                 [04:25]                                        \n                 03.Out of my head              [03:43]                                        \n                 04.Nobody told me              [05:22]                                        \n                 05.Blurry                      [05:04]                                        \n                 06.She hates me                [03:37]                                        \n                 07.Bring me down               [04:03]                                        \n                 08.Never change                [03:59]                                        \n                 09.Basement                    [04:22]                                        \n                 10.Said                        [04:08]                                        \n                 11.Piss it all away            [05:39]                                        \n                                                       ____                         /\n                                                                                     \n                             \t\t\t\t48:12 min\t\t    \n                         \t\t\t\t 80,2 MB\t\t   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4b34949b9827c1c4fa16a75048223d643ecf04e","amp;dn":"Puddle_Of_Mudd-Come_Clean-%28Retail%29-2001-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4b34949b9827c1c4fa16a75048223d643ecf04e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,179,73,73,185,130,124,28,79,161,106,117,4,130,35,214,67,236,240,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
