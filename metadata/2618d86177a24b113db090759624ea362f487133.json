Looking like an animated blob of mustard in his bright yellow raincoat, he invests time, passion and energy (but seldom actual cash) in a series of increasingly bizarre money-making schemes. Finance for a dog college? It's yours. Shares in an accident syndicate? Easily arranged. Promoting a kind-hearted heavyweight boxer? A snip. \n\nPoor Corky Corcoran, Ukridge's old school chum and confidant, trails through these pages in the ebullient wake of Wodehouse's most disreputable but endearing hero and hopes to escape with his shirt at least.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Ukridge-Sir-P-G-Wodehouse/dp/0099513897&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Ukridge-Sir-P-G-Wodehouse/dp/0099513897&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2618d86177a24b113db090759624ea362f487133","amp;dn":"P.+G.+Wodehouse+-+Ukridge.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2618d86177a24b113db090759624ea362f487133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,24,216,97,119,162,75,17,61,176,144,117,150,36,234,54,47,72,113,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
