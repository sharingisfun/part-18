Re-live Stan and Jack's stories of the Norse Gods and Thor before he came to Earth as Don Blake. Witness as these masters breathe life into the thunder god. Read these stories as never before with all-new, modern coloring and six interlocking covers by Olivier Coipel.&quot;\n\nJust to clarify that description, this series reprints several short 4-8 page backup stories that were originally printed in Journey Into Mystery and The Mighty Thor during Lee &amp; Kirby's time; although I have posted those already, this is nice little series because it takes all those &quot;tales&quot; and puts them in some sort of logical reading sequence, and you don't have to dig through whole issues to find them. These scans are courtesy of various Minutemen groups (TheMother and DTs, specifically) and I have added the 1968 Tales of Asgard one-shot, also by Lee &amp; Kirby - that is by BWT-DCP. All issuers are cover-to-cover. Thanks to all the great scanners for their efforts, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2213ffa17889298e57425a8756937cc326e8e168","amp;dn":"Thor+-+Tales+Of+Asgard+01-06+%2B+Ex+%282009%7CC2C%7CMinutemen%2BDCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2213ffa17889298e57425a8756937cc326e8e168","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,19,255,161,120,137,41,142,87,66,90,135,86,147,124,195,38,232,225,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
