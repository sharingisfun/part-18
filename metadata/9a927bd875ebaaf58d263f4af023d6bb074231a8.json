These designs are all about fun-filled styling, although the palette is soft and subdued: dove grays, mouse browns, dusky pinks, duck-egg blues. Lucinda also turns her eye toward texture, with some great stitch patterns, including a Man in the Moon blanket and a lovely cabled cardigan. Abounding with items that will make bedtime fun, And So to Bed is a sweet dream of a book.
