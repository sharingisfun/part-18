USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!\n\nI use legit Norton and it didn't detect any threat but this is not my patch so I don't guarantee it. \n\nHere is the Virus total report which TO ME it seems like false positive: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/file/3b1c0924916f936198f15303cca3596ac02c4367cc2759fe7b78d1cc79d44303/analysis/1358314019/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/file/3b1c0924916f936198f15303cca3596ac02c4367cc2759fe7b78d1cc79d44303/analysis/1358314019/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI strongly recommend to use sandboxie to apply the patch and then just recover the patched files.
