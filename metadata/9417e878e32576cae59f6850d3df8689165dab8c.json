He should have known it couldn't stay that good for that long. The first sign of trouble appears when Oz finds his ex-wife Primavera Phillips drenched in her own tearsÃ¢â‚¬â€her life in ruins, cheated out of her fortune, and robbed of her baby boy by his lying con-man father. What could Oz do but help? Maybe he should have called for help himself, or stuck to the game plan of looking after number one. Instead he set out on a voyage of dark intrigue and wild discovery that would turn his life upside downÃ¢â‚¬â€again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9417e878e32576cae59f6850d3df8689165dab8c","amp;dn":"Alarm+Call+-+%5BOz+Blackstone%2C+%238%5D+-+Quintin+Jardine.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9417e878e32576cae59f6850d3df8689165dab8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,23,232,120,227,37,118,202,229,159,104,80,211,223,134,137,22,93,171,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
