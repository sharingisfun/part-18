The text provides a gradual development of control theory, shows how to solve all computational problems with MATLAB, and avoids highly mathematical arguments. A wealth of examples and worked problems are featured throughout the text.\n\n \n\nThe new edition includes improved coverage of Root-Locus Analysis (Chapter 6) and Frequency-Response Analysis (Chapter 8). The author has also updated and revised many of the worked examples and end-of-chapter problems. This text is ideal for control systems engineers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3335f169452507c425590fa7745c46ae328e69","amp;dn":"Modern+Control+Engineering+%285th+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3335f169452507c425590fa7745c46ae328e69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,51,53,241,105,69,37,7,196,37,89,15,167,116,92,70,174,50,142,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
