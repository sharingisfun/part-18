Unfortunately, they're\nusually charging in the wrong direction. When Candy, a bungling cop, and\nLevy, an inept lawyer, lose their jobs, they wind up together at the Guard\nDog Security Company. After thorough training in the use of firearms (for\ntwo hours), they're raring to go. But even as security guards they can't\ncut it, and rip offs take place right under their noses. Eventually they\nfigure out that the robberies aren't coincidental, and that their company\nis in cahoots with the security union's mobster president (Robert Loggia,\nThe Jagged Edge). Eager to snag the crooks, Candy and Levy set out as\nspies, and in a wild car chase turn a million dollar heist into an armed\ncarnival! When the dust finally settles, Candy and Levy save the day as\nthe hilarious rent-a-cop duo who are never more funny than when they're\nArmed and Dangerous.\n\n\n[-] F I L E - I N F O [-]\n\nGENERAL: Armed.And.Dangerous.1986.DVDRip.XviD.avi\nFORMAT : AVI(.AVI) at 940 Kbps (XviD 1.2 SMP)\nLENGHT : 717,490,176 bytes for 1:23:58\nASPECT : 608 x 336 at 25.000 fps\nAUDIO : 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 at 192 Kbps (CBR)\nINFOS : 2 channels, 48000 Hz\nIMDB : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090660/\nRATING : 5.0/10 (3,857 votes)\n\n\n[-] C A S T [-]\n\nJohn Candy ...
