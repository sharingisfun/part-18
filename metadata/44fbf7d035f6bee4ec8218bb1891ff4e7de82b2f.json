In this new special,\r\nthe political comedian brings his signature frustrated screaming\r\nto Ben Carson, the NRA and the borderline apocalyptic disaster that\r\nis the 2016 presidential election. If a politician said something\r\nstupid (and surely they did), Black is not going to let it slide.\r\n\r\nProduced by Stark Raving Black Productions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Black won't let political stupidity slide, no matter\r\nhow loudly he has to shout. Between the NRA, the media and\r\nthe election, he has plenty of idiocy to wade through.\r\n\r\nLewis.Black.Black.to.the.Future.2016.1080p.WEBRip.AAC2.0.H.264\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska Video File (MKV)\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1920x1080 23.976fps\r\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo\r\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\r\nDuration: 00:50:00\r\nFile size: 1.42 GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44fbf7d035f6bee4ec8218bb1891ff4e7de82b2f","amp;dn":"Lewis.Black.Black.to.the.Future.2016.1080p.WEBRip.AAC2.0.H.264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44fbf7d035f6bee4ec8218bb1891ff4e7de82b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,251,247,208,53,246,190,228,236,130,24,187,24,145,255,78,125,232,43,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
