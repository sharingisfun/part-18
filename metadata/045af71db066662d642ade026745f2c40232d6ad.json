In this penetrating book, Sean McMeekin draws on previously undiscovered materials from the Soviet Ministry of Finance and other European and American archives to expose some of the darkest secrets of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early days of communism. Building on one archival revelation after another, the author reveals how the Bolsheviks financed their aggression through astonishingly extensive thievery. Their looting included everything from the cash savings of private citizens to gold, silver, diamonds, jewelry, icons, antiques, and artwork.\nBy tracking illicit Soviet financial transactions across Europe, McMeekin shows how LeninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regime accomplished historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest heist between 1917 and 1922 and turned centuries of accumulated wealth into the sinews of class war. McMeekin also names names, introducing for the first time the compliant bankers, lawyers, and middlemen who, for a price, helped the Bolsheviks launder their loot, impoverish Russia, and impose their brutal will on millions.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom The New Yorker\nAfter the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks were enmeshed in a civil war and desperate for funds for everything from guns and boots for soldiers to a luxury car for Lenin. In theory, they had at their disposal the riches of the deposed Tsar, including one of the world's great reserves of gold. But the gold was the security for Russia's national debt, and most of Europe didn't recognize the new regime or its right to the treasury anyway; in today's terms, it was a rogue state under heavy sanctions whose assets were effectively frozen. What followed, McMeekin writes, was a gold-laundering boom, involving art-thieving commissars, double-dealing smugglers, and a surprisingly nefarious cast of Swedes. The Bolsheviks put teams to work prying pearls from centuries-old icons, cracked open private safe-deposit boxes, and even stripped a necklace from Catherine the Great's tomb. McMeekin's outrage about the crimes occasionally overgilds a good and relevant story, but, given the economic and cultural cost to the Russian people, it is understandable.\nCopyright Ã‚Â©2008 Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker\n\nReview\nReceived Honorable Mention for the 2010 Ed A.
