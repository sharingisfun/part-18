Her Granny Jean is spy and will have you laughing out loud. \n\nIn comes Jake Parker, the twenty-five year old lead singer of Battlescars. His reputation is the untamable bad-boy. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s completely Ã¢â‚¬Å“balls to the wallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in everything that he does. Two days after returning home from a month long tour across Europe he gets a visit from Bruce, an executive from the record label. He informs Jake that Battlescars is going back on tour for three months. What everyone doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know is that Jake is worn down and sick of the same old shit. \n\nHis record label hires AubreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dads company to fly him around for the last minute tour. In order to keep her dad's company afloat they will have to learn to play nice. When Jake first meets Aubrey she refuses to even acknowledge his existence. He sees her as refreshing and a challenge. \n\nBoth of them have some pretty heavy scars from their pasts holding them back. Can Jake get Aubrey to let him in? Or will she shoot him down based on his outlandish reputation? Will her fear of getting hurt again keep him out for good? \n\nAre the two of them a match in heaven or hell? \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0850ed5499073e98a7239f71aa835ef8e210fca5","amp;dn":"Battlescars%3A+A+Rock+%26amp%3B+Roll+Romance+by+Sophie+Monroe+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0850ed5499073e98a7239f71aa835ef8e210fca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,80,237,84,153,7,62,152,167,35,159,113,170,131,94,248,226,16,252,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
