This documentary, produced and directed by his widow and photographer Ana Jobim, brings never before released images and interviews spanning 15 years of his day-to-day life in his three favorite places in the world: New York, Rio de Janeiro and his house in the countryside. Even the most loyal fan of this musical and poetic maestro may be surprised with these scenes, which include the birth of a couple of important compositions. Aside from beautiful images of the Atlantic Forest, which Jobim loved so much, this work provides an intimate view of his family and lovely encounters with friends.\n\nExtras (English Subtitles too)\n\nTom &amp; Caymmi\nPoema ChapadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o\nTom reads Neruda\nTom's speaks\n\nFile Name .........................................: A_CASA_DO_TOM.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 751,179,776 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 57:51.536\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 608x352 (AR: 1.727)\nFPS .................................................: 29.970\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1539 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.240 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 179 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nSome screenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i718.photobucket.com/albums/ww188/just_nobody_mko/1-1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i718.photobucket.com/albums/ww188/just_nobody_mko/1-1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://i718.photobucket.com/albums/ww188/just_nobody_mko/2-1.jpg\nhttp://i718.photobucket.com/albums/ww188/just_nobody_mko/3-1.jpg\nhttp://i718.photobucket.com/albums/ww188/just_nobody_mko/4-1.jpg\nhttp://i718.photobucket.com/albums/ww188/just_nobody_mko/5.jpg\nhttp://i718.photobucket.com/albums/ww188/just_nobody_mko/6.jpg\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
