Magazine. \n\nI Hope That I Don&amp;#039;t Fall In Love With You as recorded by 10,000 Maniacs, is not available on any \n\nother CD. It was originally released as a cassette-only b-side to &quot;Candy Everybody Wants&quot; in \n\n1992. \n\nPasties and a G-String was Jeffrey Lee Pierce&amp;#039;s final recording ever before his tragic and \n\nuntimely death in April, 1996. \n\nTim Buckley recorded Martha in mid-1973, just as Waits&amp;#039; first album was being released on Asylum \n\nRecords. This is the first cover of a Waits song ever, to our knowledge. In those days, Tim and \n\nTom played on the same record company softball team! \n\nThe front cover of Step Right Up features a rare photo of the Tropicana Motel, where Waits lived \n\nin the early 1970s. The photo is courtesy of Art Fein. \n\nThe original recording of Mockin&amp;#039; Bird by Waits only appears on &quot;The Early Years Vol. 2.&quot; It is \n\nrecorded here by Tindersticks. \n\nFLAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8301b0a5787ba0431435e2ea895e5f220f5b337","amp;dn":"Step+Right+Up+-+The+Songs+of+Tom+Waits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8301b0a5787ba0431435e2ea895e5f220f5b337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,48,27,10,87,135,186,4,49,67,94,46,168,149,229,242,32,245,179,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
