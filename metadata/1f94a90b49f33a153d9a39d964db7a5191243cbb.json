While the writing is somewhat stable on Notorious, Duran Duran's efforts at sounding enigmatic and covert end up being hot and cold. Tracks like &quot;American Science&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot; try too hard, while only &quot;Meet el Presidente,&quot; a number 24 hit in Britain, sports a rather appealing flow. Beneath Duran Duran's attempts at trying to sound musically devious, mysterious, and slightly seductive, the tracks fail to bear enough weight in order to be effective all the way through. It's easy to see why the band would choose such a route at this point in their career, but moderate doses of pop enthusiasm would have made Notorious a fuller and more enjoyable package. The provocative, nightclub brand of martini-sipping pop that does surface is meritorious to a certain extent, felt mostly in the album's two biggest tracks.\nReview by Mike DeGagne\nRate 3 of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\nA1 Notorious\nA2 American Science\nA3 Skin Trade\nA4 A Matter Of Feeling\nA5 Hold Me\nB1 Vertigo (Do The Demolition)\nB2 So Misled\nB3 &quot;Meet El Presidente&quot;\nB4 Winter Marches On\nB5 Proposition\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: New Wave\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : Vinyl\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 24-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 2.9 Mbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 96 KHz\nBit depth : 32 bits (float)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f94a90b49f33a153d9a39d964db7a5191243cbb","amp;dn":"%281986%29+Duran+Duran+%26ndash%3B+Notorious+%5BVinylRip+24-96%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f94a90b49f33a153d9a39d964db7a5191243cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,148,169,11,73,243,58,21,61,154,57,217,100,219,122,81,145,36,60,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
