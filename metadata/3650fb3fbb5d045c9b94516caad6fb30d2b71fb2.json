Humanity's continued survival depends on an anti-radiation drug only available on planet Delta Three, which has been taken over by Omus, a brilliant but mad mechanic who places no value on human life. Omus wants to come to the Moon to rule and intends to attack it by ramming robot-controlled spaceships into the domes. Dr. John Caball, his son Jason, Jason's friend, Kim, and a robot named Sparks embark on Caball's space battlecruiser on an unauthorized mission to Delta Three to stop Omus\n\nAVI Information\nFilename: The Shape of Things to Come (1979) DVDRip-SER.avi\nFilesize: 731789312 Bytes (697.89 MB)\nStreams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\nVideo Stream\nCompression: xvid - XVID MPEG-4\nAvg.
