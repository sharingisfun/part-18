Lopez also sticks close to his own roots here, never allowing the live audience he's playing to or us to forget his heritage. Admittedly, there was a portion of things he says in this special in Spanish that I didn't understand, but when he's speaking English, Lopez is hysterically funny. I loved his piece about how kids today couldn't have survived the way he grew up. It's so easy to forget how spoiled kids today are but Lopez reminds us in a most hysterical way. Lopez also offers on target jabs at Arnold Schwarzenegger, elder care,and of course President Bush. I love when he talks about post Katrina clean up in New Orleans and says that it was handled by FEMA, which means &quot;Find Every Mexican Available&quot;. A laugh-out loud comedy special guaranteed to tickle the funny bone. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db2b5975711912f74d4347b85e58417b68a1137","amp;dn":"George+Lopez+-+Americas+Mexican+2007+%28DVDRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db2b5975711912f74d4347b85e58417b68a1137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,178,181,151,87,17,145,47,116,212,52,123,133,229,132,23,182,138,17,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
