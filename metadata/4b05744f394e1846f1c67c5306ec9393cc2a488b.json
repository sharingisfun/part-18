The band certainly doesn't play coy with its ...    Full Descriptionsound, as evidenced by the opening song &quot;Shakin' the Blues.&quot; Each member of the band gets a mini solo sandwiched between testosterone-induced power chords. Mike Farris' throaty vocals, reminiscent of Widespread Panic's John Bell, provide a constant source of emotion that complements Rick White and Bob Watkins' stellar guitar-driven riffs. The second track, &quot;Ride the Tide,&quot; epitomizes the band's sound as an acoustic opening gives way to a full-blown assault of feverish guitar licks and catchy hooks. This pattern is repeated on &quot;Moses Brown,&quot; a soulful song about a spiritual man spreading a message to misguided children that they need to rediscover love in the world.\n\n01\tShakin' The Blues 3:01\n02\tRide the Tide\t4:33\n03\tSomething Else 7:28\n04\tThis Is the Time\t4:35\n05\tSlow Burn 5:10\n06\tLeave Your Pride (At the Front Door) 4:46\n07\tJami\t1:35\n08\tSister Mercy\t6:03\n09\tMajestic\t7:33\n10\tMoses Brown\t5:56\n11\tLet It Flow\t5:30\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies: Mike Farris (vocals); Rick White (guitar); Bob Watkins (guitar, background vocals); Steve Burgess (bass, background vocals); Terry Thomas (drums, percussion).\n\nAdditional personnel: Paul Ebersold (Hammond B-3, piano, percussion); Rick Steff (Hammond B-3, piano); Jackie Johnson, Susan Marshall Powell (background vocals).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b05744f394e1846f1c67c5306ec9393cc2a488b","amp;dn":"The+Screamin+Cheetah+Wheelies+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b05744f394e1846f1c67c5306ec9393cc2a488b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,5,116,79,57,78,24,70,241,198,124,83,6,236,147,147,204,42,72,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
