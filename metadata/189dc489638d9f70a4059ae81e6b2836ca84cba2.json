FarmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ markets are merely a lifestyle choice. And Ã¢â‚¬ËœorganicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is little more than a marketing label, way past its sell by date. This may be a little hard to swallow for the ethically-aware food shopper but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it any less true. And now the UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most outspoken and entertaining food writer is ready to explain why.\n\nJay Rayner combines personal experience and hard-nosed reportage to explain why the doctrine of organic has been eclipsed by the need for sustainable intensification; and why the future lies in large-scale food production rather than the cottage industries that foodies often cheer for. From the cornfields of Illinois to the killing lines of Yorkshire abattoirs, Rayner takes us on a journey that will change the way we shop, cook and eat forever. And give us a few belly laughs along the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:189dc489638d9f70a4059ae81e6b2836ca84cba2","amp;dn":"A+Greedy+Man+in+a+Hungry+World+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"189dc489638d9f70a4059ae81e6b2836ca84cba2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,157,196,137,99,141,159,112,164,5,154,232,30,107,40,54,202,132,203,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
