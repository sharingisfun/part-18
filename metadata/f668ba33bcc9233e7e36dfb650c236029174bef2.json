In the countryside virtually every household has a cowshed. Martin meets Shubaka Chowlagi, a farmer who supports his entire family with just eight cows. As cows are sacred in Nepal, it is illegal to kill them and it is taboo to eat them which means most live long lives. Martin visits a shelter for elderly cows, where they are cared for in their final years. Martin's travels take him onto Ko Yao Noi in South East Asia. He meets Sarawut, a hard working pigtail macaque monkey, one of the biggest and most agile members of the monkey family. Because they live in thick dense forests they are a spectacular climber, which makes Sarawut the ideal candidate for the job of scaling the 100 foot trees to pick coconuts. Martin goes night fishing in the Nagara River in Japan where cormorant fishermen have worked for more than 1300 years. He meets Tetsuji Yamashita, one of only six imperial fishermen in the world.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nIn the second programme, Martin looks at how pet ownership in Japan is scaling new heights of intensity. For many years there have been more dogs and cats than children. Now more than 24 million cats and dogs share the pavements of Japan's already crowded cities. Martin learns the poignant story behind the statue of a dog called Hachiko in the heart of Tokyo which symbolises just how important dogs have become here, and all over the world. Martin meets a man who has dedicated his life to rehabilitating abandoned dogs and putting them on the stage in Mr Uchidas Super Wan Wan Dog Circus. Although he admits to not being a lover of performing animals, Martin had to overcome his dislike of snakes to meet a snake charmer in Nepal. In an attempt to protect snakes, snake charming was banned in the 1970s. But it survives in isolated communities like the one Martin visited.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1d55747a755d5129332c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3195 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 46mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 2\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f668ba33bcc9233e7e36dfb650c236029174bef2","amp;dn":"Man.And.Beast.With.Martin.Clunes.Series.1.2of2.720p.HDTV.x264.AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f668ba33bcc9233e7e36dfb650c236029174bef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,104,186,51,188,201,35,62,126,54,223,182,80,194,54,2,145,116,190,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
