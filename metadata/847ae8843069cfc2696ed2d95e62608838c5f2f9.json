Economic changes in sixteenth-century ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â€the rapid expansion of trade routes and a growing class of consumersÃ¢â‚¬â€are thus intricately bound up with the evolution of the image itself. Pictures and Visuality in Early Modern China will be a touchstone for students of Chinese history, art, and culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:847ae8843069cfc2696ed2d95e62608838c5f2f9","amp;dn":"Pictures+and+Visuality+in+Early+Modern+China+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"847ae8843069cfc2696ed2d95e62608838c5f2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,122,232,132,48,105,207,194,105,110,210,217,94,98,96,136,56,197,242,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
