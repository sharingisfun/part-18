In addition to a long-running solo career the Buckinghamshire-born guitarist has been a recording musician since the early 1970s via membership of such groups as Whitesnake, UFO, Wild Turkey, Babe Ruth, Paice Ashton &amp; Lord, Cozy PowellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hammer, Alaska, M3 and many more. Though thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tendency to pigeonhole him as a blues-rock guitarist, each of MarsdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acts had its own individual flavour.\n\nAlthough Marsden was wary of flooding the credits with too many special guests, Ã¢â‚¬ËœShineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ does feature some extremely well-known names, from Joe Bonamassa to Whitesnake singer David Coverdale and the Deep Purple duo of Ian Paice (drums) and Don Airey (keyboards). Jimmy Copley of Jeff Beck fame behind the kit and Mark Feltham of Nine Below Zero also supplies some breathtaking harmonica playing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie MarsdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœShineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ explores a wide ranging musical horizon including a cleverly updated blues, slick AOR, kick ass boogie, riff driven and twin guitar rock, a steaming bluesy shuffle and a book-ended instrumental. By his own admission Ã¢â‚¬ËœShineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ includes some stockpiled material, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subtly shaped, polished and nicely sequenced by his former Alaska band member turned producer Rob Kass.\n\nRecorded in studio 3 in Abbey Road (where the Beatles cut Ã¢â‚¬ËœRevolverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), Ã¢â‚¬ËœShineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sparkles with confident songs, sumptuous guitar tones, potent harmonies, magisterial playing and BernieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best ever lead vocals. Producer Rob Kass strikes the prefect balance between the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s song driven focus and the possibilities that an array of guests Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including David Coverdale, Jimmy Copley, Ian Paice, Don Airey Cherry Lee Mewis, Joe Bonamassa and Mark Feltham Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a big studio offers him. Ã¢â‚¬ËœShineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a coherent album that plays to BernieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been a consummate guitarist and a prodigious song-writer, but a combination of different vocals textures injects the steely arrangements with style and gusto.\n\nListen for example, to the airy, west coast vocal sweep of Danny KirwanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœDragonflyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ included here as an ode to Peter Green Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the standout title track. The Cream style vocal harmonies are underpinned by Ian PaiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pounding stick work and topped by Don AireyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keyboard riffs and BonamassaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scintillating solo. All the elements coalesce seamlessly as if building to a naturally defining moment on the track. But this is such a well paced album that the final four tracks find their sequential place as part of an integral whole, before coming to rest on BernieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acoustic instrumental outro.\n\n\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœShineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ opens with a sledgehammer groove of LeadbellyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœLininÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ TrackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which mirrors the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrical muscularity, while the hot picking on Ã¢â‚¬ËœWedding DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has a Sonny Landreth feel, as part of an enveloping production. The keyboard led Ã¢â‚¬ËœWalk AwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ almost sounds out of place with its 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s keyboard motif and uplifting hook, except itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sister track to the eco message and vocal tour de force, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWho Do We Think We AreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The kick ass boogie and ZZ Top influenced Ã¢â‚¬ËœKinda Wish She WouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is effectively a counterweight as BernieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slightly distorted vocal gives the track an extra bit of edge on a riff driven rocker with huge radio potential.\n\nThe guests all make their mark, as Mark FelthamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrical harp line colours the extended groove of Ã¢â‚¬ËœLadyfriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, as it smolders, sparkles and envelops you. It sets things up nicely for the percussive reworking of Ã¢â‚¬ËœTroubleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ predicated on David Coverdale guttural phrasing. Bernie has never been reticent to explore his back catalogue and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rarely bettered himself than on this blast from the past. Cherry Lee Mewis adds gritty vocal contrast on the laid back blues-rocker Ã¢â‚¬ËœBad BloodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and just when you think the whole album has run its course on the hook laden Ã¢â‚¬ËœYou Better RunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Bernie launches himself into a dirt tone wah-wah inflected Americana shuffle Ã¢â‚¬ËœHoxie RollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ TimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which is surely destined to become a live favourite. Ã¢â‚¬ËœShineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a career high for Bernie Marsden. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an album glued together by his own deeply embedded imprint of harmony driven songs with significant hooks and burning solos. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost as if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s successfully pursued his own mission statement of cutting a definitive solo album. It may have taken him 40 odd years but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been worth the wait. ****\n\nDiscography:\n1975 Babe Ruth: Stealin' home\n1976 Babe Ruth: Kid's Stuff\n1977 Paice, Ashton &amp; Lord: Malice in Wonderland\n1978 Whitesnake: Snakebite\n1978 Whitesnake: Trouble\n1979 Bernie Marsden: And About Time, Too!\n1979 Whitesnake: Love Hunter\n1979 Whitesnake: Live at Hammersmith\n1980 Whitesnake: Ready &amp; Willing\n1981 Whitesnake: Live in the Heart of the City\n1981 Bernie Marsden: Look at Me Now\n1981 Cozy Powell: Tilt\n1982 Whitesnake: Come An' Get It\n1982 Jon Lord: Before I Forget\n1983 Whitesnake: Saints &amp; Sinners\n1984 Alaska: Heart of the Storm\n1985 Alaska: The Pack\n1988 Guitar Speak 2\n1990 Forcefield IV: Let The Wild Run Free\n1992 Ashton, Lord &amp; Paice: BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert\n1992 Bernie Marsden: Friday Rock Show Sessions\n1992 Moody Marsden Band: Never Turn Our Back On The Blues\n1993 UFO: The Decca Years\n1994 Walter Trout: Tellin' Stories\n1994 Moody Marsden Band: Unplugged Live in Hell\n1994 Moody Marsden Band: Real Faith\n1994 Moody Marsden Band: The Time Is Right For Live\n1994 Borderline Line: Up\n1995 Green and Blues\n1996 And About Time, Too!\n1997 Cozy Powell: Very Best of Cozy Powell\n1998 The Snakes: Live in Europe\n1998 The Snakes: Once Bitten\n2000 Moody Marsden Band: The Nights the Guitars Came to play\n2000 Moody Marsden Band Ozone Friendly (reissue Real Faith)\n2000 Micky Moody: I eat them for Breakfast\n2001 Company of Snakes: Here they go again\n2002 Company of Snakes: Burst the Bubble\n\nimage\n\nLine-Up:\nBernie Marsden (Guitar/Vocals)\n\nFriends:\nDavid Coverdale\nDon Airey\nIan Paice\nJoe Bonamassa\nJimmy Copley\nCherry Lee Mewis\nMark Feltham\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Bernie Marsden\nAlbum: Shine\nGenre: Rock / Blues / Hard Rock\nCountry of origin: UK\nYear: 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nCurrent Label: Mascot Records\nQuality: 320kb's\nSize: 131mbs\nIncluded: Front Cover\n\n\nTracklist\n01.
