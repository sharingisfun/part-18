The Eraser\n2. Analyse\n3. The Clock\n4. Black Swan\n5. Skip Divided\n6. Atoms for Peace\n7. And It Rained All Night\n8. Harrowdown Hill\n9. Cymbal Rush\n\nThe debut solo effort from the Radiohead frontman, &amp;#039;TheEraser&amp;#039; delivers elements of &amp;#039;Kid A&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Amnesiac&amp;#039; as well as drawing from contemporaries such as Aphex Twin. Produced andarranged bylong-time Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, &amp;#039;The Eraser&amp;#039; gives Yorke the freedom to move further into the realms of electronica whilst retaining the melody-driven style of Radiohead.\n\nBrilliant album, but very few torrents of it and any that are out there seem to have problems with the second track &quot;Analyse&quot;, sometimes it&amp;#039;s in a different format and it&amp;#039;s missing the first few seconds, missing the intro of the song, kind of annoying, hence this torrent which doesn&amp;#039;t have that missing part of the track. \n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffee11ccfc0b6d40a10e055acca17a267da1f2cb","amp;dn":"Thom+Yorke+-+The+Eraser+%28192kb+mp3%2C+complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffee11ccfc0b6d40a10e055acca17a267da1f2cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,238,17,204,252,11,109,64,161,14,5,90,204,161,122,38,125,161,242,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
