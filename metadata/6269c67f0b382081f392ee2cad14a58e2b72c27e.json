The story centers around the lives of Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend Armin Arlert, who live in a world where the remnants of the human population live inside cities surrounded by enormous walls due to the sudden appearance of the Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures who devour humans seemingly without reason. Their lives are changed forever after the appearance of a colossal Titan brings about the destruction of their home town and the death of Eren's mother, spurring them to enter the army to battle the Titans themselves.\nAn anime television series debuted on April 6, 2013, on MBS.[Note 1] A live action film adaptation is also in production. Four video game adaptations developed by Nitroplus staffers in collaboration with Production I.G were announced to be released as bonus content for the third and sixth volumes of the Blu-ray Disc release of the anime.\nThe manga series has become a commercial success, selling over 20 million volumes as of mid 2013. The release of the anime also saw a boost in the series' popularity with several writers critically acclaiming for its atmosphere and story. Although it also gained fame in neighboring Asian countries, the series's themes have been a subject of controversy.\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 1 - To You, After 2,000 Years The Fall of Shiganshina, Part 1\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 2 - That Day The Fall of Shiganshina, Part 2\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 3 - A Dim Light in the Darkness of Despair Mankind's Comeback, Part 1\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 4 - Night of the Graduation Ceremony Mankind's Comeback, Part 2\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 5 - First Battle Battle of Trost District, Part 1\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 6 - The World She Saw Battle of Trost District, Part 2\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 7 - The Tiny Blade Battle of Trost District, Part 3\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 8 - I Can Hear a Heartbeat Battle of Trost District, Part 4\nShingeki no kyojin Episode 9 - The Left Arm's Trace Battle of Trost District, Part 5\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 10 - Answer Battle of Trost District, Part 6\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 11 - Icon Battle of Trost District, Part 7\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 12 - Wound Battle of Trost District, Part 8\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 13 - Primal Desires Battle of Trost District, Part 9\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 13.5 - Since That Day\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 14 - Can't Look Into His Eyes Prelude to the Counterattack, Part 1\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 15 - Special Operations Squad Prelude to the Counterattack, Part 2\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 16 - What to Do Now Prelude to the Counterattack, Part 3\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 17 - Female Titan 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls, Part 1\nShingeki no Kyojin Episode 18 - Forest of Giant Trees 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls, Part 2\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6269c67f0b382081f392ee2cad14a58e2b72c27e","amp;dn":"Shingeki+no+Kyojin+1-18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6269c67f0b382081f392ee2cad14a58e2b72c27e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,105,198,127,11,56,32,129,243,146,238,44,173,20,165,142,43,114,194,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
