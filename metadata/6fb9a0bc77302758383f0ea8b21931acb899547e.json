Love as the fabric of existence itself. Seeing the number 11:11 repeatedly. Increasing your manifestation power by dropping expectation. Examples of core beliefs. The psychological impact of contact with accelerated ET's. Did Judas betray Jesus? Losing one's passion for living. Belief that you wont' be loved and the self perpetuating nature of beliefs. The illusion of power vs. the power of the illusion. Positive ways of parenting teenagers. Orbs in photographs, what they are and why they are here. Out of body experience on a space craft.
