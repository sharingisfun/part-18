Referred to as the King of Pop, Jackson is recognized as the most successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records. His contribution to music, dance and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5 in the mid-1960s, and began his solo career in 1971.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs including &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, were credited with transforming the medium into an art form and a promotional tool, and the popularity of these videos helped to bring the relatively new television channel MTV to fame. Videos such as &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; made him a staple on MTV in the 1990s. Through stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk. His distinctive musical sound and vocal style have influenced numerous hip hop, pop, contemporary R&amp;B and rock artists.\n\nJackson's 1982 album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. His other records, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991) and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling. Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame as the first (and currently only) dancer from the world of pop and rock 'n' roll. Some of his other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records; 13 Grammy Awards (as well as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award); 26 American Music Awards (more than any other artist, including the &quot;Artist of the Century&quot;); 13 number-one singles in the United States in his solo career (more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era); and the estimated sale of over 750 million records worldwide. Jackson won hundreds of awards, which have made him one of the most-awarded recording artist in the history of music. He was also a notable humanitarian and philanthropist, donating and raising hundreds of millions of dollars for beneficial causes and supporting more than 39 charities.\n\nAspects of Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships and behavior, have generated controversy. In 1993, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the case was settled out of court and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury ruled him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his concert series This Is It, Jackson died on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. Before his death, Jackson had reportedly been administered drugs such as propofol and lorazepam. The Los Angeles County Coroner declared his death a homicide, and his personal physician pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and as many as one billion people around the world reportedly watched his public memorial service on live television. In March 2010, Sony Music Entertainment signed a US$250 million deal with Jackson's estate to retain distribution rights to his recordings until 2017, and to release seven posthumous albums over the decade following his death. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDangerous 1991\n\n\nDangerous is the eighth studio album by Michael Jackson, released on November 26, 1991. It became his second to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, where it spent the next four consecutive weeks. The album has sold over 32 million copies worldwide.[2] The album won one Grammy for Best Engineered Album - Non Classical won by Bruce Swedien &amp; Teddy Riley[3] and is the most successful new jack swing album of all time.\n\n\nAccording to the sleeve notes on the later remastered edition of the album, recording sessions began in Los Angeles, California at Ocean Way/Record One Studio 2 on June 25, 1990. The sessions ended at Larrabee North and Ocean Way Studio on October 29, 1991, being the most extensive recording project of Jackson's career at the time (over 16 months compared to the usual 6 spent for his previous three studio albums).\n\nIn March 1991, Jackson signed a 15 year, 6 album deal to Sony Music. The press reported that Sony actually handed over $1 billion to Jackson, but that was not the case. At the time, Sony estimated that if the albums Jackson released under the new contract sold at the same level they currently sold, it would generate over $1 billion in profits for them. Additionally, Jackson was awarded the highest royalty rate in the business. By the time the contract expired in March 2006, Michael would have been paid $45 million from Sony ($1 million a year, plus $5 million per album delivered). This does not include money he would have also earned from sales of albums, singles, videos etc. Under this contract, Jackson is estimated to have earned $175 million from album sales alone.\n\nAt this point, Dangerous was already in the making, under the producing talents of (Quincy Jones recommended) 23-year-old Teddy Riley and Grammy-winner Bill Bottrell. The previous album, Bad, was Jackson's last designed for the LP industry, conforming to the usual 10-song within 50-minute format, whereas Dangerous was a 77-minute, 14-track compilation, which almost dared the capacity of early Nineties compact discs. Consequently, the record was released as a double album in vinyl.\n\nDangerous was a highly anticipated album, as shown by an incident at the Los Angeles International Airport, where a group of armed robbers stole 30,000 copies before its official release. Because of this, more early copies of the album were released in several countries on November 25 followed by the official November 26 release date.[\n\nDangerous was released on November 26, 1991 with record-breaking sales.[clarification needed] Dangerous was Jackson's fastest-selling album ever in the United States with seven million shipped in under two months. This broke the sales record for Bad, which had also shipped seven million copies in 1987, but in four months.\n\nDangerous dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©buted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 Album Charts, with 326,500 copies sold in its first week. It held the position for four weeks. Jackson promoted the album with a high-profile performance at the Super Bowl and an interview with Oprah Winfrey, but it did not return to the No. 1 slot. However, it returned to the Top Ten after Jackson received the Grammy Legend Award at the 1993 ceremony. Dangerous spent 117 weeks in the Billboard 200, thirty more than Bad. The RIAA certified Dangerous seven times platinum (seven million copies).[12]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©buted at No. 1, holding off U2's Achtung Baby, but in the second week it was replaced by Queen's Greatest Hits II. Dangerous spent 23 weeks in the Top 10, and a total of 96 weeks on the Top 75 chart.\n\n&quot;Black or White&quot; was produced and co-written by Bill Bottrell. The single was Jackson's biggest hit since 1983's &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. In all, nine singles were released, spanning two years (1991ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1993). A planned single release of the title track &quot;Dangerous&quot; was canceled in late 1993 due to child molestation allegations. Seven singles reached the UK Top 10, the most for any Jackson album.\n\n48% of Bad's worldwide sales were in the UK and US; for Dangerous, the total was 33%, reflecting Jackson's growing global reach. For the most part, the singles from Dangerous were bigger hits in Europe and Australia than in the United States. Dangerous sold very well in both Asia and South America, two emerging and growing record markets, and was supported by the Dangerous World Tour. Prior to the release of Jackson's next studio album, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, Dangerous had already sold over twenty-two million copies worldwide.[13] In the space of 17 years, sources estimate the record has sold between 30 and 32 million copies worldwide making it a faster selling album than his previous record Bad.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Jam&quot; (featuring Heavy D)\n2.\t&quot;Why You Wanna Trip on Me&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;In the Closet&quot; (featuring Mystery Girl)\n4.\t&quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot; (featuring Wreckx-n-Effect)\n5.\t&quot;Remember the Time&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Heal the World&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Black or White&quot; (featuring L.T.B.)\n9.\t&quot;Who Is It&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Give In to Me&quot; (featuring Slash)\n11.\t&quot;Will You Be There&quot; (Theme from Free Willy)\n12.\t&quot;Keep the Faith&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Gone Too Soon&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Dangerous&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543286eec3e45933e3536237b7b54c428bba9970","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Dangerous+1991+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543286eec3e45933e3536237b7b54c428bba9970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,50,134,238,195,228,89,51,227,83,98,55,183,181,76,66,139,186,153,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
