Although the album contains two of the group's finest singles in &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; and &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople),&quot; the overall record is uneven, since the group's hooks aren't quite as sharp as before and the humor is either too geeky or leavened with awkward social statements like &quot;Your Racist Friend.&quot; Even with its faults, Flood has a number of first-rate songs, and it's a strong addition to their catalog, even if it isn't as weirdly intoxicating as its predecessors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd05362b5bc405764800c2a542beddaa174ee1ae","amp;dn":"They+Might+Be+Giants+-+Flood+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd05362b5bc405764800c2a542beddaa174ee1ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,5,54,43,91,196,5,118,72,0,194,165,66,190,221,170,23,78,225,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
