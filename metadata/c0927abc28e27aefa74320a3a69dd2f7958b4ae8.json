A Las Vegas institution for ove five decades, his often risque stories are softened by his unique delivery. In the 80's HBO and premium cable service was &quot;the new thing.&quot; Concerned that 'giving away' his act on cable would hurt his business at live venues, Hackett was slow to agree. HBO courted Buddy for close to a year before the deal was struck and the date was set. Always a pioneer, the king of stand-up comedy performed before a live audience in a first-of-its-kind, Comedy Special for the cameras of HBO. The program was nominated for a Cable Ace Award. Hackett was as hot as ever. On the heels of much acclaim, Buddy and HBO paired again in '85 recording Buddy Hackett Live and Uncensored 2 which is being offered on this listing Recorded at Caesars Atlantic City October 1985 DIGITALLY RE-MASTERED 55 Minutes of Bonus Material Concert: Running Time: 59 minutes Las Vegas Spotlight: Buddy interviewed by son Sandy Hackett And another bonus this DVD also includes an episode of STANLEY: Buddy's 1956-57 Sit Com Audience Warm-Up Celia's Pen Pal: Episode #9 - Original Air Date: 12/3/56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0927abc28e27aefa74320a3a69dd2f7958b4ae8","amp;dn":"Buddy+Hackett+-+Live+%26amp%3B+Uncensored+02+%5B1985%5D+HBO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0927abc28e27aefa74320a3a69dd2f7958b4ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,146,122,188,40,226,122,239,167,67,32,163,166,157,210,247,149,139,74,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
