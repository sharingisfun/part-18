His beloved grandmother, Cedella Marley Booker, who went home to Zion in 2008, inspires the young songwriter. Awake is a call for everyone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ youths and elders ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to awaken to lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s joy and rewards and to do something positive with their lives. The roots-reggae sound that Julian Marley has distinctly made his own is supported by the street-energy infusion of hip-hop, bubbling dancehall, and a smooth combination of R&amp;B and reggae.\n\nTracklist:\n01.
