Their three best known songs are &quot;Keep On Running&quot;, a number one in\nthe UK Singles Chart written by reggae musician Jackie Edwards; and &quot;Gimme\nSome Lovin'&quot; and &quot;I'm a Man&quot;.\n\nWinwood left in 1967, to form Traffic before joining Blind Faith, then forging a\ncareer as a soloist. After releasing a few more singles the band ceased activity in\n1968. Davis started a new group in 2006, although only Davis remains from the\n1960s line-ups\n\nThe Spencer Davis Group was formed in 1963 in Birmingham when Welsh\nguitarist Spencer Davis recruited vocalist and organist Steve Winwood and his\nbass playing brother Muff Winwood. The group was completed with Pete York on\ndrums.Originally called the Rhythm and Blues Quartette, the band performed\nregularly in the city. They signed their first recording contract after Chris\nBlackwell of Island Records saw them at an appearance in a local club; Blackwell\nalso became their producer.\n\nThe group's first professional recording was a cover version of &quot;Dimples&quot;, but they\ncame to success at the end of 1965 with &quot;Keep On Running&quot;, the group's first\nnumber one single. In 1966, they followed this with &quot;Somebody Help Me&quot; and\n&quot;When I Come Home&quot;. For the German market the group released &quot;Det war in\nSchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶neberg, im Monat Mai&quot; and &quot;MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤del ruck ruck ruck an meine grÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ne Seite&quot; (the\nfirst is from a 1913 Berlin operetta, the second is a Swabian traditional) as a tribute\nsingle for that audience, Davis having studied in West Berlin in the early 1960s. By\nthe end of 1966 and the beginning of 1967, the group released two more hits,\n&quot;Gimme Some Lovin'&quot; and &quot;I'm a Man&quot;. Both of them sold over one million copies,\nand were awarded gold disc status. These tracks proved to be their two bestknown\nsuccesses, especially in the U.S. Jimmy Miller was their producer.\n\nIn 1967, Winwood left to form Traffic; his brother Muff moved into the music\nindustry as A&amp;R man at Island Records. In a joint venture, the soundtrack to the\nfilm Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush featured both the Spencer Davis Group\nand Traffic. After the Winwoods' departure, the Spencer Davis Group regrouped\nwith the addition of guitarist Phil Sawyer (ex-Les Fleur de Lys) and\nkeyboardist/vocalist Eddie Hardin (ex-A Wild Uncertainty) This line-up recorded\nseveral tunes for Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush and released the &quot;Time\nSeller&quot; single in July 1967; the b-side, &quot;Don't Want You No More,&quot; also received\nradio\n\n\n01.
