Described as &quot;the best rock &amp; roll album to come out of England's original beat boom of the late 1950s&quot;, every one of the ten songs was written by Fury, whereas the debut albums of most artists contain covers of already-popular songs. Fury was arguably the first British rock 'n roll artist to write his own songs, sometimes under the pseudonym Wilbur Wilberforce.\nThe album was recorded in Decca Studio 3, West Hampstead, London, on 14 April 1960. It featured Joe Brown on guitar, Reg Guest on piano, and bassists Bill Stark or Alan Weighell. Andy White, known for his performance in The Beatles' first single &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, is the drummer on the album. Providing backing vocals were the Four Jays\nThe album made the top twenty, reaching position 18 on the UK Albums Chart for a week. It was not well appreciated at the time of its release, but is now regarded as one of the most important early British rock 'n roll albums. \n\n01. That's Love\n02. My Advice\n03. Phone Call\n04.
