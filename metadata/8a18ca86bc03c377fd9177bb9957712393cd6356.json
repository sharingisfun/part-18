Just as ominously, especially for those who share the values and views of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, at no other time have religious fundamentalists effectively had veto power over one of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two major political parties. As Sean Faircloth argues in this deeply sobering yet highly engaging book, this has led to the crumbling of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most cherished founding principleÃ¢â‚¬â€the wall of separation between church and state. While much of the public debate in the United States over church-state issues has focused on the construction of nativity scenes in town squares and the addition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“under GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the Pledge, Faircloth, a former politician, moves beyond the symbolism to explore the many ways federal and state legal codes privilege religion in law. He demonstrates in vivid detail how religious bias in law harms all AmericansÃ¢â‚¬â€financially, militarily, physically, socially, and educationallyÃ¢â‚¬â€and directs special attention to the outlandish words, views, and policy proposals of the most theocratic members of Congress, a group he labels the Fundamentalist Fifty. Sounding a much-needed alarm for all who care about the future direction of the country, Faircloth concludes by offering an inspiring ten-point vision of an America returned to its secular roots and by providing a specific and sensible plan for realizing this vision. Both his vision and his plan remember and remind that the United States is, above all else, one nation under the Constitution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a18ca86bc03c377fd9177bb9957712393cd6356","amp;dn":"Attack+of+the+Theocrats","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a18ca86bc03c377fd9177bb9957712393cd6356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,24,202,134,188,3,195,119,253,145,119,187,153,87,113,35,147,205,99,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
