Toback&amp;#039;s &quot;Black and White&quot; gave us the freshest recent perspective on hip college life and how kids deal with identity in today&amp;#039;s rapid paced, morally ambiguous, sexually charged, multi-cultural society. &quot;Harvard Man&quot; is also played out against a background of love, sex, basketball, crime and experimentation. It is an ambitious work of action, philosophy and cinematic content that explores what today&amp;#039;s young people go through on their quest to discover their true identity.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar plays a Holy Cross cheerleader named Cindy who is dating the point guard for the Harvard basketball team. Her father is a mob boss, and she gets her boyfriend Alan (played by Adrian Grenier) mixed up in sports betting. Joey Lauren Adams plays Alan&amp;#039;s philosophy professor with whom Alan&amp;#039;s got something going on the side. Eric Stoltz is an undercover FBI agent infiltrating Cindy&amp;#039;s father&amp;#039;s mafia operations. Rebecca Gayheart plays Stoltz&amp;#039; co-FBI agent/girlfriend, and Ray Allen plays Grenier&amp;#039;s Harvard teammate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a132b008e1cd5c7d419cdd85011c562943fe94","amp;dn":"Harvard.Man.2001.DivX-QiX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a132b008e1cd5c7d419cdd85011c562943fe94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,161,50,176,8,225,205,92,125,65,156,221,133,1,28,86,41,67,254,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
