An 8-year-old American boy wakes up alone in a rice paddy in a rural Chinese province with no idea how he got there.

The home he claims as his own is occupied by an elderly couple, Harold and Lucille Garland, who lost their son Jacob more than 30 years ago. While they look different, young Jacob recognizes them as his parents.
