In this spirit, the XP conference continued its fine tradition of promoting agility by disseminating new research results in a timely manner and by bringing together researchers and practitioners for a fruitful mutual exchange of experiences. As introduced for XP 2010, there were again two different program committees, one for research papers and one for experience reports. Regarding the research papers, 11 out of 56 submissions were accepted as full papers; and as far as the experience reports were concerned, the respective number was 4 out of 17 submissions. In addition to these papers, this volume also includes the short research papers, the abstracts of the posters, the position papers of the PhD symposium, and the abstracts of the workshops.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49608b19c90734bf97c1773ab23cdb9260de35fc","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Agile+Processes+in+Software+Engineering+and+Extreme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49608b19c90734bf97c1773ab23cdb9260de35fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,96,139,25,201,7,52,191,151,193,119,58,178,60,219,146,96,222,53,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
