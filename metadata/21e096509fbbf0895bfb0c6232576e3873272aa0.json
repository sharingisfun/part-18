Devil (MANNY GOODTIMES) hasn't       \n    secured a fresh soul since Adolph Hitler. His wife, Saturna (IMA         \n    GHOUL), is needling him to get off his pointed posterior and spring      \n    back into action.                                                        \n                                                                             \n    When Ben-Hur Ova (burlesque comedian LITTLE JACK LITTLE, looking like    \n    nearly every New York City hot dog vendor I've ever seen) is voted       \n    the 'World's Most Faithful Husband' by Ladies House Companion            \n    magazine, Lucifer is challenged by the claim that no earthly             \n    temptation can lure Ben away from his loving spouse, Miassis (BEA        \n    REDDY). 'I'll have him cheating on his wife within two shakes of a       \n    sinner's tail,' the Devil vows.                                          \n                                                                             \n    Lucifer tries to corrupt the hapless hubby with lots of nubile (and      \n    naked) lovelies, but to no avail. It turns out that Ben is a visiting    \n    Arabian sheik with a harem outnumbering the chorus line at Radio City    \n    Music Hall; tempting this noodnik with babes is like tempting an         \n    Eskimo with an air conditioner...                                        \n                                                                             \n    Directed by PETER PERRY (Kiss Me Quick) and produced by noted            \n    exploitation film distributor DAN SONNEY ('Money by Sonney'), My Tale    \n    is Hot (a.k.a. Always on Monday and Panties Inferno) is a typically      \n    silly sixties nudie cutie. (It's billed as a 'fanny-see in living        \n    Skin-a-Scope' with the cast listed 'in order of exposure.' Har-de        \n    har-har.) The threadbare plot is liberally peppered with                 \n    elbow-in-the-ribs humor, most of it courtesy of Little Jack Little,      \n    the diminutive veteran of burleycue and nudie cutie films (Not           \n    Tonight Henry!, Everybody Loves It).                                     \n                                                                             \n    Even by skinflick standards, the production values are more              \n    impoverished than usual but the budgetary deficiency is a moot point,    \n    really, because nude cutie producers weren't concerned about anything    \n    as trivial as cinematic 'art.' They just wanted to exhibit as much       \n    female flesh as they could get away with. And the epidermal count        \n    here is quite high.                                                      \n                                                                             \n    But My Tale is Hot's chief claim to fame is a four-minute dance          \n    routine showcasing legendary stripper CANDY BARR. This footage (circa    \n    1956) is randomly inserted into the proceedings, earning her a           \n    'Special Guest Star' billing and allowing the filmmakers to exploit      \n    her notoriety. (She made national headlines when a marijuana bust        \n    landed her in prison.) In contrast to Lili St. Cyr and Tempest Storm,    \n    both of whom made numerous features and shorts, there's very little      \n    footage that exists of the busty, baby faced Miss Barr, and almost       \n    nothing of her strip act. Discounting the infamous stag reel Smart       \n    Aleck and a few nudie loops, Candy's film output was virtually           \n    nonexistent, so her dance routine in this film should be of great        \n    interest to striptease scholars everywhere.                              \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
