Brazilian artists have often been quite adept at \n\ncreating music that has light and delicate qualities, but never degenerates into 'elevator muzak.'  Like the bossa nova of the '60s, \n\nCrazy Rhythm is 'easy listening' music with a difference -- some of it was soft enough for airplay on 'quiet storm' and 'smooth jazz' \n\nradio, but nothing on this CD comes across as contrived or calculated.  Jose Roberto Bertrami delivers one of the finest solos of \n\nhis career on the beautiful and enchanting 'Diza,' and special guest Joe Pass (guitar) is in fine form on 'Tropical Horizon' and \n\n'Hobalala.' ~ Alex Henderson, AMG\n\n'While in the post fusion years when lite jazz was beginning to take off a lot of jazz and fusion artists got a bit lost, Azymuth \n\ncontinued to make a number of fine recordings, some of the best of their career.  Bertrami and crew continue to groove along in \n\ntheir tight Brazilian fusion mode, with a spacious airiness and a wonderful modern groove.  We especially dig the mellow grooves \n\nof 'Tropical Horizon' and 'Diza', while the acoustic and vocal number 'Tempo A Bessa' is also quite nice.  Also includes 'Bossa \n\nNova USA', 'O Pescador' and 'Hobalala'. ' \n\nPersonnel:\nJ.R.
