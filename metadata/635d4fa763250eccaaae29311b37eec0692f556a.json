Titian is known above all for his remarkable use of color; his painterly approach was highly influential well into the seventeenth century. Titian contributed to all of the major areas of Renaissance art, painting altarpieces, portraits, mythologies, and pastoral landscapes with figures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:635d4fa763250eccaaae29311b37eec0692f556a","amp;dn":"The+World+of+Titian+1488-1576+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"635d4fa763250eccaaae29311b37eec0692f556a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,93,79,167,99,37,14,204,170,174,41,49,27,55,238,192,105,47,85,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
