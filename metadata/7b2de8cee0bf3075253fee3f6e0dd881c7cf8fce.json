By simply varying your playing velocity, you can put together beautiful sounding melodic lines that sound like a recording of someone playing an actual Native American flute. The flutes of MesaWinds are truly a joy to play. When you combine carefully played velocities with all of the other levels of control, you can achieve a sound that is almost indistinguishable from a live performance...All in all, MesaWinds is easy to download, install, load, and play, and the flute sounds are absolutely sublime. You can definitely get lost in the beatiful sounds of MesaWinds.&quot; - Wusik Sound Magazine\n\nMesaWindsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is an extensively-sampled collection of six Native American Flutes in a variety of different ranges. The library features a powerful scripting engine that gives these flutes unparalleled realism, and instant playability. This is achieved by intelligently interpreting MIDI data, whether you're playing live from your MIDI keyboard or controlling it from your sequencer. We've also included controls to customize the built-in environments to change the tone of the flutes. The mapping is also completely dynamic, allowing you to move the articulation keyswitches to whichever keys are most convenient for you.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Over 3.6 GB of 96 kHz, 24-bit samples\n- Up to 4x round-robin\n- Multiple velocity layers\n- Vibrato and non-vibrato samples\n- Realistic legato between notes\n- Fluttertonguing, fall releases, grace notes, and more\n\nFormat:\n\nDue to the extensive scripting, this sample library is available in KONTAKT 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 format only.
