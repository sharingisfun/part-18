It has good points and teachable moments, but I'm not a religious person. I dont think facts like math, numbers and finance should be mixed with religion. There are just too many questions in religion.\n\nAnyway this book was referred by Dave Ramsey, so I decided to check it out. \n\n\nThe quality is only 64kbps, but its an audio book, so its not bad at all.\nIf I had to guess this book was ripped from audio cassette.\n\nEnjoy\nSmeary Deva\n\n\nFile Type: mp3\nBit Rate: 64kbps\n\nBook Description\nPublication Date: August 22, 2008 - Audio Cassette December 1, 2003\n\nHaving clear boundaries is essential to a healthy, balanced lifestyle. A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words, boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend offer biblically-based answers to these and other tough questions, showing us how to set healthy boundaries with our parents, spouses, children, friends, co-workers, and even ourselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9dbe8d07c9724691d19200878847524a634a49f","amp;dn":"Boundaries+When+To+Say+Yes%2C+How+to+Say+No+2008+by+Henry+Cloud+%26a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9dbe8d07c9724691d19200878847524a634a49f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,219,232,208,124,151,36,105,29,25,32,8,120,132,117,36,166,52,164,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
