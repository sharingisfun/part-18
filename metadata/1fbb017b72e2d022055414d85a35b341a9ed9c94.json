There are no more fines for bad behaviorÃ¢â‚¬â€instead, there are arrests, trials, and maybe worse. People who get arrested usually don't come back.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Ember Miller is old enough to remember that things weren't always this way. Living with her rebellious single mother, it's hard for her to forget that people weren't always arrested for reading the wrong books or staying out after dark. It's hard to forget that life in the United States used to be different.\n\nEmber has perfected the art of keeping a low profile. She knows how to get the things she needs, like food stamps and hand-me-down clothes, and how to pass the random home inspections by the military. Her life is as close to peaceful as circumstances allow.\n\nThat is, until her mother is arrested for noncompliance with Article 5 of the Moral Statutes. And one of the arresting officers is none other than Chase JenningsÃ¢â‚¬â€the only boy Ember has ever loved.\n\nBreaking Point (Article 5 #2) by Kristen Simmons (February 12th 2013)\n\nThe second installment in Kristen Simmons's fast-paced, gripping YA dystopian series.\n\nAfter faking their deaths to escape from prison, Ember Miller and Chase Jennings have only one goal: to lay low until the Federal Bureau of Reformation forgets they ever existed.\n\nNear-celebrities now for the increasingly sensationalized tales of their struggles with the government, Ember and Chase are recognized and taken in by the ResistanceÃ¢â‚¬â€an underground organization working to systematically take down the government. At headquarters, all eyes are on the sniper, an anonymous assassin taking out FBR soldiers one by one. Rumors are flying about the sniperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true identity, and Ember and Chase welcome the diversionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nUntil the government posts its most-wanted list, and their number one suspect is Ember herself.\n\nOrders are shoot to kill, and soldiers are cleared to fire on suspicion alone. Suddenly Ember canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even step onto the street without fear of being recognized, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“laying lowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a joke. Even members of the Resistance are starting to look at her sideways.\n\nWith Chase urging her to run, Ember must decide: Go into hidingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or fight back?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fbb017b72e2d022055414d85a35b341a9ed9c94","amp;dn":"Article+5+Series+%281-2%29+by+Kristen+Simmons+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fbb017b72e2d022055414d85a35b341a9ed9c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,187,1,123,114,226,208,34,5,84,20,216,90,53,179,65,169,237,156,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
