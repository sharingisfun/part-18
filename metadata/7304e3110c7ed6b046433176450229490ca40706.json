While this is not the case, the 2004-2005 season of hip-hop is more than enough fertile ground for a satisfying and diverse rap record. THE SOURCE has captured two of the best and most original singles from that time, the blazing stutter-step of Fabolous's &quot;Breathe&quot; and Trick Daddy's Ozzy Osbourne-sampling crunk masterpiece &quot;Let's Go.&quot; The set also compiles unforgettably anthemic radio rulers like Terror Squad's &quot;Lean Back&quot; and Ciara's &quot;Goodies,&quot; while putting newcomers like Trillville (&quot;Neva Eva&quot;) and Pitbull (&quot;Dammit Man&quot;) alongside veterans like C-Murder (&quot;Y'all Heard Of Me&quot;) and the venerable Geto Boys (&quot;Yes, Yes, Y'all&quot;). This fine compilation is a satisfying snapshot of the hip-hop landscape with the genre speeding toward its fourth decade. \n\n\nTrack Listing \n\n     1\tLean Back  - Terror Squad \n     2\tNolia Clap - Juvenile, Skip and Wacko\n     3\tBreathe  - Fabolous\n     4\tGo DJ  - Lil' Wayne\n     5\tLet's Go - Trick Daddy, Lil' Jon and Twista\n     6\tHold You Down - The Alchemist, Prodigy, and Nina Sky\t\t\t\n     7\tWhat U Gon' Do  - Lil' Jon and Lil' Scrappy\t\t\t\n     8\tGoodies  - Ciara and Petey Pablo\n     9\tDammit Man  - Pitbull and Piccalo\t\t\t\n    10\tCertified Gangsta - Jim Jones, Cam'Ron and Junie Bezel\t\t\t\n    11\tNeva Eva  - Trillville, Lil' Scrappy, and Lil' Jon\t\t\t\n    12\tWide Body - Benzino and Faheim\t\t\t\n    13\tVibrate  - Petey Pablo and Rasheeda\t\t\n    14\tYes, Yes, Y'all - Geto Boys\t\t\t\n    15\tY'All Heard of Me - C-Murder and B.G.\t\t\t\n    16\tWhat's Really Good - Benzino, Young Hardy, and Scarface","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7304e3110c7ed6b046433176450229490ca40706","amp;dn":"The+Source+Presents+Hip+Hop+Hits+Volume+10+%282005%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7304e3110c7ed6b046433176450229490ca40706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,4,227,17,12,126,214,176,70,67,49,118,69,2,41,73,12,164,7,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
