His voice is the grain of every rock &amp; roll lothario\\&amp;#039;s Waterloo. \nDeVille follows this with a scorching Cuban son called \\&quot;Demasiado Corazon,\\&quot; featuring full salsa horn and percussion sections. Talk about Spanish soul, this tune burns with it; it sweats and dances with a bleeding heart full of pathos, eros, and violence. \nAs usual, though, it\\&amp;#039;s on the ballads that Willy DeVille reveals that he and his band were rock\\&amp;#039;s most diverse unit. \\&quot;Around the Corner\\&quot; and \\&quot;The Moonlight Let Me Down\\&quot; may borrow inspiration from Dan Penn and Doc Pomus, but it doesn\\&amp;#039;t matter: DeVille and his band were burning through the pages of rock and R&amp;B history (there are a couple of doo wop- and New Orleans-flavored cuts as well) with raw swagger and astonishing musicianship. Why they didn\\&amp;#039;t catch and George Thorogood did is a mystery that will be up to music historians to figure out. (AMG)\n\n\n\n01.
