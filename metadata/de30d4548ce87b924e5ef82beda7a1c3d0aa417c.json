Collected here are some of his most important essays on this influential subject. Dating back from the late 1960's to the present, they chronicle the development of Plantinga's thoughts about some of the most fundamental issues in metaphysics: what is the nature of abstract objects like possible worlds, properties, propositions, and such phenomena? Are there possible but non-actual objects? Can objects that do not exist exemplify properties? Plantinga gives thorough and penetrating answers to all of these questions and many others. This volume contains some of the best work in metaphysics from the past 30 years, and will remain a source of critical contention and keen interest among philosophers of metaphysics and philosophical logic for years to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de30d4548ce87b924e5ef82beda7a1c3d0aa417c","amp;dn":"Essays+in+the+Metaphysics+of+Modality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de30d4548ce87b924e5ef82beda7a1c3d0aa417c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,48,212,84,140,232,123,146,78,94,248,43,237,167,161,195,208,170,65,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
