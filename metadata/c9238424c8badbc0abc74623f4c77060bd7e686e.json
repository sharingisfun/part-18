Much of the focus of this book is on profiling and code testing, as well as performance optimization. It also explores much of the technology behind the Doom and Quake 3-D games, and 3-D graphics problems such as texture mapping, hidden surface removal, and the like.\n\nThis book can be freely downloaded from here: http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1698.asp\n\nBut that version is split into many parts, and has some annoying broken links at the top of many of the pages.\n\nThis version has been joined into a single pdf, and all the annoying broken links have been removed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9238424c8badbc0abc74623f4c77060bd7e686e","amp;dn":"Michael+Abrash%5C%27s+Graphics+Programming+Black+Book+%28single+PDF%2C+c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9238424c8badbc0abc74623f4c77060bd7e686e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,35,132,36,200,186,219,192,171,199,70,35,244,199,112,96,189,126,104,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
