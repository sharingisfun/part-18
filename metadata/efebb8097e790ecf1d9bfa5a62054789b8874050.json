Bond formation between surface layers of dissimilar condensed solidsÃ¢â‚¬â€termed adhesionÃ¢â‚¬â€depends on the nature of the contacting bodies. Thus, it is necessary to determine the characteristics of adhesion interaction of different materials from both applied and fundamental perspectives of surface phenomena. Given the difficulty in obtaining reliable experimental values of the adhesion strength of coatings, the theoretical approach to determining adhesion characteristics becomes more important.\n\nSurface Physics: Theoretical Models and Experimental Methods presents straightforward and efficient approaches and methods developed by the authors that enable the calculation of surface and adhesion characteristics for a wide range of materials: metals, alloys, semiconductors, and complex compounds. The authors compare results from the proposed theoriesÃ¢â‚¬â€developed within the framework of the electron density functional theory and dielectric formalismÃ¢â‚¬â€to experimental data. The book begins with a discussion of the thermodynamics of surface phenomena and covers experimental and theoretical methods for studying surface characteristics of solids.\n\nChapters describe calculations of surface and adhesion characteristics of metals using the density functional method. They also examine the calculation of adhesion characteristics of metals, semiconductors, and complex compounds based on dielectric formalism. In addition, the text covers dry friction, adsorption of metal atoms, and ferromagnetic films. The principles and methods presented in this book are useful in selecting optimum materials and coatings for various applications, including minimizing friction for increased efficiency of microelectronic components.\n\nPublisher: CRC Press (October 18, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1466594330\nISBN-13: 978-1466594333","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efebb8097e790ecf1d9bfa5a62054789b8874050","amp;dn":"%5BMarina+V.+Mamonova%2C+Vladimir+V.+Prudnikov+%2C+Irina+A.+Prudnikova","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efebb8097e790ecf1d9bfa5a62054789b8874050","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,235,184,9,126,121,14,207,29,155,250,90,98,5,71,137,184,135,64,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
