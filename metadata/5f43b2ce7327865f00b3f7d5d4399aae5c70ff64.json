In Home Cooking with Jean-Georges, he brings readers into his weekend home, where he cooks simple, delicious dishes that leave him plenty of time to enjoy the company of friends and loved ones. \nA few years ago, Jean-Georges decided to give himself a gift that most of us take for granted: two-day weekends. He and his wife, Marja, and their family retreat to their country home in Waccabuc, New York. There, the renowned chef produces the masterful, fresh flavors for which he is knownÃ¢â‚¬â€but with little effort and few dishes to clean at the end. These quick, seasonal, Vongerichten-family favorites include: Crab Toasts with Sriracha Mayonnaise, Watermelon and Blue Cheese Salad, Herbed Sea Bass and Potatoes in Broth, Lamb Chops with Smoked Chile Glaze and Warm Fava Beans, Parmesan-Crusted Chicken, Fresh Corn Pudding Cake, Tarte Tatin, and Buttermilk Pancakes with Warm Berry Syrup.\nWith 100 recipes and 100 color photographsÃ¢â‚¬â€all taken at his country houseÃ¢â‚¬â€Home Cooking with Jean-Georges will inspire home cooks with fantastic accessible dishes to add to their repertoires.\n\nAbout the Author\n&quot;The first thing you should know about me is that I'm a country boy at heart. I grew up on a farm in Alsace where my mother and grandmother taught me to eat and cook according to the seasons. It was there I fell in love with food--fresh herbs and vegetables and the warmth of our local Franco-German flavors. Though I've been living an urban life since 1973, I'm still most at home in the country.\nSince my departure from Alsace, I've lived, trained, and cooked all over France, in Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, Boston, and New York. Now, I'm rooted in New York, in my little Perry Street neighborhood and in the hills of Westchester County. But I also feel at home in my other restaurants around the world.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f43b2ce7327865f00b3f7d5d4399aae5c70ff64","amp;dn":"Home+Cooking+with+Jean-Georges+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f43b2ce7327865f00b3f7d5d4399aae5c70ff64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,67,178,206,115,39,134,95,0,179,247,213,212,57,154,174,92,112,255,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
