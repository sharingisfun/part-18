I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.\n\nAlbums Include:\n\nL.T.D. - Togetherness\nL.T.D. - Love To The World\nL.T.D. - Shine On\nL.T.D. - Something To Love\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf91a2800329a3020a5f16e9d4d3882cdfee0533","amp;dn":"L.T.D.+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf91a2800329a3020a5f16e9d4d3882cdfee0533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,145,162,128,3,41,163,2,10,95,22,233,212,211,136,44,223,238,5,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
