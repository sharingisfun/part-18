As with the Kinks-Size album, it is made up mainly of songs not released on an equivalent UK LP. The album charted, peaking at number 47.\n\nThe album takes all four tracks from the UK Kwyet Kinks EP (including both sides of the recent hit US single &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot;), adding &quot;Naggin' Woman&quot; (left off the US version of their previous LP, Kinda Kinks), recent US singles &quot;Who'll Be the Next in Line&quot; (its B-side was already included on the US version of Kinda Kinks), &quot;See My Friends&quot;/&quot;Never Met a Girl Like You Before&quot; and B-side &quot;I Need You&quot; (A-side &quot;Set Me Free&quot; had again already been included on the US Kinda Kinks LP) as well as two older tracks. &quot;It's Alright&quot; was the B-side of breakthrough 1964 single &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; but had as yet not been included on a US LP. &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, another 1964 track, had however already been included on Kinks-Size.\n\nThis was the last US only studio album released by the Kinks. Starting with The Kink Kontroversy, Reprise issued albums identical to the UK versions.\n\nOriginal US Edition: Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot; - 2:43\n    &quot;Such a Shame&quot; - 2:19\n    &quot;Wait Till the Summer Comes Along&quot; - 2:07\n    &quot;Naggin' Woman&quot; (Anderson, West) - 2:36\n    &quot;Never Met a Girl Like You Before&quot; - 2:05\n    &quot;See My Friends&quot; - 2:46\n    &quot;Who'll Be the Next in Line&quot; - 2:02\n    &quot;Don't You Fret&quot; - 2:45\n    &quot;I Need You&quot; - 2:26\n    &quot;It's Alright&quot; - 2:37\n    &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (R.
