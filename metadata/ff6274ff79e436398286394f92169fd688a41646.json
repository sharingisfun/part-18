The film was set in the real world, while the game was set a fictional 'fantasy' world where the Commando Elite were trying to eliminate the Gorgonites and destroy their home. Most of the characters in the film were in the game, along with the addition of two new Gorgonites, Stench and Nibble. Players will earn the role as Archer, as he battled through Gorgon fighting Commandos, led by Chip Hazard.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nSingleplayer\nPlayers are equipped with a rapid-fire crossbow, which can receive new ammunition type, which has various accuracies and strengths. Players can also use turrets and battle-walkers. These are hard to be damaged and can deal serious damage on enemies. Players can also rescue fellow Gorgonites like Insaniac, who will attack nearby Commandos.\n\nMultiplayer\nIn multiplayer mode players can play as either Archer, or as Chip. The gameplay is the same as singleplayer, only without allies and enemies. For Chip his default weapon is a rapid-fire pistol, which can also receive new ammo types.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6274ff79e436398286394f92169fd688a41646","amp;dn":"Small+Soldiers+%28PSX%29+%28PS1%29+%28Action%29+%28Shooter%29+%28DeathMatch+MP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6274ff79e436398286394f92169fd688a41646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,98,116,255,121,228,54,57,130,134,57,79,146,22,159,214,136,164,22,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
