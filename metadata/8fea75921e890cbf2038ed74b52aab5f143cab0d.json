But Susan, his mother, is immobilized by a broken leg, and his father Tom, a travelling salesman, makes Raymond stay home and take care of his mother, an attractive though unhappy woman. His mother's condition leads them to a degree of immediate physical contact which Raymond finds disturbing. He soon meets Toni, a high school girl, but his sexual impulses are increasingly confused, especially since he is still upset over losing the internship.\n\nAudio Format: MPEG-1 Layer 3\nBitrate: 79kbps\nAudio Samples: 48,000Hz\nChannels: (2) Mono\nVideo Format: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 891kbps\nResolution: 624x336\nFPS: 23.98\nSource: DVD\nOriginal Format: NTSC\nIMDb Rating: 6.5/10 (1,783 votes)\nMovie Information: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111252/\nCD1 Size: 700 MB (or 717,026 KB)\nRuntime: 100 Minutes\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fea75921e890cbf2038ed74b52aab5f143cab0d","amp;dn":"Spanking.The.Monkey.1994.DVDRip.XviD-FRAGMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fea75921e890cbf2038ed74b52aab5f143cab0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,234,117,146,30,137,12,191,32,56,237,116,181,42,171,95,20,60,171,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
