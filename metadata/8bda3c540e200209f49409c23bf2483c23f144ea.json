Formerly with the Emotions and the Hippy Boys, Brown recorded sparsely during his time away from the island, though he did release one LP, Color Barrier on his own Caturna label made of songs he recorded between Canada and Jamaica and including the stunning Color Barrier and its variation Money Barrier. It is this track that became much in demand amongst roots fans in the eighties and nineties, Joey Jay being particularly fond of the tune and playing it frequently on his popular KISSFM roots reggae show during that time. This album collects all the various cuts to Color / Money Barrier including cuts originally issued only on 45.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. What A Fire\n2. Color Barrier (album version)\n3.
