It was a simplification of an earlier effort, Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, published anonymously in London in 1739ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1740. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the Treatise, which &quot;fell dead-born from the press,&quot; as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate his ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work.\n\nThe end product of his labours was the Enquiry. The Enquiry dispensed with much of the material from the Treatise, in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects. For example, Hume's views on personal identity, do not appear. However, more vital propositions, such as Hume's argument for the role of habit in a theory of knowledge, are retained.\n\nThis book has proven highly influential, both in the years that would immediately follow and today. Immanuel Kant points to it as the book which woke him from his self-described &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot;. The Enquiry is widely regarded as a classic in modern philosophical literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d21e838f18e6a13feb114672f59b9396ac6608e","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+An+Enquiry+Concerning+Human+Understanding+by+David+Hume","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d21e838f18e6a13feb114672f59b9396ac6608e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,33,232,56,241,142,106,19,254,177,20,103,47,89,185,57,106,198,96,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
