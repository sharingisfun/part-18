I've had a lot of unexpected demands placed upon me lately.  And because of that, I haven't been able to get to, organize, or torrent anything new since the 1st of July.\n\nBut please don't mistake my hiatus as a negative thing.  I've still been keeping on top of, and downloading all of the latest Christian music.  As a matter of fact, not only do I have Bundle 34 (which I'm sharing today) prepared, but I also have Bundle 35, Bundle 36, and Bundle 37 completely prepared.  And I'm currently working on Bundle 38 as we speak.  So hopefully I'll be able to find the time to torrent all of that in the near future.\n\nNow for something a little new.  There's been lots and lots of singles floating around lately.  So much so that I thought it would be a bit of a change to have this bundle comprised of mainly singles and EP's.  As a result this bundle is jam packed with more titles than I have shared in any previous bundle before today.\n\nGOSPEL: Adrian Bass, Amber Thompson, Ayo Vincent, Ebele The Flutist, Esther Adewumi, James Allen Hill Jr, Motara, The Nelons.
