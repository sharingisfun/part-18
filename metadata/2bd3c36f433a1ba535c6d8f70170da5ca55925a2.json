His last recording session took place in 1960 with Curtis Fuller's group, following a brief release from the hospital. After that, he quit playing and died in 1969 in New York.\n\n\n\nWilbur Harden with John Coltrane\n\nMainstream 1958: The East Coast Jazz Scene \n\n[Savoy MG 12127]\n\n1958\n\n\n  CD / 1992 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nWells Fargo\n\nWest 42nd Street\n\nE.F.F.P.H\n\nSnuffy\n\nRhodomagnetics\n\n\nRecorded at the Rudy Van Gelder Studio in Hackensack, NJ on March 13, 1958\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nWilbur Harden Ã¢â‚¬â€ trumpet, flugelhorn\n\nJohn Coltrane Ã¢â‚¬â€ tenor saxophone\n\nTommy Flanagan Ã¢â‚¬â€ piano\n\nDoug Watkins Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass\n\nLouis Hayes Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums\n\n\nWilbur Harden with John Coltrane \nMainstream 1958: The East Coast Jazz Scene [Savoy MG 12127]\n1958","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bd3c36f433a1ba535c6d8f70170da5ca55925a2","amp;dn":"Wilbur+Harden+%2F+John+Coltrane+-+Mainstream+1958+%5BSavoy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bd3c36f433a1ba535c6d8f70170da5ca55925a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,211,195,111,67,58,27,165,53,198,216,247,1,112,218,92,165,89,37,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
