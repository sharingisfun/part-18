It examines the ways each used fluid dynamic principles in the design of their vessels. In the process, this book covers the history of hydrodynamic (aero and fluid) theory and its progression Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with some very accessible science examples Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including seminal theories. Hydrodynamic principles in action are also explored with examples from nature and the works of man. This is a book for anyone interested in the history of technology Ã¢â‚¬â€œ specifically the methods and science behind the use of scale models and hydrodynamic principles in the marine and aeronautical designs of today.\n\nAbout the Author\nGina Hagler is a freelance writer and member of the National Association of Science Writers, and the American Society of Journalists and Authors.
