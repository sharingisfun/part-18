The story is predicated on a 200-year-old family curse. During the Napoleonic era, Elizabetta &quot;Fiorile&quot; Benedetti (Galatea Ranzi) discovers that her own brother Corado (Claudio Bigagli) is responsible for the crime for which her lover Jean (Michael Vartan) was executed. The embittered Fiorile places a curse on the Benedetti family, declaring that none of her brother&amp;#039;s direct descendants will ever achieve true happiness. Over the next two centuries, the Benedettis&amp;#039; ill-gotten wealth increases, but they lose the love and respect of their neighbors. In fact, most people prefer to call the Benedetti family the &quot;Maledettis,&quot; or the Cursed Ones. The film&amp;#039;s final episode occurs during World War II, as Grandpa Massimo Benedetti (Renato Carpentieri), the last family member directly affected by the curse, relates his tale of woe to a pair of youngsters. Will the curse die with Massimo, or will the innocent young ones be forced to carry it into the next generation? Fiorile is not the sort of movie one sits back and relaxes with, despite its leisurely pace; those willing to work with the film, however, will be amply rewarded.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Fiorile.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.45 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate : 1736 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 10.8 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate : 1539 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.913\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.246\n      StreamSize : 1.28 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate : 190 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 163 MiB\n\nItalian audio, English subtitles\n\nIMDB: tt0106911","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60a59c98a1d9b7da2f09811e474eb75d7c1d7c9e","amp;dn":"Fiorile+-+Taviani+%5B1993%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60a59c98a1d9b7da2f09811e474eb75d7c1d7c9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,165,156,152,161,217,183,218,47,9,129,30,71,78,183,93,124,29,124,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
