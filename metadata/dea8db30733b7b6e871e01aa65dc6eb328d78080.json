SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather watch reality TV than learn forty-seven ways to kill a man, and she pretty much sucks at wielding magic. Zephyr was ready for a future pretending to be a normal human instead of a half-god assassin. But all that changed when her sister was murderedÃ¢â‚¬â€and Zephyr used a forbidden dark power to save herself from the same fate.\n\nOn the run from a punishment worse than death, an unexpected reunion with a childhood friend upends ZephyrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worldÃ¢â‚¬â€and not only because her old friend has grown surprisingly, extremely hot. It seems that Zephyr might just be the Nyx, a dark goddess that is prophesied to shift the power balance: for hundreds of years the half-gods have lived in fear, and Zephyr is supposed to change that.\n\nBut how is she supposed to save everyone else when she can barely take care of herself?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dea8db30733b7b6e871e01aa65dc6eb328d78080","amp;dn":"Promise+of+Shadows+-+Justina+Ireland+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dea8db30733b7b6e871e01aa65dc6eb328d78080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,168,219,48,115,59,123,110,135,30,1,170,101,220,110,179,40,215,128,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
