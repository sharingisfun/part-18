Robinson and Jimmy Cagney; who could ask for anything more? Well, maybe a little more Cagney, as he is just a supporting player here, but overall I had no complaints watching this 1931 film.\n\nRobinson was great in the lead as &quot;Nick the Barber,&quot; (full name &quot;Nick Venizelos.&quot;) Cagney is &quot;Jack,&quot; an old friend who is employed by Nick. The Greek is a barber, but he's really a full-time gambler or evolves into that role quickly during this story. He goes from small-town hick to big city boss but the road is bumpy along the way. He gets taken by the big crook in town twice, gets hustled by a couple of blondes (Nick's real weakness) but overcomes all of them to be gambling czar.\n\nAfter Nick's successful jaunts at revenge are completed, the last third of the film is devoted to the city's district attorney trying to get some goods on Nick and put him away and get him out of his city.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb76a87fbcf5afdf58d60780605c066b6f574c1","amp;dn":"Smart+money+%28Edward+G.+Robinson%2C+James+Ganey%29+%5B1931%5D+%40%21+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb76a87fbcf5afdf58d60780605c066b6f574c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,183,106,135,251,207,90,253,245,141,96,120,6,5,192,102,182,245,116,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
