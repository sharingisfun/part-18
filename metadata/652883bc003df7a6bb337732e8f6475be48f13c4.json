This run was written by Brian Reed, and he takes Ms. Marvel all the way from just before Civil War all the way to Siege with numerous key storylines in-between. A great character study of a former Avenger trying to figure things out for herself, and smashing many things down in the process (figuratively and literally)! This torrent contains all 50 issues + the three specials which I have labeled as &quot;b&quot; numbering appropriate to where they belong. The specials are &quot;Binary&quot;, &quot;Storyteller&quot; and the 2008 Annual. All credit and thanks to the original scanners and uploaders, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:652883bc003df7a6bb337732e8f6475be48f13c4","amp;dn":"Ms.+Marvel+v2+01-50+%2B+Specials+%282006-2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"652883bc003df7a6bb337732e8f6475be48f13c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,40,131,188,0,61,247,166,187,51,119,50,232,246,71,91,228,143,19,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
