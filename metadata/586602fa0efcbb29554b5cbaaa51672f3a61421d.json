But when a gang leader makes threats against her sister Bonnie, even Rio isn't prepared for the storm that could destroy her family. When their dreams are shattered in one dangerous moment, Rio seeks refuge for them all at a peaceful horse farm in the small town of Kennison Falls, Minnesota.\n\nRio should feel safe in Kennison Falls, but her budding romance with the stable's owner, handsome British ex-pat David Pitts-Matherson, feels as dangerous as her past. The incredibly sexy David is as far from her type as any man could get, yet he tempts Rio in a way she never expected. But Rio knows that her time in Kennison Falls is limited, that her family is still in danger, and that she and David come from completely different worlds - a recipe for disaster.\n\nDavid has his own secrets, and even the sparks he feels flying with the fiery and beautiful Rio may not be enough for him to let her into his heart. Can the beauty and the Brit ever find common ground? Or will their pasts stand in the way of true love?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586602fa0efcbb29554b5cbaaa51672f3a61421d","amp;dn":"Beauty+and+the+Brit+%28Lizbeth+Selvig%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586602fa0efcbb29554b5cbaaa51672f3a61421d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,102,2,250,14,252,187,41,85,75,92,186,170,81,103,47,58,97,66,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
