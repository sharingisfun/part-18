Released in 1979, this unusual album failed to connect with Wonder's sizable following. While SECRET LIFE doesn't rank with such Wonder classics as TALKING BOOK or INNERVISIONS,it has aged rather well and features some exceptionally fine music, including the romantic hit single &quot;Send One Your Love&quot;. \nThough bizarre lyrics and sound effects occasionally dilute the impact of many of the performances, several long instrumentals like the ambient soundscape &quot;Earth's Creation&quot; and the African-flavoured &quot;Kesse Ye Lolo De Ye&quot; are some of Wonder's most adventurous and rewarding compositions. Presumably humbled by the poor response to this album, Wonder never again tried to make as bold an artistic statement as JOURNEY THROUGH THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS and he has since concentrated on the upbeat, R&amp;B-infused pop that has made him so successful for more than three decades.\n--- amazon.co.uk\n\nTracks\nDisc: 1 \n1.
