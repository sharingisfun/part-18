In keeping with the well documented love of Sci-fi that both Pegg and Frost share, each track has some link to science fiction. It is a more than diverse collection of classics from a range of genres such as Punk (\\\\\\&quot;Another Girl Another Planet\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Only Ones), Soul (\\\\\\&quot;Just The Two Of Us\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bill Withers &amp; Grover Washington Jr., \\\\\\&quot;Got To Give It Up\\\\\\&quot; - Marvin Gaye), Rock N\\\\\\' Roll (\\\\\\&quot;Flying Saucers Rock N Roll\\\\\\&quot; - Bill Lee Riley), 70\\\\\\'s Pop / Rock (\\\\\\&quot;Hello It\\\\\\'s Me\\\\\\&quot; - Todd Rundgren, \\\\\\&quot;Dancing In The Moonlight\\\\\\&quot; - King Harvest, \\\\\\&quot;All Over The World\\\\\\&quot; - Elo), Reggae (\\\\\\&quot;I Chase The Devil\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Max Romeo) and the 50\\\\\\'s Sci-Fi inspired \\\\\\&quot;Planet Clare\\\\\\&quot; by B52\\\\\\'s. Even Cantina Band\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;Syd Masters &amp; The Swing Riders\\\\\\&quot; is a rock-a-billy cover of the music playing in the bar on Tatooine in Star Wars: A New Hope ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ famously Simon Pegg\\\\\\'s favourite film. The collection also features exerts from David Arnold\\\\\\'s original score.\n\nTRACKLIST :\n\n01. David Arnold ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Paul Opening Sequence\n02.
