Dense with musical references from &quot;Louie Louie&quot; to Holst's &quot;The Planets,&quot; ABSOLUTELY FREE is a testament to the young Zappa's awesome musical breadth. \n\nThese Mothers of Invention lack the precision of Zappa's later combos, but give a firm R&amp;B grounding to his experimentation. ABSOLUTELY FREE includes the classic &quot;Brown Shoes Don't Make It,&quot; a biting parody of suburban American values, along with forgotten masterpieces like &quot;Call Any Vegetable,&quot; a tune pointing out the ease with which we can become in tune with our little green buddies.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuite No. 1: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Absolutely FreeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1st in a Series of Underground Oratorios)\n\n1.
