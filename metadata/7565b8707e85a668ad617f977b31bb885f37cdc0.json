KENNEDY \nSPECIAL WARFARE CENTER \n \n \nCACHING \nCaching is the process of hiding equipment or materials in a secure storage place with the view to future recovery for operational use.  The ultimate success of caching may well depend upon attention to detail, that is, professional competence that may seem of minor importance to the untrained eye.  Security factors, such as cover for the caching party, sterility of the items cached, and removal of even the slightest trace of the caching operations are vital.  Highly important, too, are the technical factors that govern the preservation of the items in usable condition and the recording of data essential for recovery.  Successful caching entails careful adherence to the basic principles of clandestine \noperations, as well as familiarity with the technicalities of caching. \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7565b8707e85a668ad617f977b31bb885f37cdc0","amp;dn":"TC+31-29A++Special+Forces+Caching+Techniques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7565b8707e85a668ad617f977b31bb885f37cdc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,101,184,112,126,133,166,104,173,97,127,151,123,49,187,136,95,55,205,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
