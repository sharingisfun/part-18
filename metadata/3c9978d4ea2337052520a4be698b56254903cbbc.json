Arguing that AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political leaders have paralyzed the debate on civil rights and continue to look to the past for solutions, this book challenges the nation to act with its frank discussion of one of the most pressing moral issues confronting Australia.\n\n\n\n[b] Review [/b]\n\n'An independent and fearless book which deftly negotiates a passage between the romanticism of the Left and the hard-heartedness of the Right.
