I wasn't resizing first since it cuts the uncompressed data by just over 100GB. Which to me, didn't sound good, but I think it actually does look better.\n\nSo feel free to let me know how you think it compares to my previous rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8351e7beb33d2571d4aaa874d32cdf6269647c34","amp;dn":"Bones+S05E19+HQ+HDTV+AC3+DivX+%28Re-Encode+From+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8351e7beb33d2571d4aaa874d32cdf6269647c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,81,231,190,179,61,37,113,212,170,168,116,211,44,223,98,105,100,124,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
