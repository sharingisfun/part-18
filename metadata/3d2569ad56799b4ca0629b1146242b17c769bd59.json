The group scored three\ngold singles and one platinum single including two number one pop/R&amp;B singles, &quot;Le Freak&quot; and\n&quot;Good Times&quot;; two platinum albums, C'est Chic and Risque; and one gold album, Chic. A Chic live\nrecording, Live at the Budokan, was released February 23, 1999, through Rodgers' Sumthing Distribution.\nThe bassist co-wrote and produced all of Chic's records as well as those the duo produced for Diana Ross,\nSister Sledge, and others.\n\nEdwards later produced and played in '80s supergroup Power Station (&quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;); produced ABC's\n&quot;When Smokey Sings,&quot; Ross' &quot;Telephone,&quot; and Rod Stewart; and played bass on the Rodgers-produced Madonna\nLP Like a Virgin and Jody Watley's &quot;Don't You Want Me.&quot;\n\nBy the mid-'80s, the duo was no longer producing together exclusively. Tiring of their rigorous production\nand touring schedule, Chic disbanded with Take It Off (1981, &quot;Stage Fright&quot;) and the 1982 LPs Tongue in Chic\n(&quot;Hangin'&quot;) and Believer being their last albums for Atlantic.\n\nBoth men embarked on illustrious production careers: Rodgers had hits with David Bowie\n(the number one gold single &quot;Let's Dance,&quot; &quot;China Girl&quot;), Madonna (the nine-million selling LP Like a Virgin,\nwith the number one title track single and the Top Five hits &quot;Material Girl,&quot; &quot;Angel,&quot; and &quot;Dress You Up&quot;),\nand the System (&quot;Comin' to America&quot;) while Edwards recorded with ABC, Rod Stewart, Power Station, Starpoint,\nMissing Persons, and Nona Hendryx, among others. Rodgers and Edwards reunited for a 1992 Chic LP, Chic-ism\n(&quot;Give Me the Lovin',&quot; &quot;Chic Mystique&quot;) for Warner Bros. Records.\n\nAt the age of 43, Bernard Edwards died of pneumonia while touring with Chic in Tokyo, Japan, on April 18, 1996.\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\nProduced By Nile Rodgers And Bernard Edwards\n\n01.
