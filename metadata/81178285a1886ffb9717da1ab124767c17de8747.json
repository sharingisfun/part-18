Anderson, Robin White\n2011 | 336 Pages | ISBN: 0312544553 , 0312543492 | EPUB \n\n\n\nIn 1994, Ray Anderson was 60 years old and at the top of his game as founder and CEO of Atlanta-based Interface, Inc., a modular carpet company that makes those clever carpet tiles that you may have underfoot in your office or coveted via the company's residential brand, FLOR.\n\nThat was 17 years ago - before 'green' was the compelling business imperative that it is today (for reference, oil was then $18/bbl), and frankly, the environment was nowhere on Ray's radar. An Interface associate asked Ray to give a speech to a task force that was forming to answer customer concerns about environmental impacts, and though he had not a clue what he would say, he accepted. As the date for the speech grew closer, he began to sweat -- and then Paul Hawken's book, The Ecology of Commerce, landed on his desk. The rest is green business history -- Ray read the book (he's called it a 'spear in the chest' epiphany), his outlook was radically transformed, and he gave a speech that would put the petroleum-dependent carpet company on a path to zero environmental footprint.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81178285a1886ffb9717da1ab124767c17de8747","amp;dn":"Business+Lessons+from+a+Radical+Industrialist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81178285a1886ffb9717da1ab124767c17de8747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,23,130,133,161,136,111,251,151,23,218,26,177,36,118,124,23,222,135,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
