This inspired Wood to become an editor-publisher, and he began assembling art and stories for a magazine he titled et cetera. A front cover paste-up with the et cetera logo was prepared, but when Wood learned of another magazine with a similar title, there was a last-minute title change.\n\nWood launched witzend in the summer of 1966, with a statement of 'no policy' and a desire to give his friends in the comics field a creative detour from the formulaic industry mainstream. During this same period, editor Bill Spicer and critic Richard Kyle began promoting and popularizing the terms 'graphic novel' and 'graphic story', and in 1967 Spicer changed the title of his Fantasy Illustrated to Graphic Story Magazine. Kyle, Spicer, Wood and Pearson all envisioned an explosion of graphic narratives far afield of the commercial comic book industry.\n\nMore below...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:172bd5144cf0334eff87d48d2111ee6335b65704","amp;dn":"witzend+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"172bd5144cf0334eff87d48d2111ee6335b65704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,43,213,20,76,240,51,78,255,135,212,141,33,17,238,99,53,182,87,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
