When such tales takes hold, Walker argues, they reflect the anxieties and experiences of the people who believe them, even if they say nothing true about the objects of the theories themselves.\n\nWith intensive research and a deadpan sense of humor, Jesse WalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The United States of Paranoia combines the rigor of real history with the punch of pulp fiction.\n\nThis edition includes primary-source documentation in the form of archival photographs, cartoons, and film stills selected by the author.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9c8ca885735d748f9e8d9db5da40762c57d4af","amp;dn":"The+United+States+of+Paranoia%3A+A+Conspiracy+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9c8ca885735d748f9e8d9db5da40762c57d4af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,156,140,168,133,115,93,116,143,158,141,157,181,218,64,118,44,87,212,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
