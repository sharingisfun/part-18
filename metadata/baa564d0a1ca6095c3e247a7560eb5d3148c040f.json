This release 1990 on Pablo.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nRecorded just a month after Duke Ellington's death, this tribute album (reissued on CD) features guitarist Joe Pass (just beginning to become famous), bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Bobby Durham jamming on eight Ellington tunes and &quot;Caravan&quot; (which was penned by one of Duke's key sidemen, Juan Tizol). The interplay between the three musicians is quite impressive, and Pass' mastery of the guitar is obvious (he didn't really need the other sidemen). Highlights include &quot;In a Mellow Tone,&quot; &quot;Don't Get Around Much Anymore,&quot; and &quot;I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good).&quot; Recommended. \n\n01. Satin Doll    \n02.
