Wake Up Now guides you through every stage of the journey, from the process of seeking through the often prolonged and challenging process of integrating the awakening into everyday life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18d0d627f3dcc97f974e3ea2f972b8c0eb79e2f3","amp;dn":"Wake+Up+Now%3A+A+Guide+to+the+Journey+of+Spiritual+Awakening+%5Bepub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18d0d627f3dcc97f974e3ea2f972b8c0eb79e2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,208,214,39,243,220,201,127,151,78,62,162,249,114,184,192,235,121,226,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
