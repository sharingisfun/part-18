This seems fitting, as SCAC describes their music as American (Is that not what America is and has been, a mixture of every one and thing resulting in something new?); and after more than a decade of working and living as SCAC, they have created their own genre.\n\nThe components are drums, upright bass, pedal steel, banjos, piano, guitar, vocals and stories. Spin Magazine and No Depression have described them as the best live band in America. The songs are each thoughtfully crafted with unique arrangements, executed by superb musicianship, then fully realized through original, insightful and intelligent lyrics. With 2 of the most charismatic frontmen around and 4 accomplished musicians, SCAC is the past, present and future of American music!&quot;\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/11/30/jay-munly/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85237d568534296615199949328e88782b0f2cde","amp;dn":"Slim+Cessna%5C%27s+Auto+Club...Unentitled%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85237d568534296615199949328e88782b0f2cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,35,125,86,133,52,41,102,21,25,153,73,50,142,136,120,43,15,44,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
