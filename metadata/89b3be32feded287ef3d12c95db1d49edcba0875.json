His beat was the underbelly of Los Angeles vice--full of pimps, pushers, winos, whores and killers. He lived each day his way--on the razor's edge of life. He was a damn good cop and LAPD detective. For fifteen years he prowled the streets, solved murders, took his lumps. Then, he became the hard hitting, tough talking best selling writer who tells the brutal, true stories of the men who risk their loves every time a siren screams. THE BLUE KNIGHT is a classic novel that offers the best of Wambaugh: a gritty setting, acerbic humor, and plenty of flawed but lovable characters.\n\nFor Requests &amp; to view my New Releases - \nPlease visit my Release Thread \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank You.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89b3be32feded287ef3d12c95db1d49edcba0875","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Knight+by+Joseph+Wambaugh+%28Epub%29+%7BRose88%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89b3be32feded287ef3d12c95db1d49edcba0875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,179,190,50,254,222,210,135,239,61,18,201,93,177,212,158,220,186,8,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
