Unfortunately, it does not work that way. Microsoft's Office Mobile is, after all these years, still not able to reliably open Microsoft Office files without massive data loss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all functions and formatting that it does not know, are silently stripped and thrown away. After Office Mobile touched them, many files share only a distant resemblance with what they once were.\n\n\n\n\n\n                 The only desktop-quality office suite for your Pocket PC\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter SoftMaker Office 2008 for Pocket PCs.
