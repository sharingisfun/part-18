On her second solo album she continues exploring a number of non-folk genres, though without completely leaving the acoustic-based context in which she has done most of her previous work. Guest musicians include folk-pop legends Boo Hewerdine and Eddi Reader, as well as former Battlefield Band fiddler John McCusker and flute/whistle virtuoso Michael McGoldrick. Talbot's breathy voice is perfectly suited to quiet songs of longing like &quot;If You Stay&quot; and Hewerdine's &quot;Invisible,&quot; and she long ago learned how to make sprightly trad fare like &quot;Bedlam Boys&quot; her own. What's more impressive is the way she's able to deliver a hymn of grizzled regret like &quot;Time&quot; (the Tom Waits song) with both tenderness and convincing authority. Strangely, she fails to invest &quot;Cathedrals&quot; with quite the same gravitas -- Jay Clifford sang it less prettily but more convincingly with Jump, Little Children. But her version is still plenty enjoyable, and if it's the weakest track on this album -- and arguably it is -- then that just goes to show what an impressive record this is. Very highly recommended.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/29/heidi-talbot/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/29/heidi-talbot/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99fe6c4896d33f7f97437a7ade85b2d2c01e3abc","amp;dn":"Heidi+Talbot...In+Love+and+Light%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99fe6c4896d33f7f97437a7ade85b2d2c01e3abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,254,108,72,150,211,63,127,151,67,122,122,222,133,178,210,192,30,58,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
