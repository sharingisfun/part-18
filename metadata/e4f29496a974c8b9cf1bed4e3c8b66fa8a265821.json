'La Chamade'. This is a disgracefully neglected film which manages in a not too dissimilar way to Antonioni's 'Blow Up' to show the compulsion and emptiness of living with too much leisure and wealth.\n\nDeneuve is at her most beautiful and along with 'Belle de Jour' this must be one of her more complex roles of the period. The extraordinary thing about the film is that the characters roam the bars and go to parties and chic restaurants and musical evenings seemingly oblivious to the political trauma that was happening in 1968.\n\nIf memory serves me right Sagan wrote 'La Chamade' before the events of May '68 and for all I know the film may have been completed before the month of May, but in hindsight the facts that we now know cast a long shadow over the lives of these beautiful people consumed by their own selfish desires. A small masterpiece.\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: La.chamade.1968.Alain.Cavalier.DVDrip\nFilesize.....: 700 MB (or 717,094 KB or 734,304,256 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:42:48 (147,892 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 884 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 60 kb/s, monophonic VBR \nFrame Size...: 640x384 (1.67:1) [=5:3]\nSubtitles....: English and Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f29496a974c8b9cf1bed4e3c8b66fa8a265821","amp;dn":"La+Chamade+1968+Rare+Deneuve+03+eng-spa+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f29496a974c8b9cf1bed4e3c8b66fa8a265821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,242,148,150,169,116,200,185,207,27,237,78,60,139,102,250,138,38,88,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
