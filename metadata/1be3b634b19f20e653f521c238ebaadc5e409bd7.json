He is something of an underground mercenary, hired by everyday people to fix situations that cannot be dealt with through legal means. These fix-its usually begin simply, but grow into complex problems that begin to involve more and more science-fiction and supernatural elements as the novels continue. The second novel, Legacies, is the only one that is completely free of any overtly supernatural elements.\n\n\nContents:\n# Harbingers (2006)\n# Bloodline (2007)\n# By the Sword (2008)\n\n\nRepairman Jack, Books 1 - 9  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6471943&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6471943&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nVisit us:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n--------------------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1be3b634b19f20e653f521c238ebaadc5e409bd7","amp;dn":"Repairman+Jack+Series+%5BBooks+10+-+12%5D+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+F.+Paul+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1be3b634b19f20e653f521c238ebaadc5e409bd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,227,182,52,177,159,32,230,83,245,33,194,56,235,170,220,94,64,155,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
