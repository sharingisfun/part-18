A hard-living ex-homicide cop, he's the only human ever to be allowed in the inner circle of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. And he wants to go even deeper into the vampire world-to engage in the turf war with the lessers. His heart belongs to a female vampire, Marissa, an aristocratic beauty who's way out of his league. And if he can't have her, then at least he can fight side by side with the Brothers. But fate curses him with the very thing he wants. When Butch sacrifices himself to save a civilian vampire from the slayers, he falls prey to the darkest force in the war. Left for dead, he's found by a miracle, and the Brotherhood calls on Marissa to bring him back, though even her love may not be enough to save him.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e673f93b3e6b324f62c926a2073ff920fd77776","amp;dn":"Ward_J_R_-Lover_Revealed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e673f93b3e6b324f62c926a2073ff920fd77776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,103,63,147,179,230,179,36,246,44,146,106,32,115,255,146,15,215,119,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
