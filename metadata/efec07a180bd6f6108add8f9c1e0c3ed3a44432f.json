Aberman as &quot;Mr. Lang&quot;\n\nA very stupid high school girl who needs money to attend college is recruited to model shoes and swimwear by a seedy photographer who is an agent for smut kingpin Mr. Lang. The girl is blackmailed and forced to pose for more provocative photographs. &quot;Only an alert society can rid itself of those who prey upon human weakness -- the SCUM OF THE EARTH.&quot;\n\nA classic of its kind, similar to Ed Wood's THE SINISTER URGE only much better, certainly more coherent.  Many of the same actors would appear in BLOOD FEAST, later that year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efec07a180bd6f6108add8f9c1e0c3ed3a44432f","amp;dn":"Scum+Of+The+Earth+-+H.G.+Lewis+%281963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efec07a180bd6f6108add8f9c1e0c3ed3a44432f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,236,7,161,128,189,111,97,8,173,216,249,193,224,195,237,58,68,67,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
