From the wartime jeep to the global struggle between Land Rover and Land Cruiser, the white-knuckle world of rallying and boy racers, plus James conquers Mount Fuji and races through the sun-scorched Mojave Desert to decide which is the ultimate people's 4x4.\r\n\r\nEpisode 3\r\nJames explores the wilder shores of motoring to discover what happened to the cars of the future that we were promised. From improbable steam cars and ludicrous jet turbines, he reveals how the petrol engine and the power it gave us came to dominate the 20th century. He takes to the waves in an amphibious car, risks his life at the wheel of a notorious electric scooter and takes a hair-raising trip in the fastest driverless car on earth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5e736a946773ed985c1673d5d29f198df35c9b","amp;dn":"James+Mays+Cars+of+the+People-S02--BBC-2016-720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5e736a946773ed985c1673d5d29f198df35c9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,94,115,106,148,103,115,237,152,92,22,115,213,210,159,25,141,243,92,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
