In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b793a8ff27b690267ed9e91c2d8e994c98a18bb2","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_Vhunze+moto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b793a8ff27b690267ed9e91c2d8e994c98a18bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,147,168,255,39,182,144,38,126,217,233,28,45,142,153,76,152,161,139,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
