More than three years in development and subjected to numerous industry reviews, the 85 patterns in this full-color book provide the most successful and proven design techniques to overcoming the most common and critical problems to achieving modern-day SOA. \nThe book begins by establishing SOA types that are referenced throughout the patterns and then form the basis of a final chapter that discusses the architectural impact of serviceoriented computing in general. These chapters bookend the pattern catalog to provide a clear link between SOA design patterns, the strategic goals of service-oriented computing, different SOA types, and the service-orientation design paradigm.\n\n\n\n\nPW/Password/ContraseÃƒÂ±a : comoustedyasabe2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c30d2f0b763383b172013b6c76483231fe8a32e1","amp;dn":"Thomas+Erl+-+SOA+Design+Patterns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c30d2f0b763383b172013b6c76483231fe8a32e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,13,47,11,118,51,131,177,114,1,59,108,118,72,50,49,254,138,50,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
