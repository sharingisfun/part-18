In 1971, Chomsky helped government whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg release the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret internal U.S. account of the Vietnam War. Commenting on the revelations that several Arab leaders are urging the United States to attack Iran, Chomsky says, &quot;latest polls show] Arab opinion holds that the major threat in the region is Israel, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 80 percent; the second threat is the United States, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 77 percent. Iran is listed as a threat by 10 percent,&quot; Chomsky says. &quot;This may not be reported in the newspapers, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly familiar to the Israeli and U.S. governments and the ambassadors. What this reveals is the profound hatred for democracy on the part of our political leadership.&quot;\n\n========\n\nTotal Size :  49.2MB\nTotal Length :  00:47:48\nVideo Codec : MP4\nAudio Codec : MP4a\n\n========\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:279e0a7f192b153621f3d14d30907f3f9c9e066b","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+-+2010.11.30+-+Democracy+Now+Interview+-+GCJM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"279e0a7f192b153621f3d14d30907f3f9c9e066b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,158,10,127,25,43,21,54,33,243,209,77,48,144,127,63,156,158,6,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
