King, Cab Calloway, and Count Basie all got together to record a CD. Got the picture in your mind? Well, then you probably are pretty close to knowing what Turn It On! Turn It Up! sounds like -- a big band, rock &amp; roll take on the blues. A ten-piece outfit, these guys really smoke this disc. They have created a style of music that at times feels like big band, at times old-time rock &amp; roll, and at other times straight-ahead blues. Their awesome take on Count Basie's &quot;I Left My Baby&quot; alone makes this album worth having. You'll feel like you walked right into the Cotton Club with that one. At other times they rock out, feeling at one point like Stevie Ray Vaughan playing with a big band. The sound here is hard to pin down, but great to listen to. - Review by Gary Hill, allmusic.com\n\n\n\nRoomful Of Blues - Turn It On Turn It Up\nLabel: Bullseye Blues - BB 66001\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: US\nReleased: 1995\nGenre: Blues, Jazz\nStyle: Modern Electric Blues, Jump Blues\n \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 \tBlind Love \t\n2 \tI Left My Baby \t\n3 \tTurn It On!
