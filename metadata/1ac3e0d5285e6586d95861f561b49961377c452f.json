Called Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the great voices of todayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Alexis has been compared to classic jazz singers such as Sarah Vaughan and Anita OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Day. Cole is the recipient of a Swing Journal Gold Disc award, and has won the NY Jazzmobile and Montreux Jazz Festival vocal competitions.\nThis time out, she goes further back in time with her quartet of guitarist Saul Rubin, saxophonistÃ‚Â­/clarinetist Dan Block, bassist Pat OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Leary and drummer Phil Stewart to a more genteel time when sheet music was the most common method of dissemination of popular tunes. With her relaxed style, clear articulation, unhurried, conversational approach and allÃ‚Â­knowing sense of cool, Cole and her crew strike a swinging accord on nuggets like Ã¢â‚¬Å“AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t We Got Fun,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bimini Bay,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhipÃ‚Â­poorÃ‚Â­will,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the buoyantly swinging title track and ten other tunes from yesteryear in this engaging retro revue. Everything goes down nice Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ easy on this luxurious outing, and Alexis delivers with timeless charm from track to track.\nPart of the Chesky Binaural + Series, all recorded with a single microphone, the band and singer appear right before you with this spacious, lush and multiÃ‚Â­dimensional recording. You will hear some of the most natural and pure vocals ever recorded of a jazz singer.
