More than just a broadcaster, Don is controversial, populist, politically involved, a supporter of the troops, and a figure who stirs up emotions of all kinds everywhere he goes.\n\nWrath Of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II will explore the impact Don's outspokenness has had on his Coach's Corner platform, and the attempts that have been made to curb his opinionated nature.\n\n\nTHE DATA FROM 2HD's NFO\n\n Release Name----- Wrath.of.Grapes.The.Don.Cherry.Story.2.Part.2.HDTV.XviD-2HD\n Release Date----- 03/12/2012\n Release Size----- 698Mb\n Source----------- HDTV\n Play Time-------- 01:30:11\n Resolution------- 624x352\n Frame Rate------- 23.98\n Video Bitrate---- 943kbps\n Video Codec------ XVID\n Audio -----------       48000 Hz 2ch, 127kbps\n Audio Codec------ MP3\n\n\n\nTHE PREVIOUS PARTS, FROM 2010 + 2012\n\nKeep.Your.Head.Up.Kid.The.Don.Cherry.Story.Part.1.HDTV.XviD-2HD  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5471738/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5471738/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKeep.Your.Head.Up.Kid.The.Don.Cherry.Story.Part.2.HDTV.XviD-2HD   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5473014/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5473014/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\nWrath.Of.Grapes.The.Don.Cherry.Story.2.Part.1.HDTV.XviD-2hd &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7079729/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7079729/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\n\n\n will there be a third segment to the mega-biopic of Don Cherry?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab54e3db0a87f02ca6e80e9dd4b290756efb70b","amp;dn":"Wrath.Of.Grapes.The.Don.Cherry.Story.2.Part.2.HDTV.XviD-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab54e3db0a87f02ca6e80e9dd4b290756efb70b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,181,78,61,176,168,127,2,202,110,128,233,221,75,41,7,86,239,183,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
