It was filmed by Dave Haynie, one of the original engineers behind the Amiga for his own personal use but after some alteration was launched to show an account of Commodores' failure to stay alive. It is a very enlightening piece that gives a graphic account of the frustration felt by many of those that worked there.\n\nMovie is in XViD-format with english subs as SRT files. The movie is splitted in two so you're able to burn it to CD if you like.\n\nThe videos has some slight audio sync issues but i think they're watchable anyway.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e037e54a7f3c9fcc86ff9e78662172023f6b261","amp;dn":"The.Deathbed.Vigil.1994.DVDRip.XViD-CCC+%28last+days+of+Commodore%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e037e54a7f3c9fcc86ff9e78662172023f6b261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,3,126,84,167,243,201,252,200,111,249,231,134,98,23,32,35,246,178,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
