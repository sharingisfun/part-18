Salzman&amp;#039;s amazing book New Water for a Thirsty World (1960) which is not only an excellent introduction into water science but also offers rare information into the concept of &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;new&quot; water - water which occurs naturally and contains concentrations of the primary minerals. A tremendous body of geologic and other evidence supports the theory that the waters on the surface of the earth have come from the interior of the earth throughout geologic time and that this process continues today. Outstanding and highly relevant book on the background, theory and practice of locating portable water supplies that are everlasting, through tapping of the most likely source - in rock fissures. New Water for a Thirsty World is a fantastic addition to the emerging living water technology. 205 pages, some pictures. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa9586b154ed31a75d954fead99f083cd27c5d2","amp;dn":"Salzman+-+New+Water+for+a+Thirsty+World+%28tapping+everlasting+wat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa9586b154ed31a75d954fead99f083cd27c5d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,169,88,107,21,78,211,26,117,217,84,254,173,153,240,131,205,39,197,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
