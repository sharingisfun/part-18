One of the genres that is becoming more popular is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œboys' loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ manga, also known as yaoi or shonen-ai. This collection of essays covers various aspects of these books. The quality of the selections varies; some are clear and lively; others are bogged down by the authors' apparent wish to appear erudite. Interestingly, the most accessible articles are those written by women. Boys' Love Manga is not a readers' advisory or a primer on the best examples of the genre. Its function is as a discussion of various aspects of it and would fit in public libraries with avid readers of BL, librarians with an interest in the subject, or as a resource for university-level course work. Unless a high school is very progressive and has a course in the sociological aspects of all forms of manga, its usefulness in a school library is limited.Suanne Roush, Osceola High School, Seminole, FL\n\nReview:\n\n&quot;At last, this collection pries open the last of the closet doors and allows for the analysis of the narratives of gay, transgendered, and intersexual subjects to emerge. Manga have been a unique source and archive of such work, slowly developing what has become a massive, global fan base. Each of the narratives in this anthology takes on a particular facet of the complicated and complex area of culture that surrounds the boys' love genre, moving the discussion--finally--out into the light of day.&quot; --Frenchy Lunning, editor-in-chief of Mechademia and professor, Minneapolis College of Art and Design.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d18a93e50d874825c0ce167da7621c2a27af9b","amp;dn":"Boys%5C%27+Love+Manga+-+Essays+on+the+Sexual+Ambiguity+and+Cross-Cul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d18a93e50d874825c0ce167da7621c2a27af9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,209,138,147,229,13,135,72,37,192,206,22,125,167,98,28,42,39,175,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
