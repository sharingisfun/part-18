Many of these theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by a secret society calling itself the Illuminati.[8][9] Conspiracy theorists have claimed that many notable people were or are members of the Illuminati, including Winston Churchill, the Bush family,[10] Barack Obama,[11] the Rothschild family,[12] David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski.[13] In addition to the shadowy and secret organization, several modern fraternal groups claim to be the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œheirsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the Bavarian Illuminati and have openly used the name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIlluminatiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in founding their own rites. Some, such as the multiple groups that call themselves some variation on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Illuminati OrderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½[14][15][16] use the name directly in the name of their organization, while others, such as the Ordo Templi Orientis, use the name as a grade of initiation within their organization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20d65609bf93baf3283b8949928cda4d33aa4ee0","amp;dn":"tupac+death+illuminati+conspiracies_FLV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20d65609bf93baf3283b8949928cda4d33aa4ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,214,86,9,191,147,186,243,40,59,137,73,146,140,218,77,51,170,78,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
