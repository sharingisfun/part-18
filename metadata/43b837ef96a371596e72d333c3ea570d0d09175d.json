Life before she had a relentless thirst for blood... life before she became a vampire.\n\nAll Bree knows is that living with her fellow newborns has few certainties and even fewer rules: watch your back, don't draw attention to yourself and, above all, make it home by sunrise or die. What she doesn't know: her time as an immortal is quickly running out.\n\nThen Bree finds an unexpected friend in Diego, a newborn just as curious as Bree about their mysterious creator, whom they know only as &quot;her&quot;. As they come to realize that the newborns are pawns in a game larger than anything they could have imagined, Bree and Diego must choose sides and decide whom to trust. But when everything you know about vampires is based on a lie, how do you find the truth?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43b837ef96a371596e72d333c3ea570d0d09175d","amp;dn":"Short+Second+Life+of+Bree+Tanner_+An+Eclipse+Novella%2C+The+-+Step","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43b837ef96a371596e72d333c3ea570d0d09175d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,184,55,239,150,163,113,89,110,114,211,51,195,234,87,13,13,9,23,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
