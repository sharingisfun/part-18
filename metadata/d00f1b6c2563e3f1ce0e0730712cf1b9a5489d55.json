Who better to commit crimes than guests of Her Majesty?\n\n01 Burglars Bargains - Realising that their pensions from the Prisoners' Aid Society will be very small, Charles and George recruit the B Block prisoners to raid Harridges department store. Unknown to them however, Harridges security is run by the Mafia, who have their own plans.\n\n02 A Right Royal Rip Off - The B Block team plan to steal the Crown Jewels - on the same night as the Mafia plan just the same.\n\n03 The Bigger They Are - The trio finally decide to face up to the Mafia.\n\nAll very silly, but entertaining.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00f1b6c2563e3f1ce0e0730712cf1b9a5489d55","amp;dn":"B+Block+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00f1b6c2563e3f1ce0e0730712cf1b9a5489d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,15,27,108,37,99,227,241,206,14,7,48,113,44,241,185,165,72,157,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
