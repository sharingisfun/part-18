While this JSP set isn't extravagant, it's a luxury to have Turner's sides for National, Aladdin, Freedom, MGM, and Imperial remastered and together in one collection. The final disc also includes the Boss of the Blues' first recordings for Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun of Atlantic Records: &quot;Chains of Love,&quot; &quot;Sweet Sixteen,&quot; &quot;Poor Lover's Blues,&quot; and &quot;Still in Love (With You).&quot; Turner tackles blues, swing, and fiery up-tempo jump blues, assisted by Pete Johnson, Wynonie Harris, Pee Wee Crayton, Budd Johnson, Dave Bartholomew, Fats Domino, Joe Houstin, Albert Ammons, Don Byas, Art Tatum, and Hot Lips Page. \n\n\nDisc A:\n\n1938-1941\nFeaturing: Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, Art Tatum, Hot Lips Page \n\n01.
