After starring in the Viennese production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats in 1983, two years later Lemper essayed the title role in the musical comedy Peter Pan; in 1986, she portrayed Sally Bowles in a European revival of Cabaret, winning a MoliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re award for her performance at Paris' ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢tre Mogador. Upon completing her work in an international tour paying homage to the life and repertoire of Kurt Weill, Lemper turned to film, appearing in Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_Lemper&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_Lemper&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nBetween Yesterday &amp; Tomorrow  2008\n\n\nIllusions  1992\n\n\nBerlin Cabaret Songs  1996-1997\n\n\nThe best of+bonus track with david bowie  1998\n\n\n\nPunishing Kiss  2000\n\n\n\nMp3\n\n192 kb/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a31b8f04e03c216215079101b34f49c406fc4c","amp;dn":"Ute+Lemper+%285+Albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a31b8f04e03c216215079101b34f49c406fc4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,163,27,143,4,224,60,33,98,21,7,145,1,179,79,73,196,6,252,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
