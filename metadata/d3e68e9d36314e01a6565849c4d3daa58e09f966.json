It feels like Bosch has known John Li, the owner of Fortune Liquor, forever. His murder seems at first like a senseless killing, but quickly proves more complicated, as Bosch and his team uncover connections to a local member of a Hong Kong mafia crew. So when word reaches Bosch that his daughter--who lives in Hong Kong with her mother--is missing, he doesn't miss a beat getting across the globe. He journeys deep into this unknown city, stopping at nothing to bring her to safety.\nDetails\nNarrated by:\tLen Cariou\nSeries:\tHarry Bosch\nEdition Description:\tUnabridged\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3e68e9d36314e01a6565849c4d3daa58e09f966","amp;dn":"Nine_Dragons_Michael_Connelly_UNAB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3e68e9d36314e01a6565849c4d3daa58e09f966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,230,142,157,54,49,78,1,166,86,88,73,196,211,218,165,142,9,249,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
