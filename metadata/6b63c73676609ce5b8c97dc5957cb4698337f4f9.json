Takeyama was one of a cadre of young officers who staged a coup d'ÃƒÂ©tat in February, 1936. He was not arrested when the coup failed, but as an officer of the palace guard, he knew he would be given the order to execute his friends. The night before the execution, he and his wife prepare for hara-kiri, first with passion without shyness, then in uniform and kimono with sword and dagger. Calligraphy figures in the preparation, as Reiko gathers her keepsakes to give to survivors. They embrace in death.\n\nRip specs:\n\n\n\nContainer:\tMatroska\nRuntime:\t27mn 37s\nSize:\t        744 MiB\t\nVideoCodec:\tx264\nResolution:\t688x464 ~&gt; 688x516\nAspect ratio:\t4:3\nFrame rate:\t23.976 fps\nBit rate:\t3 568 Kbps\n\t\nAudio1.0ch AC-3 @ 192 Kbps\n\n\n\nNot my rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b63c73676609ce5b8c97dc5957cb4698337f4f9","amp;dn":"Y%26ucirc%3Bkoku+aka+Patriotism+-+Yukio+Mishima+-+1966","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b63c73676609ce5b8c97dc5957cb4698337f4f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,99,199,54,118,96,156,229,184,201,125,197,149,124,180,105,131,55,244,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
