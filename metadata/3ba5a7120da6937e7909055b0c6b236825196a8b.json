The song is different from the band's usual style, with influences from American blues and country music. Eddie Van Halen recorded his guitar part on a Fender Stratocaster plugged direct into the studio mixing console. The song is one of only two Van Halen tracks featuring Sammy Hagar playing a rhythm guitar part, which he played on a Gibson acoustic. The music video for the song features the band playing against a plain white background with quick cuts to women dancing.\n\n\n\nFile Name:\n05 Finish What Ya Started - Van Halen\n\nFile Format:\nmp4\n\nDuration:\n00:04:22\n\nBit Rate:\n1597k\n\nFile Size:\n49.96 MB\n\nVideo Codec:\nh264\n\nVideo Bitrate:\n1468k\n\nVideo Size:\n720x464\n\nAspect Ratio:\n1.55:1\n\nFrame Rate:\n29.97fps\n\nAudio Codec:\nmp3\n\nAudio Bitrate:\n128k\n\nChannels:\n2\n\nSample Rate:\n48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba5a7120da6937e7909055b0c6b236825196a8b","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Finish+What+Ya+Started","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba5a7120da6937e7909055b0c6b236825196a8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,165,167,18,13,166,147,126,121,9,5,91,12,107,35,104,37,25,106,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
