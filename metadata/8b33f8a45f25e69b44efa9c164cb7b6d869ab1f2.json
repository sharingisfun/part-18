Music videos are brainwashing millions of people.  Watch my film to see for yourself.\nMy Video is on youtube: Music Videos That Still Want Your Soul\n\nThis video is fair use under 17 U.S. Code Ã‚Â§ 107 and is non-profit video.  Music Videos used were all under ten percent of the original music video.  For any music video over five minutes, less than 30 seconds was used from the source.  Please be at least 18 to watch.\n\nThis film takes an honest look at popular music videos released mostly from 2012-2013. Music videos are subversive by nature. Subversive; trying to destroy or damage something, especially an established political system. My film will attempt the argument that music videos try to destroy and damage a person morally by shaping their values and behavior. This is accomplished by the viewer not being aware of this agenda and the propaganda. Then through repetition, targeting the youth, and by creating an idol image, the target usually accepts the subversive idea. The idea is made to look fun and popular, through having many young, attractive people in music videos. My film will show countless music videos that are subversive by definition. \n\nThese are the different video resolutions.  The movie is a about 1 hour in duration\n720 version (has two audio tracks.
