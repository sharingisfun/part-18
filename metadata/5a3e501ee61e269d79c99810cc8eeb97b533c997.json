Since they are also celebrating their own 10th anniversary for their standout sixth album Viva Emptiness, the band will be performing the album in its entirety each night. To coincide with the shows and the album's 10-year anniversary, Viva Emptiness will be entirely re-mixed and re-mastered by David Castillo plus enhanced with new artwork courtesy of Travis Smith for a re-release on November 4th via Peaceville. The album will be available for pre-order from September 23rd.\n\nViva Emptiness was originally released in 2003 and is regarded by many as a classic and one of the best albums of the band. So, this will be a great opportunity to see the band play the whole album live if you are really a fanboy/girl.\n\nGuitarist and founding member Anders NystrÃƒÂ¶m comments: &quot;Sometimes after an album has been out for a while I always get the question if there's something we would have wanted to change or done differently and 99% of the time I say 'no' because we have happily moved on! But, there's been one particular album that would in fact echo with a loud 'YES' to that question. Dear friends, that would be the album you know as Viva Emptiness...&quot;\n\n&quot;This year, time is approaching Viva Emptiness with a 10-year anniversary, so is there really something to celebrate? Oh yes indeed! Our long lost mission objective will finally be completed! The album may now take that climb, in terms of audio quality, to be right up there proudly positioned beside it's younger 'album brethren' - The Great Cold Distance, Night Is The New Day and finally Dead End Kings. We will give Viva Emptiness the sound and production the songs always deserved by having our long time studio rat and collaborator David Castillo work his magic at his Ghost Ward studio. Secondly, another long time collaborator of ours, namely Travis Smith, will give the artwork an enhanced continuation of the original theme that will keep the visual aesthetes at bay! And last but not least, the crowning of the celebration: We will take Viva Emptiness with us on the road and play the album live in it's entirety while performing as 'very special guests' to our 'tragic idols' in Paradise Lost, celebrating their own 25th anniversary tour this fall.
