Until now, the millions of enthusiasts who flock to the iconic site have made do with mere speculationÃ¢â‚¬â€about StonehengeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celestial significance, human sacrifice, and even aliens and druids. One would think that the numerous research expeditions at Stonehenge had left no stone unturned. Yet, before the Stonehenge Riverside ProjectÃ¢â‚¬â€a hugely ambitious, seven-year dig by todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top archaeologistsÃ¢â‚¬â€all previous digs combined had only investigated a fraction of the monument, and many records from those earlier expeditions are either inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nStonehengeÃ¢â‚¬â€A New Understanding rewrites the story. From 2003 to 2009, author Mike Parker Pearson led the Stonehenge Riverside Project, the most comprehensive excavation ever conducted around Stonehenge. The project unearthed a wealth of fresh evidence that had gone untouched since prehistory. Parker Pearson uses that evidence to present a paradigm-shifting theory of the true significance that Stonehenge held for its buildersÃ¢â‚¬â€and mines his field notes to give you a you-are-there view of the dirt, drama, and thrilling discoveries of this history-changing archaeological dig.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9fdf4ec39f799a79b18ac66c4145d3f44c6ff63","amp;dn":"Stonehenge+-+Mike+Parker+Pearson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9fdf4ec39f799a79b18ac66c4145d3f44c6ff63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,253,244,236,57,247,153,167,155,24,172,102,196,20,93,63,68,198,255,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
