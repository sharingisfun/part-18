New advanced techniques and intelligent approaches are required more than ever to transform the Web into a universal reasoning and semantic-driven computing machine.\n The Web intelligence discipline attempts to deal with this challenge by exploits information technologies and artificial intelligence approaches to design next generation of web-empowered systems and services. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Emergent Web Intelligence: Advanced Semantic Technologies&quot; book provides valuable references and cuttingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“edge technologies for: undergraduate and postgraduate students who are studying Web Intelligence and Semantic Web courses, developers who need to design innovative approaches by applying different emergent semantic techniques to real-world problems, researchers who seek to understand the state of the art and foresee future research strategies in Web Intelligence and Semantic Web.\n The book is organized in self-contained chapters to provide greatest reading flexibility.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3adae7a7745e142006a38259633b6d66fd3247c8","amp;dn":"Emergent+Web+Intelligence%3A+Advanced+Semantic+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3adae7a7745e142006a38259633b6d66fd3247c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,218,231,167,116,94,20,32,6,163,130,89,99,59,109,102,253,50,71,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
