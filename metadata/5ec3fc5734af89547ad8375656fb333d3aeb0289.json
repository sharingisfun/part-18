Its first record in five years and its first record in fifteen years with the original band line-up, Christ Illusion is a cacophony of brutality. A soundtrack for the post-Apocalypse. Steeped in scorching riffs and a litany of menacing tracks/tirades on religion and violence, Slayer forges ahead on its devastating path of aural destruction with ten new songs, each charged with the electric hostility for which Slayer is renowned.\nOf the record Kerry King is ecstatic: &quot;I love it. I really like God Hates Us All and I think that's the best record we've done in my opinion since http://www.slayer.net/\n\nAlbum List\n[*](1983) Nocturnal Spectre (Rehearsal) [192]\n[*](1983) Satan's Children (Demo) [160]\n[*](1983) Show No Mercy [V0]\n[*](1984) Haunting the Chapel [V0]\n[*](1984) Hell Awaits (Demo) [192]\n[*](1984) Live Undead [V0]\n[*](1985) Hell Awaits [V0]\n[*](1985) Jeff Hanneman Home Recording [Various]\n[*](1985) Praise of Death (Unreleased Demo) [192]\n[*](1986) Def Jam Demo [128]\n[*](1986) Escape From The Estudios (Demo) [Various]\n[*](1986) Postmortem (CDS) [192]\n[*](1986) Reign In Blood [V0]\n[*](1986) Reign in Blood Demos [128]\n[*](1987) Criminally Insane (EP) [256]\n[*](1988) South Of Heaven [V0]\n[*](1990) Seasons in the Abyss (CDS) [V0]\n[*](1990) Seasons In The Abyss [V0]\n[*](1990) Seasons in the Abyss Promo (Bloodpack CDS) [192]\n[*](1991) Decade Of Aggression [V0]\n[*](1994) Dittohead (CDS) [192]\n[*](1994) Divine Intervention [V0]\n[*](1995) Live Intrusion (CDS) [192]\n[*](1995) Serenity in Murder (2CD UK EP) [192]\n[*](1995) Serenity In Murder (Alt.
