Another fringe benefit came by way of the SPIDERMAN soundtrack, where this Canadian quartet's &quot;Invisible Man&quot; not only appeared, but the band's guitarist Tyler Connolly was invited to team up with Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger on the mega-hit &quot;Hero.&quot; Kroeger further helped out by co-writing half of the material on Theory Of A Deadman's debut. In a quest to &quot;appeal to 16-year-old girls as well as 35-year-old guys,&quot; Connolly steeps most of his subject matter in the muck and mire of love while tending a garden of crunchy riffs and pounding rhythms.\n\nSongs like &quot;Nothing Could Come Between Us&quot; and the chugging bittersweet &quot;Point To Prove&quot; switch from devotion to devastation on a dime while the squalling &quot;What You Deserve&quot; strikes a pose of defiance in the face of a flamed-out relationship. Aside from the introspective and anti-suicide &quot;The Last Song,&quot; Theory Of A Deadman keeps it basic for fans looking for a fix between Nickelback and Creed albums.\n\nAdditional personnel includes: Brian Larson (violin); Joshua Greenlaw (viola); Charles Inkman (cello); Robin Diaz, Danny Craig (drums).\n[Source: cduniverse.com]\n\n\nOriginal Release Year: 2002\nGenre: Hard Rock\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
