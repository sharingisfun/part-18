Composed of excerpts from a 1975 date in Hamburg and a 1983 appearance in Tokyo, it provides an interesting contrast as Fitzgerald's abilities declined during the eight-year gap due to health problems. The later material is featured first, and Pass' thoughtful support props her up during the occasional rough spots. Following a series of Ellington tunes, it becomes obvious that her ability as a scat singer clearly had not diminished, as proven during an increasingly complex version of &quot;One Note Samba.&quot; They close with a delightfully swinging take of &quot;Bluesette.&quot; Pass begins the Hamburg set with a trio of unaccompanied solos, including a lush &quot;Old Folks,&quot; an intricate exploration of the bossa nova &quot;Wave,&quot; and finally, a sensational run through &quot;Cherokee&quot; that can only be adequately described as breathtaking. Fitzgerald returns to join the guitarist for a trio of Ellington songs, starting off with the lesser known ballad &quot;Take Love Easy&quot; (which was also the title track of their then-current first duo LP), along with a surprisingly brief &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; and an inspired, often humorous &quot;Satin Doll.&quot; This rewarding CD makes one wonder if there are more unreleased recording by Fitzgerald and Pass hidden in Fantasy's vaults awaiting discovery.
