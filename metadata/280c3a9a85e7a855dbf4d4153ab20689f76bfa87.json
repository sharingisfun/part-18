Since the set was released by Columbia, none of their material from the mid-'80s through the early-'90s is featured (Done With Mirrors, Permanent Vacation, and Pump). But the '70s was when this legendary band was at their most raw and rocking best, and Pandora's Box is a superb overview of the group's work from their first self-titled album up until 1982's Rock in a Hard Place. Also included is solo material from Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, as well as an early track from Steven Tyler when he fronted a band called Chain Reaction in the '60s. The hits will attract the casual admirer (&quot;Dream On,&quot; &quot;Walk This Way,&quot; &quot;Sweet Emotion,&quot; etc.), while the more obscure selections will surely please the longtime fan (&quot;Rattlesnake Shake,&quot; &quot;On the Road Again,&quot; a great demo of &quot;Movin' Out,&quot; live versions of &quot;Write Me a Letter,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Know Why,&quot; etc.). Aerosmith was always an album-oriented band, and such selections as &quot;No Surprize,&quot; &quot;Three Mile Smile,&quot; &quot;Lick and a Promise,&quot; &quot;No More No More,&quot; and &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot; often outshine the hits. By touching all the bases, Pandora's Box is an excellent package.\nAll Music Review by Greg Prato\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] When I Needed You - - - [Chain Reaction]\n[02] Make It\n[03] Movin' Out\n[04] One Way Street\n[05] On The Road Again\n[06] Mama Kin\n[07] Same Old Song And Dance\n[08] Train Kept A Rollin'\n[09] Seasons Of Wither\n[10] Write Me A Letter\n[11] Dream On\n[12] Pandora's Box\n[13] Rattlesnake Shake\n[14] Walkin' The Dog\n[15] Lord Of The Thighs\n\nPlay Time - 01h:17m:44s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Toys In The Attic\n[02] Round And Round\n[03] Krawitham\n[04] You See Me Crying\n[05] Sweet Emotion\n[06] No More No More\n[07] Walk This Way\n[08] I Wanna Know Why [Live]\n[09] Big Ten Inch Record [Live]\n[10] Rats In The Cellar\n[11] Last Child\n[12] All Your Love\n[13] Soul Saver\n[14] Nobody's Fault\n[15] Lick And A Promise\n[16] Adam's Apple [Live]\n[17] Draw The Line\n[18] Critical Mass\n\nPlay Time - 01h:12m:38s\n\nCD03 Track Listings\n\n[01] Kings And Queens [Live]\n[02] Milkcow Blues\n[03] I Live In Conneticut\n[04] Three Mile Smile\n[05] Let It Slide\n[06] Cheese Cake\n[07] Bone To Bone (Coney Island White Fish Boy)\n[08] No Surprize\n[09] Come Together\n[10] Downtown Charlie\n[11] Sharpshooter\n[12] Shit House Shuffle\n[13] South Station Blues\n[14] Riff &amp; Roll\n[15] Jailbait\n[16] Major Barbara [Alternate Version]\n[17] Chip Away The Stone [Alternate Version]\n[18] Helter Skelter\n[19] Back In The Saddle\n[20] Circle Jerk\n\nPlay Time - 01h:14m:47s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 03h:45m:11s\nTotal File Size....................... 557mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
