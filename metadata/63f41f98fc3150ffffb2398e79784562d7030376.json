Mmmh, not at all!!!\n\nUnusual, uneven, but compelling.\n\nIn Afro-Latin setting . . .\n\nThe Latin Jazz Quintet had an odd history. The short-lived group, which had quite a bit of turnover during its life, is today best-known for two sessions (one for New Jazz and a more obscure set for United Artists) in which it was joined by Eric Dolphy . . .\n\nCaribÃƒÂ© by the Latin Jazz Quintet + Eric Dolphy was recorded by Rudy Van Gelder in 1960 for Prestige under their New Jazz imprint (catalog number 8251). \nThe lineup consisted of Juan Amalbert on congas; Gene Casey on piano; bassist Bill Ellington; vibraphonist Charlie Simons; and Manny Ramos on drums and timbales. \n\nThe entire set has a laid-back feel, more Afro-Cuban than anything else, and its high point is certainly the title track, written by Casey.\n \nThe band does not drive Dolphy into using his considerable abilities, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly lazy. Instead, this is the lyrical side of the great musician, who is interested in wooing listeners rather than blowing them away. Simons' vibes work is a beautiful counterpart to DolphyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on all three instruments, but particularly on the flute.\n \n\nTHE LATIN JAZZ QUINTET + ERIC DOLPHY\n\nCaribÃƒÂ©     1960\n\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
