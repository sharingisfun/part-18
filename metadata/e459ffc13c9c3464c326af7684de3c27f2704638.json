Plus, it's just a great book. If you haven't checked this one out already you should definitely give it a chance.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is not The Complete Spacehawk, released by Fantagraphics in 2012. This is just the first part of the story.\n\n'Spacehawk'\n\nArchival Press, 1978 (this version), 64 pages\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Basil Wolverton\n\nSpacehawk is the closest thing to a colorfully-costumed, conventional action hero \nWolverton ever created, yet the strip is infused with Wolverton's quintessential weirdness: controlled, organic artwork of strangely repulsive aliens and monsters and bizarre planets, and stories of gruesome retribution that bring to mind Wolverton's peer, Fletcher Hanks. Spacehawk had no secret identity, no fixed base of operations beyond his spaceship, and no sidekicks or love interests. He had but one mission in life: to protect the innocent throughout the Solar System, and to punish the guilty. He was a dark - yet much more visually playful - counterpart to Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e459ffc13c9c3464c326af7684de3c27f2704638","amp;dn":"Basil+Wolverton+-+Spacehawk+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e459ffc13c9c3464c326af7684de3c27f2704638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,89,255,193,60,156,52,100,195,38,175,118,132,222,60,39,242,112,70,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
