In Kabylie  (French-occupied Berber territory in Algeria)  in June, 1959, idealistic Lieutenant Terrien becomes the head of a section of the French army. There he meets Sergeant Dougnac, a hard-line professional soldier. The atrocities of the war, as well as the two menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s differences, quickly put both to the test. \n\nThe actors are good, the images beautiful, the action very well done and the film shows the atrocities from both sides.  The story is gripping and visceral .  This film is an incredible commentary on the inhumanity of war.  Its simplest message is that war corrupts the human soul and that there are no winners once the shooting stops.\n\nGenre:Drama | History | War\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825248/\nIMDB Rating: 6.6/10   (594 votes)\nLanguage: French and Arabic (Good English Subtitles)\nRuntime: 111 Minutes\nThe film was released in France in 2007 and got limited viewing in the UK in 2008.

The only difference is the file type. For example, if the same folder contains &quot;my movie.avi&quot; and &quot;my movie.srt&quot; the finished or played result would be &quot;my movie&quot; with subtitles. Of course your player must be set to show subtitles when viewing in order to see them.\n\nA note about English Subtitles: \n        The problem with good English subtitles is this:\nSometimes foreign films are put up with subtitles in a set of files called IDX and SUB. These are VobSub subtitles which are a type of image file - each phrase is actually an image of the English words which is superimposed on the video picture.      Most computer players and dvd converters of .avi video do not recognize the VobSub format at all.     For .Avi video especially the preferred formant for English (or other language) subtitles is SRT. It is completely different than VobSub in that SRT is a file of (time-synced) streaming text that streams along with the video in much the same way the sound file streams along with the video file.   I have the software to do the long and complex process of converting IDX/SUB files to SRT files for subtitles. It involves OCR (optical character recognition) and re-syncing.    When I have done it for a torrent it is marked as (Good English subtitles).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e0b5aea90ccf2d243d96cc9e1c1e8bca4f9754a","amp;dn":"Intimate.Enemies.2008.DvDrip.Avi+%28Good+English+SUbtitles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e0b5aea90ccf2d243d96cc9e1c1e8bca4f9754a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,11,90,234,144,204,242,210,67,217,108,201,225,193,232,188,164,249,117,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
