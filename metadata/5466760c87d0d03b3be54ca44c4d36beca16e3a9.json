TerrorVision was made by Empire International Pictures, the production company owned by Charles Band prior to Full Moon.\n\nThe hokey TerrorVision is more an unintentional model of how horror films were made in the early '50s than a trend-setting story about the TV monster who ate them all. When Stanley (Gerrit Graham) goes outside to adjust his family's satellite dish, a living, organic alien monster-cum-garbage-disposal is zapped into the TV sets in Stanley's household. The monster pops out of the sets once in awhile to grab a quick snack of anyone within reach. Hopefully, the young boy in the family -- the only one close to normal in the house -- might have a solution to their problem\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY CLOWNSEC * HONK *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5466760c87d0d03b3be54ca44c4d36beca16e3a9","amp;dn":"TerrorVision+%281986%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+CLOWNSEC+%28PhreakyFlix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5466760c87d0d03b3be54ca44c4d36beca16e3a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,102,118,12,135,208,208,59,59,229,76,164,76,77,54,190,202,22,227,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
