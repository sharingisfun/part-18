This         \n      plugin, tightly integrated with Rhino 4, adds a suite of new       \n         surfacing tools to help designers speed up their design         \n      time, accomplish tasks that would be tedious or difficult in       \n        Rhino, and translate between subdivision surface modeling        \n                           programs and Rhino.                           \n        T-Splines 2.0 for Rhino overview from T-Splines on Vimeo.        \n                            Product benefits                             \n                                                                         \n              * Design faster: Speed up the design process and           \n           decrease your design time. Replace slow and tedious           \n         workflows with T-Splines' rapid surface creation tools.         \n            * Meet customer requirements with ease: Easily create        \n       models that meet aesthetic requirements and match customer        \n                         design specifications.                          \n            * Be more innovative: Create fluid and organic shapes        \n                that cannot be modeled with other tools.                 \n              * Be more competitive: Cycle through more design           \n       iterations in less time and respond faster to design bids.        \n            * Create production-ready designs: T-Splines surfaces        \n                are ready for analysis and manufacturing.                \n           * Eliminate rework and clean-up: Create continuous and        \n                            gap-free models.                             \n                                                                         \n            The reason I am excited about T-Splines is that its         \n       increasingly difficult to bid competitively for design jobs       \n      in the past few years as off-shore design agencies have been       \n                          driving margins down.                          \n                                                                         \n          A recent design project that would have typically been a       \n        3 to 4 hour modeling job for me took only 20 minutes with        \n         T-Splines. That means I could pump out 10 to 15 design          \n       iterations in a day, and more quickly converge on the final       \n      design with my client. With this speed I can underbid larger       \n      companies and still make the same profit I made 5 years ago.       \n                         - Dan Falvey, tools4design                      \n                                                                         \n                            Product features                             \n                                                                         \n          * New modeling technique: Polygonal or Box modeling is a       \n        method where the designer pulls on, extrudes, and scales         \n        basic shapes to quickly rough out a desired shape. As the        \n        model becomes more refined, sections of the shape can be         \n        subdivided to add more detail and control. T-Spines makes        \n         this technique available for the first time in a NURBS          \n                     compatible method.

Read more...                        \n            * High level of shape control: Keeping the number of         \n      control points to a minimum (to facilitate a smooth surface)       \n       is the first rule of modeling. T-Splines makes this easy to       \n      do, by letting you insert single control points instead of a       \n         whole row, as required in NURBS. Editing these points,          \n        deleting sections of points, and adding local creases are        \n                             possible, too.                              \n             * Interoperability: Import polygonal models or .obj         \n         files and convert them to T-Splines surfaces. T-Splines         \n      surfaces are 100 percent directionally compatible with NURBS       \n          and at any point in the design, you can convert your           \n       T-Splines model to a NURBS model for downstream analysis or       \n                      manufacturing applications.                        \n                                                                         \n                                                                      \n                                                                   \n                                        \n                       \n               R L S N F O              \n                                               \n                                                        \n                                                              \n                                                                      \n                               1. read nfo                               \n                                2. unpack                                \n                               3. install                                \n                     4. read readme and replace file                     \n                     5. thank you for choosing RedT                      \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                      \n                                                                    \n                                        \n                       \n                G i N F O               \n                                               \n                                                        \n                                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          No News At The Moment                          \n                                                                         \n                           We are not looking                            \n                                   for                                   \n                                anything                                 \n                                                                         \n                         C O N T A C T                             \n                                                              \n                    www...:                                \n                      email...:                               \n                        iRC...:                                \n                                                                 \n                                                               \n                       RedT is a Closed Group                  \n                                                               \n                                                             \n                                                            \n                                                  \n                                     \n                         \n                                   \n                                    \n                                  \n                 ascii  VN!RcA \n                          \n                                \n                                         \n                              \n                                         \n                                              \n                                    2k9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d525cdbd3761df1831fbbf94bc5f0d1d2019c444","amp;dn":"T.Splines.for.Rhino.v2.Build.20091120.Cracked-RedT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d525cdbd3761df1831fbbf94bc5f0d1d2019c444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,37,205,189,55,97,223,24,49,251,191,148,188,95,13,29,32,25,196,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
