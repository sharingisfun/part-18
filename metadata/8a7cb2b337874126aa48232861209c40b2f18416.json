A Lecture at Reed College.\nBy Howard Zinn\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\n\n\nA scintillating lecture and discussion by the legendary teacher, historian, playwright, and activist. Here Zinn explains with great humor and passion how his teaching, his history, and his activism are parts of the same project. The stories of social movementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½labor, civil rights, feminists, anti-warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are usually left out or grossly distorted in mainstream history writing. The efforts of Zinn and others to recover and pass on those stories offers to their students, to their readers, and to us, models, ideas, inspirations for how and why we might go about challenging and changing the structures of power.\n\nHoward Zinn is the author of the best-selling ''People's History Of The United States'' (over a million copies sold), and numerous other works of history, politics, and biography.\n\n\nRunning Time: 1:42:50\n\n\n1  Machiavelli And Teaching\n2  Professionalism And Morality\n3  Mumia Abu-Jamal\n4  The History Profession\n5  Objectivity\n6  Making Choices\n7  History Standards\n8  The Best And The Brightest\n9  The Mexican War\n10 The Conquest Of The Philippines\n11 Having A Point Of View\n12 The Same Old Story\n13 Un-American Activities\n14 Class Consciousness\n15 Emile Zola's 'Germinal'\n16 Class Struggle\n17 The American Revolution\n18 The Founding Fathers\n19 Corporate Welfare \n20 Class Legislation \t\n21 Labor History \t\n22 The Ludlow Massacre \t\t\n23 World War 2: 'The Good War' \n24 The Civil Rights Movement \t\n25 The Power Of The People \t\t\n26 How Social Change Happens \t\t\t\n27 Why Solidarity Matters \t\t\t\n28 The Need To Act \t\t\t\n29 Creating New Possibilities \t\t\t\n30 Strikes, Unions And Civil Disobedience \t\t\t\n31 The Unreported Resistance \t\t\t\n32 The Good Doctor\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a7cb2b337874126aa48232861209c40b2f18416","amp;dn":"Howard+Zinn+-+A+People%5C%27s+History+of+the+United+States.+A+Lectur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a7cb2b337874126aa48232861209c40b2f18416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,124,178,179,55,135,65,38,170,72,35,40,97,32,156,64,178,241,132,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
