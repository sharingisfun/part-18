The former Black Sabbath frontman has been highly criticized over his career, mostly due to rumors denouncing him as a psychopath and Satanist. Despite his reputation, no one could deny that Osbourne has had an immeasurable effect on heavy metal. While he doesn't possess a great voice, he makes up for it with his good ear and dramatic flair. As a showman, his instincts are nearly as impeccable; his live shows have been overwrought spectacles of gore and glitz that have endeared him to adolescents around the world. Indeed, Osbourne has managed to establish himself as an international superstar, capable of selling millions of records with each album and packing arenas across the globe, capturing new fans with each record.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Miracle Man\n02.Devil's Daughter (Holy War)\n03.Crazy Babies\n04.Breakin' All The Rules\n05.Bloodbath In Paradise\n06.Fire In The Sky\n07.Tattooed Dancer\n08.Demon Alcohol\n09.Hero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:699f2752a54f28d28d5f8ecb6ae65fb7cbab167f","amp;dn":"Ozzy+Osbourne+-+No+Rest+For+The+Wicked+%281995%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"699f2752a54f28d28d5f8ecb6ae65fb7cbab167f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,159,39,82,165,79,40,210,141,95,142,203,106,230,95,183,203,171,22,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
