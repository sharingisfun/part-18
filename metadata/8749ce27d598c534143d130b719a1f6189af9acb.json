Mingus is a god on his instrument and a master composer. You have one copy of this on the Bay and I question its quality, so submitted for your approval, in glorious FLAC, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. Folk Forms No. 1 (13:08)\n2. Original Faubus Fables (9:19)\n3. What Love (15:23)\n4. All The Things You Could Be By Now If Sigmund Freud's Wife Was Your Mother (8:33)\n\n(P.S. I don't care which album you thought was better or what you think of Mingus. Got a problem with the torrent? Go ahead and comment. Otherwise, piss off.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8749ce27d598c534143d130b719a1f6189af9acb","amp;dn":"Charles+Mingus+Presents+Charles+Mingus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8749ce27d598c534143d130b719a1f6189af9acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,73,206,39,213,152,197,52,20,61,19,11,113,154,31,97,137,175,154,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
