Raised in upper-class Jewish splendor, first at the Majestic Hotel and then at the Beresford, at finishing schools and fancy stables, Sandi was the wild child of the late 40Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, the 50Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, and the early 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. She was the Paris Hilton of her day, partying till dawn at El Morocco and the Stork Club, dating the biggest celebrities of the era. Her life was not without heartbreak and tragedy, including the insanity of her mother, and the crippling handicap of her baby brother Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to mention his drug addiction.\n\nSandi was privy to her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secrets as well as his unexpected tenderness. She always stuck closely to the strict code of omerta. In Daughter of the King, Sandi teams up with Nick Pileggi (author of the seminal Wise Guy, perhaps the best-selling mob book ever) and multiple time New York Times Bestselling writer Bill Stadiem. Nick has made a career in books and films chronicling the mob, and Bill has emerged as a master of recreating the glamour and romance of the golden era of American culture with bestsellers like Mr. S and George HamiltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mind if I Do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22ea53701f00672fb0520d8d607eac213bec2735","amp;dn":"Daughter+of+the+King+-+Growing+Up+in+Gangland+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22ea53701f00672fb0520d8d607eac213bec2735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,234,83,112,31,0,103,47,176,82,13,141,96,126,172,33,59,236,39,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
