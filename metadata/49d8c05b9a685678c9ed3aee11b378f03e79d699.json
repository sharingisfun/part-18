Your backups can be saved directly to external USB and FireWireÃ¢â€žÂ¢ drives, to internal or network drives, and even directly to CD, DVD, or BD. The Image for Windows package includes an easy-to-use MakeDisk wizard for creating a recovery boot disk. To restore your data, programs and operating systems back to the way they were when the backup was created, simply boot the recovery disk and restore the partition(s) or drive(s) you need to recover. It's that easy. Image for Windows utilizes the technology provided by Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) or PHYLockÃ¢â€žÂ¢, an add-on component included in the Image for Windows package. VSS and PHYLockÃ¢â€žÂ¢ allows you to continue using your computer while the backup is locked to a point-in-time. This eliminates the inconsistencies typically experienced while backing up a partition that is in use. Image for Windows runs under the Windows operating system, yet it can backup or restore any partition, including those of DOS or Linux, and even partitions encrypted by third-party software. The TeraByte drive image files produced by Image for Windows are compatible across all TeraByte Unlimited disk imaging products of the same major version number (i.e. all 1.x products are compatible with other 1.x products). This gives you the flexibility to restore disk images using your product of choice.\n\n\n[Requirements]----------------------------------\n\nCompatible with Windows x86 and Windows x64 versions.\nCompatible with Windows NT4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8.\nCompatible with Windows Server and SBS versions (NT4, 2000, 2003, 2008, 2008R2, 2011, etc..).\n\n\nProduct Official Website ::----------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.terabyteunlimited.com/image-for-windows.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.terabyteunlimited.com/image-for-windows.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMore Infomation :----\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_for_Windows_(disk_imaging)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_for_Windows_(disk_imaging)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------[Install Notes]---------------------------------\n\nRun ifw_en_trial\n\nTo Install ifw_en_trial\n\nFollow The Onscreen Instructions By The Installer\n\nWhen Finish Installing, \n\nAnd Click Finish To Complete The Setup, Now Make Sure The Program Is Not Running, \n\nDo Not Launch The App\n\nCopy Content from Crack Folder to Install Directory\n\nDone Enjoy !!! .\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49d8c05b9a685678c9ed3aee11b378f03e79d699","amp;dn":"Terabyte+Image+for+Windows+2.81+Final+with+Crack+By+Aatif741","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49d8c05b9a685678c9ed3aee11b378f03e79d699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,216,192,91,154,104,86,120,201,237,58,238,17,179,120,240,62,121,214,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
