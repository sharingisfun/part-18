To Inspector Thomas Pitt and his wife, Charlotte, this macabre apparition seems like sheer lunacy. Who would ever want to exhume a decently buried old chap like Lord Augustus Fitzroy-Hammond?\n\nA doctor insists that Lord AugustusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death was natural. But as far as the police are concerned, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly nothing natural about any of this gristly aftermath. Inspector Pitt is determined to unearth the truthÃ¢â‚¬â€œeven if the digging puts his own life at perilous risk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdb72ed179f3badb01e8ee71c93d6e8186c67c51","amp;dn":"Ann+Perry-Resurrection+Row","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdb72ed179f3badb01e8ee71c93d6e8186c67c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,183,46,209,121,243,186,219,1,232,238,113,201,61,110,129,134,198,124,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
