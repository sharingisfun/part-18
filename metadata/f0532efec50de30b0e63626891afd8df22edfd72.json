It is from 1955. Then we have the complete Savoy recordings, which were done between 1955 and 1960. The final session on this magnificent collection was recorded in 1975 and was originally issued by Savoy. More details are provided in the booklet which I have thoughtfully scanned and included in this &quot;must seed&quot; torrent which is more than qualified to be passed down through the ages, or failing that, to perhaps be discovered and appreciated by some more worthy extraterrestrial life form.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0532efec50de30b0e63626891afd8df22edfd72","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Scott+-+The+Savoy+Years+%26amp%3B+More+%281955-1975%29+3+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0532efec50de30b0e63626891afd8df22edfd72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,83,46,254,197,13,227,11,14,99,98,104,145,175,216,223,34,237,253,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
