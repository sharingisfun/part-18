Starting off with Ã¢â‚¬Å“HatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Off,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the entire band lays down a powerful bluegrass groove that immediately creates a unique, credible sound. But this is a band willing to cross boundaries, as well as define them, creating a very musical and compelling style.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Pass Me The WhiskeyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rocks out on a punchy bass line from Spencer Cain and a cracking mandolin chop on the backbeat, spurred on by LindsayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bluesy vocals. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Querida TierraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ventures into a south-of-the-border groove that shifts rhythmically and melodically in a hypnotic dance. The band even ventures off into some swing styles, such as the excellent Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tied Down To YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where they toss in a clear-toned trumpet in a Rosine-meets-New-Orleans sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s completely engaging. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leaves And PodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ trods a more pop-influenced style that would sound at home from any of the more modern progressive bluegrass bands working today. And Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wonderful You AreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ could find a place on a CD from jazz/pop vocalist Norah Jones.\n\nAll the bandmembers deserve a shout-out for their skills and creativity. Mandolinist Joshua Rilko has a strong, inventive style that draws from players such as David Grisman, Matt Flinner, and others without sounding derivative. Banjo player Keith Billik employs a dramatically melodic style that perfectly meshes with the rest of the band. Resonator guitarist Mark Lavengood manages to avoid the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flux trapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to establish his own voice on the instrument.\n\nRelease Your Shrouds showcases an exceptionally talented band with a lush, warm ensemble sound that creates layers of harmonies and intricate, dynamic arrangements to draw in and captivate the listener. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a fan of broad-based bluegrass with a strong infusion of creativity and intelligence, Lindsay Lou and the Flatbellys is a band you definitely need to check out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b166a17698fd55dbcb1438cae434e7718bead428","amp;dn":"Lindsay+Lou+%26amp%3B+The+Flatbellys+-+Release+Your+Shrouds+%5B2012%5D%5BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b166a17698fd55dbcb1438cae434e7718bead428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,102,161,118,152,253,85,219,203,20,56,202,228,52,231,113,139,234,212,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
