The game was published first for the Xbox in 2005 and the PC version followed in 2006.\n\nCall of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth combines an action-adventure game with a relatively realistic first-person shooter, as well as with elements of a stealth game. The game is based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, author of &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; and progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos, and in particular the game is a reimagining of Lovecraft's 1936 novella The Shadow over Innsmouth. Set mostly in the year 1922, the story follows Jack Walters, a mentally unstable private detective hired to investigate a missing person case in Innsmouth, a strange and mysterious town that has cut itself from the rest of the United States.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\nCPU:\tPentium III 800Mhz or better\nRAM: 256MB RAM\nVGA:\tDirectX 9.0 3D compliant Video Card with 128MB Video RAM\nDX:\tDirectX 9.0\nOS: Windows XP/2000\nHDD:\t2.0GB hard-drive space for installation.\nSound:\tSound Card (100% DirectX 8.1 Compatible)\nResolution:\tDesktop Resolution of 800X600 @ 16-bit color depth minimum\nNote: Recommended Video Cards ATI Radeon 9600 Pro ATI Radeon 9800 Pro ATI Radeon 9600 XT ATI Radeon 9700 Pro ATI Radeon X600 ATI Radeon X700 ATI Radeon X800pro nVidia GeForce 3 Series nVidia GeForce 4 Ti4200 nVidia GeForce FX5200 nVidia GeForce FX 5900 Ultra nVidia GeForce FX5700 Ultra nVidia GeForce 6800 GT nVidia GeForce 7800 GTX\n \nThis is a repack\n\nHow to install:\n-run the instaler and select the folder destination,\n-uncek direct x and visual cc instal\n-whait until is done\nNote\n-necesary hdd space for unpack 1,8Gb\n-to play the game go to your instalation folder=&gt;engine=&gt;first run the launcer and set the resolution,etc for your macine=&gt;then run cocmainwin32.exe.\n-if your descktop shortcut gives eror just delete and create a new one from the engine folder\n-if dll eror is recieved when you tri to play the game,go to instaled directory=&gt;instalers=&gt; and install directx \n\nIf you like it ,seed it\nHappy gaming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe534e0d3412ac81554d2e5a48c56400135bd93","amp;dn":"Call+of+Cthulhu+Dark+Corners+of+the+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe534e0d3412ac81554d2e5a48c56400135bd93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,229,52,224,211,65,42,200,21,84,210,229,164,140,86,64,1,53,189,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
