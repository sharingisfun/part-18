After a failed suicide, The Young Man treks across Europe in an effort to track the girlfriend who walked out on him. In Paris, he attempts to deliver a traveling child, but the boy's dad never arrives. Instead, the situation leads him to The Teen (Karine Adrover). In a New Age nod, The Young Man and The Teen make love in a chair with giant angel wings, but before their relationship can ripen, he gets a clue regarding his former girlfriend's whereabouts and takes off for Belgrade and more merry misadventures.[/quote]\n\n[img]http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc118/manelosu/vlcsnap-78531.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc118/manelosu/vlcsnap-78769.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc118/manelosu/vlcsnap-79282.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc118/manelosu/vlcsnap-79478.png[/img]\n\n------------not my rip-----------\n\n[i]File Name ...........: Rhinoceros Hunting in Budapest.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ...: 1,427,767,296 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) ...: 01:33:19 (139,980 fr)\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 720x400 (1.80:1) [=9:5]\nFPS ...................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1919 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.266\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 113 kb/s (56/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1 [/i]\n\n********************************\n\n[quote]Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
