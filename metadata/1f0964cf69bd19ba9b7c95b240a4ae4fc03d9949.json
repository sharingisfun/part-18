In today 's world, cruelty and exploitation of other beings human and nonhuman alike are accepted, practiced, and profited from by most every institution of society from commerce and science to education and entertainment. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Homo sapiens are either unaware of the cruelty or accept it as unavoidable and even normal.&quot; ~Michael Klaper\n\n&quot;Our task must be to free ourselves...by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature and its beauty.&quot; ~Albert Einstein\n\n&quot;To the greatest extent possible, I try to make choices that involve the least amount of cruelty and environmental damage. I'm interested in sustainable agriculture, environmental issues, human rights, and my interconnectedness in the web of life. It is a great pleasure for me to find products and practices that have a positive effect on living beings and the environment, rather than a negative one.&quot; ~Vesanto Melina\n\n&quot;I know that it is a hopeless undertaking to debate about fundamental value judgements. For instance, if someone approves, as a goal, the extirpation of the human race from the earth, one cannot refute such a viewpoint on rational grounds. But if there is agreement on certain goals and values, one can argue rationally about the means by which these objectives may be obtained.&quot; ~Albert Einstein","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0964cf69bd19ba9b7c95b240a4ae4fc03d9949","amp;dn":"VeganOutreach+-+Why+Vegan%3F+and+more+PDFs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f0964cf69bd19ba9b7c95b240a4ae4fc03d9949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,9,100,207,105,189,25,186,155,124,149,178,64,164,174,79,192,61,153,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
