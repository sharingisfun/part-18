Keb' Mo' pushes into new directions, trying to incorporate some of the sensibilites of the slacker revolution without losing touch of the tradition that makes the blues the breathing, vital art form it is. His attempts aren't always successful, but his gutsy guitar playing and impassioned vocals, as well as his surprisingly accomplished songwriting, make Keb' Mo' a debut to cherish.(AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\nA1 - Every Morning\nA2 - Tell Everybody I Know\nA3 - Love Blues\nA4 - Victims of Comfort\nA5 - Angelina\nA6 - Anybody Seen My Girl_\nA7 - She Just Wants to Dance\nB1 - Am I Wrong_\nB2 - Come on in My Kitchen\nB3 - Dirty, Low Down and Bad\nB4 - Don't Try to Explain\nB5 - Kindhearted Woman Blues\nB6 - City Boy\n\nPersonnel:\nKeb' Mo' - vocals, guitars, harmonica, banjo\nTommy Eyre - keyboards\nJames &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson - bass\nLaval Belle - drums\nQuentin Dennard - drums on &quot;Angelina&quot;\nTony Draunagel - percussion on &quot;Come On in My Kitchen&quot;\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae657ec1c85b1660df7a503c58754ed9e402ed31","amp;dn":"Keb%27+Mo%27+-+1994+-+Keb%27+Mo%27+%28vinyl+24+96%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae657ec1c85b1660df7a503c58754ed9e402ed31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,101,126,193,200,91,22,96,223,122,80,60,88,117,78,217,228,2,237,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
