Here MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals and guitar work are sure and emotionally effective, and her personality retains a bubbliness and youthful sincerity that contrasts with the sometimes dour tone of her songs. For fans curious about Joni MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early days as a musician, Live at the Second Fret 1966 reveals the talent was clearly there long before she was embraced by the mass audience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f95299e221ad3040eafd24df36de8e4346ee5a11","amp;dn":"Joni+Mitchell+-+Live+at+the+Second+Fret+1966+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f95299e221ad3040eafd24df36de8e4346ee5a11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,82,153,226,33,173,48,64,234,253,36,223,54,222,142,67,70,238,90,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
