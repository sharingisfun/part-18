In Sin City's Old Town, the prostitutes run the show. &quot;The cops stay out. That leaves the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out.&quot; Sounds like an OK place, right? It is until a pushy, loud-mouthed guy who has had one too many drinks comes into Old Town and gets himself killed by the ladies. When they find out who he is, they realize that &quot;it'll be war. The streets will run red with blood. Women's blood.&quot;\n\nBook Description\nCriminals have always called the shots in Sin City, whether bootleggers, gamblers, or politicians. But ever since the first dame set up shop in Old Town, those side-streets have been run by the women who walk the night. It's been a delicate truce, but now there's a messy body and the mob's looking to reclaim those licentious streets. They're going to have to put down a tight band of dangerous women and a guy named Dwight to do it. Now Dwight, he knows something that the mob's gotta learn the hard way: sometimes standing up for your friends means killing a whole lot of people...\n\nthanks to original scanners and uploaders.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bccf69b72779055611ac6bdac78060fbadd55b8e","amp;dn":"Sin+City-+The+Big+Fat+Kill+%28Book3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bccf69b72779055611ac6bdac78060fbadd55b8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,207,105,183,39,121,5,86,17,172,107,218,199,128,96,251,173,213,91,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
