It also gives insight into scale-up problems and limitations. In addition, the book discusses mathematical modeling of the various processes involved in biohydrogen production and the software required to model the processes. The book summarizes research advances that have been made in this field and discusses bottlenecks of the various processes, which presently limit the commercialization of this technology.\n\nThe authors also focus on the process economy, policy, and environmental impact of this technology, since the future of biohydrogen production depends not only on research advances, but also on economic considerations (the cost of fossil fuels), social espousal, and the development of H2 energy systems. The book describes the fundamentals of this technology interwoven with more advanced research findings. Further reading is suggested at the end of each chapter.\n\nSince the beauty of any innovation is its applicability, socioeconomic impact, and cost energy analysis, the book examines each of these points to give you a holistic picture of this technology. Illustrative diagrams, flow charts, and comprehensive tables detailing the scientific advancements provide an opportunity to understand the process comprehensively and meticulously. Written in a lucid style, the book supplies a complete knowledge bank about biohydrogen production processes.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;The book includes the research activities of the different research groups involved in biohydrogen research. So, it will be very much useful for the research scientists, academicians, process engineers, etc.&quot;\n--Dr. S. Venkata Mohan, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad\n\n&quot;... a very comprehensive review of what is known about biological hydrogen production, including technological and economical issues that are usually neglected in other books on the same topic. ... The comprehensive approach used by the authors gives the opportunity to the newcomers to enter in the field with a complete picture of the topic but also researchers experienced in one of the fields of biological hydrogen production will find useful information on the other important issues of this subject.&quot;\n--Roberto De Philippis, University of Florence, Department of Agrifood Production and Environmental Sciences, Florence, Italy\n\n&quot;... an excellent contemporary review of the biohydrogen production research field. Every important aspects of this technology, e.g. the biology, engineering and environmental impacts are discussed. The book can be recommended for students, teachers and researchers.&quot;\n--Nils-KÃƒÂ¥re Birkeland, Department of Biology, University of Bergen, Norway\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
