The swimmer and diver Lucard is interested in attractive Martin. The film follows the characters' coming out with all its difficulties, the bitter-sweet pleasures of first love and the dreadful moment when one comes down to reality and realizes that one's beloved friend has a hard way to go yet. The positive message the film tries to transmit is the somewhat common motto &quot;Live each day of your life as if it were your last.&quot; Written by Guy33134 \n\nembedded english subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b87340c5ef9c958012bf053d4b1e1cf3ed84e36","amp;dn":"L%27homme+que+j%27aime+%28The+Man+I+Love%29+1997.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b87340c5ef9c958012bf053d4b1e1cf3ed84e36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,135,52,12,94,249,201,88,1,43,240,83,212,177,225,207,62,216,78,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
