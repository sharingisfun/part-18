Inspired by the paintings of the day, he tells the story of Victorian power. Railways, factories and military might made Britain the richest country in the world. Paxman finds British generals dressed in togas in the Foreign Office, meets the horse that led the Charge of the Light Brigade, drives a steam train and visits a fort, a steelworks and a millionaire's mansion to tell the story of the time when Britain seemed to be having it all.\n\nTechnical Specs for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.73GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd0893f74b476cf4d15db5cefe475d848bbd667b","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Victorians+3of4+Having+It+All+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd0893f74b476cf4d15db5cefe475d848bbd667b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,8,147,247,75,71,108,244,209,93,181,206,254,71,93,132,139,189,102,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
