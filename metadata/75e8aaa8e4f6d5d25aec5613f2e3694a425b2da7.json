Just after being sent to the Russian Front, Hermann is reported missing and, although Maria believes he is still alive, her brother-in-law, just returned from a POW camp in Russia, confirms Hermann&amp;#039;s death. Alone, Maria uses her beauty and ambition to prosper in Germany&amp;#039;s economic miracle of the 1950&amp;#039;s. \n\nThe Marriage of Maria Braun is a heartbreaking study of a woman picking herself up from the ruins of her own life, as well as a pointed metaphorical attack on a society determined to forget its past.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75e8aaa8e4f6d5d25aec5613f2e3694a425b2da7","amp;dn":"FASSBINDER_THE_MARRIAGE_OF_MARIA_BRAUN_DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75e8aaa8e4f6d5d25aec5613f2e3694a425b2da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,232,170,168,228,246,213,210,90,236,86,19,242,227,105,74,66,91,45,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
