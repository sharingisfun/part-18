But as she develops her talents and devotes herself to the life of an artist, she must consider the cost of the creative path she follows. Willa CatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classic novel is full of the breathtaking beauty of the American frontier and the spirit of the people who live there.\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nSet in the 1890s in Moonstone, a fictional place located in Colorado, The Song of the Lark is the self-portrait of an artist in the making. The story revolves around an ambitious young heroine, Thea Kronborg, who leaves her hometown to go to the big city to fulfill her dream of becoming a famous opera star.\n\nThe novel captures Thea's independent-mindedness, her strong work ethic, and her ascent to her highest achievement. At each step along the way, her realization of the mediocrity of her peers propels her to greater levels of accomplishment, but in the course of her ascent she must discard those relationships which no longer serve her.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a88c59a8c06f253cf5ab780ebbc47a8dcebe84b7","amp;dn":"THE+SONG+OF+THE+LARK+-+Willa+Cather.+Barbara+Caruso+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a88c59a8c06f253cf5ab780ebbc47a8dcebe84b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,140,89,168,192,111,37,60,245,171,120,14,187,196,122,141,206,190,132,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
