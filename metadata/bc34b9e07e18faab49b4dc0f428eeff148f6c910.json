It contains 5 sections:\n 1) Introduction\n 2) Interference\n 3) Applications of interference\n 4) Babinet's and Huygens' principles\n 5) Diffraction\nAt the end it has a summary, followed by a list of problems.\n\nHere's a relevant passage from the introduction section:\n  &quot;Geometrical optics works when the relevant dimensions of the objects\n  that interact with light (lenses, mirrors, stops, etc.)\n  are much larger than lightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wavelength (about 1/2000 mm).\n  To see wave phenomena, then, we must let light interact with tiny objects.\n  Fortunately, the sizes needed are often not as small as the wavelength itself,\n  but may be as big as a fraction of a millimeter.\n  Indeed, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see that using just your hands you can Ã¢â‚¬Å“squeezeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a light beam\n  to a sufÃ¯Â¬ï¿½ciently narrow width so it reveals its wave nature!&quot;\n\nI will provide the other chapter I scanned (Ch.14 - Holography) as a separate torrent. I'll put the link in the comments.\n\nBelow is the process and tools I used to make this &quot;e-bookchapter&quot;;\nthis might be useful for others wanting to scan books for digital consumption.\nAll the tools I used are free and open source software\nand can be found in the standard repositories of Ubuntu.\n\nStep 1. Scanned the pages using simple-scan\nStep 2. Processed using scantailor\nStep 3. Cleaned up using gimp (removal of speckles, levels correction, removal of &quot;shadows&quot; from text and images the back of the pages, damage repair, and as a bonus, fix a typo: aranged --&gt; arranged @ p.322)\nStep 4. Merged the pages using imagemagick (&quot;convert&quot; command)\nStep 5. Renumbered the pages using pdflatex, see http://askubuntu.com/a/34269\nStep 6. Added metadata and bookmarks (table of contents) manually, using pdfmod\n\nNote: I tried to perform OCR so the text would be searchable and selectable, but the results were quite bad and I decided to use only the raw images instead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc34b9e07e18faab49b4dc0f428eeff148f6c910","amp;dn":"Seeing+the+Light+-+Chapter+12+%28Wave+Optics%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc34b9e07e18faab49b4dc0f428eeff148f6c910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,52,185,224,126,24,250,171,73,180,220,15,66,142,239,241,72,246,201,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
