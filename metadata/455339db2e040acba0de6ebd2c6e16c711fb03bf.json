This is also an opportunity to lend a more modern approach to the adventure: it will be faster-paced and streamlined, with all unnecessary detail rooted out. The silly stuff is out too: the DJ is completely cut and Davros no longer makes the stupid decision of luring the Doctor into Nekros. No more Doctor tombstone.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455339db2e040acba0de6ebd2c6e16c711fb03bf","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+Revelation+of+the+Daleks+Fan+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455339db2e040acba0de6ebd2c6e16c711fb03bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,83,57,219,46,4,10,203,160,222,110,189,44,110,22,199,17,251,3,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
