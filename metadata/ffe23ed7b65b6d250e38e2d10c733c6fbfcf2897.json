It provides an extensive set of features, but is a very small and lightweight application (the installer is less than 1 megabyte, and includes many effects and a sample project). REAPER supports ASIO, Kernel Streaming, WaveOut, and DirectSound for playback and recording. It reads WAV, OGG, and MP3 files, and records WAV files. You can arrange any number of items in any number of tracks and use audio processing plug-ins (DirectX and Jesusonic). REAPER also supports volume, pan controls and envelopes per track, multi-layer undo/redo, and user creatable color themes.\n\n\nFeature Highlights\n\nFast, Powerful Editing\n\nDrag and drop to import, arrange, and render\nFreely mix audio, MIDI, video, still image media on any track\nEasily move, split, glue, resize, trim, loop, time stretch, pitch shift, fade, crossfade, slip, snap to grid, without switching tools\nIntuitive zoom, scroll, scrub, jog, tab to audio transient, MIDI navigation\nSimple and powerful nested folder system allows group editing, routing, bussing, all in one step\nFull automation recording, playback, and editing support for track controls and plug-ins\nEasily manage tempo, time signature, and varispeed changes\nSeparate audio or MIDI into freely arrangeable takes and lanes for easy comping\nEasily copy or move regions, to quickly try out alternate arrangements\n\n\nPlug-in Support\n\nInsert almost any third-party audio or MIDI plug-in: VST, VSTi, DX, DXi, AU (OSX only), JS\nNative bridging and firewalling: run Win32 plug-ins in REAPER x64, maximize RAM utilization, protect against plug-in crashes\nReWire (audio and MIDI) any capable application for even more flexibility\nFully automatic plug-in delay compensation (PDC)\nSidechain any plug-in, even if the plug-in does not natively support sidechaining\nApply FX in real time, or non-destructively render FX output\nReal-time network FX processing: use other local machines as an FX farm\n\n\n\n\nv5.0rc13 - August 5 2015\n\n+ MIDI clock: timing improvements\n# Prefs: update track panels when changing group indicator modes\n\n\n\nOperating Systems\n\nWindows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8\n\nHardware Interfaces\n\nASIO\nCore Audio\nWDM Kernel Streaming\nWaveOut\nDirectSound\nWASAPI\n\n\nSupports almost any audio or MIDI sound card or interface.\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\nUnpack and Install\n\nDont run yet\n\nUnpack keygen/patch you might have to ad an exception on your AV/AM\n\nRun patch put the name you want and leave 32bit option\n\nClick on patch box wend it's done click on register","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe23ed7b65b6d250e38e2d10c733c6fbfcf2897","amp;dn":"Cockos+REAPER+v.5.0+RC13+x86+Incl.Keygen+and+Patch-BRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe23ed7b65b6d250e38e2d10c733c6fbfcf2897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,226,62,215,182,91,109,37,14,56,226,209,12,115,60,111,191,207,40,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
