They were one of the most\nsuccessful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven &quot;Second British Invasion&quot;\nof the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK\nSingles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100, and according to the Sunday Mercury,\nthey have sold more than 100 million records.\n\nWhile they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene along with bands such as\nSpandau Ballet when they first emerged, the band later shed this image. The band worked with\nfashion designers to build a sharp and elegant image that earned them the nickname\n&quot;the prettiest boys in rock.&quot; The band has won a number of awards throughout their career\nincluding two Grammy Awards, two Brit AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€receiving the award for Outstanding Contribution\nto Music, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and were awarded a star on the\nHollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllmusic.com Review\n\nDespite the fact that Seven and the Ragged Tiger couldn't match the unrestrained pop/rock\nebullience of 1982's Rio, Duran Duran put three of the album's singles in the Top Ten,\ntaking it to number one in the U.K. Even though &quot;The Reflex&quot; gave the band their first\nnumber one hit, there's an overabundance of fancy glitz and dancefloor flamboyancy running\nthrough it, unlike &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot;'s straight-ahead appeal or &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;'s\nmysterious, almost taboo flair.\n\nIt's apparent that Seven and the Ragged Tiger's content has the band moving ever so slightly\ninto a danceclub arena, with the songs leaning more toward their ability to produce a sexier\nsound through electronics and instrumentation than through a firm lyrical and musical partnership.\nEven the unreleased tracks trade Duran Duran's handsome edginess for a shinier sound, heard mainly\non &quot;I Take the Dice&quot; and &quot;Cracks in the Pavement.&quot; It's here that Lebon and Taylor's personalities\nbegins to get overshadowed by the demand to produce a more synth-snazzy and fashionable style of music.\n\nAlthough they may have turned their songwriting down a notch in order to succumb to the\npabulum of synthesized pop, they didn't relinquish every aspect of their genius,\nand when they do deliver, it's bright, energetic, and effectual. Duran Duran's new\ndirection eventually gave Seven and the Ragged Tiger double platinum status.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n1. The Reflex [05:29]\n2. New Moon On Monday [04:15]\n3.
