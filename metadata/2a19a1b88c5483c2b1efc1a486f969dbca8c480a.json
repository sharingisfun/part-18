GUITAR offers an in-depth sampling of Link Wray's vintage '50s and '60s work and comes with a free Link Wray guitar pick.Includes liner notes by Billy Miller.Personnel: Link Wray (guitar).Liner Note Author: Billy Miller.One of the definitive Link Wray anthologies, and certainly the best one that focuses on his classic 1962-'66 tenure at Philadelphia's Swan Records, the two-disc set MR. GUITAR is an out and out monster. Lovingly compiled from the original master tapes and containing no overlap with Norton's other Link Wray reissues, the four-volume MISSING LINKS set, MR. GUITAR features 63 classic instrumentals, 26 of which have never before been released in the US. Among the rarities are B-sides, alternate takes, unissued tracks and the entirety of the previously vinyl-only SWAN DEMOS album released by the UK Hangman imprint. As fascinating as those are, the meat of this package is the classic single sides like &quot;Jack the Ripper,&quot; &quot;Run Chicken Run,&quot; &quot;Ace of Spades,&quot; and of course &quot;Rumble&quot; (note: this is not the original 1958 hit, but an excellent re-recording from 1964). The set also includes an excellent and informative 28-page booklet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a19a1b88c5483c2b1efc1a486f969dbca8c480a","amp;dn":"Link+Wray+%26amp%3B+His+Ray+Men+-+Mr.+Guitar+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a19a1b88c5483c2b1efc1a486f969dbca8c480a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,25,161,184,140,84,131,194,177,239,193,164,134,249,105,219,202,140,72,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
