I will continue with this series as long as there's interest out there as there are still many records that can fit in to this series. Records from the bands that deserve recognition though 3 decades late! \n\nBy the way a big thank you to my buddy retroaddict for ripping Secret Steps LP! \n\n\nso let's see what have we got here.....\n\n\n3-D - 3-D [1980]\n\n\nSecret Steps - Confidential [1985]\n\n\nThe Individuals - Fields [1982]\n\n\nThe Riptides - Riptides [1983]\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e41ff30a71d6d9657d0b7388c87f48df9dccdadf","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+97%5D+New+Wave%2C+Power-Pop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e41ff30a71d6d9657d0b7388c87f48df9dccdadf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,31,243,10,113,214,217,101,125,11,115,136,200,127,72,223,157,204,218,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
