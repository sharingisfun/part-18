At a time when punk and new wave were making technique for its own sake seem irrelevant, and metal was taking the guitar solo in noisier and unpredictable directions, Knopfler's clean but dexterous picking proved there was still room for traditionalism and chops in mainstream rock &amp; roll. But even without considering Dire Straits, Knopfler has accumulated an impressive rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ© as a producer, sideman, songwriter, and film composer, working alongside some of the best and best-known figures in the music business. \n\n\nGenre................: Soundtrack\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Vertigo\nIncluded.............: Covers, Audiochecker, Log, Cue\n\n\n\n01.Irish Boy\n02.Irish Love\n03.Father And Son\n04.Potato Picking\n05.The Long Road\n06.A Love Idea\n07.Victims\n08.Finale: Last Exit To Brooklyn\n09.Once Upon A Time...Storybook Love\n10.Morning Ride\n11.The Friends' Song\n12.Guide My Sword\n13.A Happy Ending\n14.Wild Theme\n15.Boomtown (Variation Louis' Favourite)\n16.The Mist Covered Mountains\n17.Smooching\n18.Going Home: Theme Of The Local Hero\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e7869c8daca90d768de06da51fdc301ae7cf30e","amp;dn":"Mark+Knopfler+-+Screenplaying+%281993%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e7869c8daca90d768de06da51fdc301ae7cf30e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,120,105,200,218,202,144,215,104,222,6,218,81,253,195,1,174,124,243,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
