After years of \ncolonial exploitation by the Ocena Community Union, the country has been left to rot. Now three soldiers stationed in Alordesh and pilots of the giant fighting\nmachines called wanzers, are about to become caught up in a conflict beyond their\nimagination.\n\nThe player assumes the role of an OCU Wanzer squad in 22nd century Aroldesh. One night while on routine patrol, the OCU base is infiltrated and attacked. Civil war is now loosed upon the nation of Aroldesh as a coup d'etat is staged. \n\nFront Mission 2 is the first 3D title in the strategy/RPG series and the first to hit the Playstation. An isometric view is used to navigate your Wanzers (mech) on the battlefield. When the player engages an enemy the view switches to a 3rd-person perspective which shows the results of the battle. Between missions you can upgrade your Wanzer and talk with NPCs who will move the story forward. The game features over 30 missions and dozens of skills and weapons to outfit your crew with. \n\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120% (Included).\n\n\nSet DataType to Playstation (Write Method Raw/Dao) and burn at 8x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Tayio Yuden CD-R Media for best quality, or if other media isn't\nworking.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know post a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed This When your done.\n\n(I Can't seed 24/7 do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2781e6d05cc50319656667db5d252267f1e53cf","amp;dn":"%5BPSX%5D+Front+Mission+2+%5BNTSC-J%5D+%28English+Patched%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2781e6d05cc50319656667db5d252267f1e53cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,120,30,109,5,204,80,49,150,86,102,125,181,210,82,38,127,30,83,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
