Imagine. Thanks to\nGMAÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s 2009 Dove Award nomination, thousands of people did. And, frankly, many\nliked the way it sounded. So what if Fireflight was a modern rock act nominated\nalongside six of Christian musicÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s biggest giants? The future had arrived. Now,\nwith the release of the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s double-taker of an album, For Those Who Wait,\nitÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s time for everyone else to catch up.\n\nGranted, the past few years have been a whirlwind. Back when the Floridians\nlaunched their Flicker Records debut, The Healing of Harms, in 2006, the\nversatile quintet rocked two No. 1 radio singles, toured relentlessly, and, best\nof all, discovered a growing fanbase that reciprocated the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s passion. Next\nup, FireflightÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s 2008 sophomore album, Unbreakable. Before the record released,\nNBC repeatedly used its title track, the lead single, for prime time television\npromos. The fuse had been lit. As operation Google ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´UnbreakableÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ began, the\nalbum debuted at No. 10 on BillboardÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s Heatseekers chart. One domino tipped\nanother. Fireflight won Taco BellÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s fan-voted ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Best of the BeatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ contest and\nthen performed at ESPNÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Winter X Games 13.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ As Fireflight logged additional\naudio exposure on ABC, E! EntertainmentÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Style Network,ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  and even SyFy,\nChristian rock and pop radio fanned its own flames, sending three more\nFireflight singles ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Unbreakable,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´The HungerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Stand UpÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» to No. 1.\nBefore the smoke cleared, the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´UnbreakableÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ music video logged more than a\nmillion plays onand the song itself had been confirmed as a future\ndownload for the wildly popular Rock BandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œ video game.\n\nThe table has been set for the highly-anticipated third project, For Those Who\nWait. With its stunning new 10-song collection, Fireflight exceeds expectations.\nAs drummer Phee Shorb puts it, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´For Those Who Wait sounds as good as IÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve always\nhoped we could sound.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\nFront and center? One Dawn Michele. With all due respect to exceptional peers\nsuch as Paramore and Evanescence, not all female lead singers are created equal.\nArmed with an arresting voice thatÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s drawn comparisons to Joan Jett and The\nPretendersÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  Chrissy Hynde, Dawn actually makes authoritative gut-rock sound\nbeautiful. And her bandmates? With her every step of the way and, at times,\nelevating the proceedings. From the moment FireflightÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s new album hits speakers,\none thingÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s for sure: This is 2010.\n\nWhile some might speculate the band had a huge recording budget or tapped the\ntalents of an iconic mainstream producer, Fireflight guitarist/support vocalist\nJustin Cox explains the recordÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s fuller, more muscular sound is the result of\ntaking a different approach and different equipment into the studio. When the\nrock quintet ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» which also features Fireflight founder/guitarist Glenn Drennen\nand bassist Wendy Drennen (his wife) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» reunited with Rob Hawkins (Jackson\nWaters, Rush of Fools), who also helmed Unbreakable, Justin told the producer he\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´wanted this album to be way heavier and way bigger.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ For much of the recording,\nFireflight also switched to high end solid body electric guitars that yield\nricher tones, and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» much to the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s credit ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» a superior amplifier known for\nunforgiving clarity if you make mistakes. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´The results were phenomenal,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ says\nJustin with a satisfied smile. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´It wasnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t about being as heavy as we could be,\nit was more about impact and dynamics. Because the soft parts, you just need\nthose to sit back. We wanted this album to sound more epic, to sound like a\njourney from start to finish.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\nAn epic journey? In more ways than one. In fact, FireflightÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s first three albums\nhave been a thematic travelogue of sorts. While the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s debut emphasized\nresiliency amidst hardship, Unbreakable focused on emerging victorious beyond\nsuch difficulty. And For Those Who Wait? ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´This album is a maturation in\nunderstanding that sometimes you donÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t appreciate why youÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â re on the path that\nyouÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â re are,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ Dawn explains. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´A lot of times, we get bogged down thinking about\nthings that weÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â re waiting for. As soon as I get my bills paid, then things are\ngoing to be great. As soon as my family memberÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s not sick anymore, then things\nare going to be a lot better. And when we do that, we totally miss out on whatÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s\nhappening in-between now and our goal. God has times of waiting in our lives\nbecause He has something for us to learn. Hard things that happen, that throw us\noff of our plan, become the most important things in our lives because God will\ntake them and use them to shape our character and who we are.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\nThis insight not only drives the albumÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s dynamic title track ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» a defiant rocker\nwhich shatters the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´UnbreakableÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ mold ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» it frames the entire record. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´This album\nis filled with even more personal stories of our own, our familiesÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â , friendsÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ,\nand our fansÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ relates Dawn, who, along with Justin, writes the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s lyrics.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ItÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s our lives, our hearts, and our pain just poured out. We worked to take the\nthings that we struggled through and faced to leave a trail of bread crumbs, in\nhopes that other people would be able to see what we went through and find hope\nin that.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\nWith this in mind, Fireflight renders lead single, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Desperate.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ Performed with\nhard-rocking urgency and emotion, the song takes you to the end of the rope and\nliterally demands the only hope there is. For Those Who Wait unveils the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s\nthickest groove yet with the song, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Fire in My Eyes.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ The instant its steroidic\nguitars kick in, the operative word is big. And just when you think itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s reached\nits height, DawnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s soaring chorus shows you how exquisite powerful vocals can\nactually be.\n\nEven as Fireflight stakes its most authoritative claim in high-decibel rock, the\nmultifaceted act also renders two masterful piano-based ballads. When Dawn\nassures us of GodÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s personal and intervening nature in the strings-enriched\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Name,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s immediately evident her emotive vocals are equally poignant in an\nintimate musical framework. Its counterpart, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Recovery Begins,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ is an artful\nvibefest as the band gently invites the Still Small Voice to speak forth.\n\nAt a time when countless Americans are struggling with feelings of inadequacy in\ntodayÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s fragile job market, Fireflight offers the ascending rock track ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´All I\nNeed to BeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ as a prayerful reminder of where a believerÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s identity should truly\nreside. As Dawn explains, many people of faith experience recurring anxiety as\nthey seek GodÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s will for their lives. Instead of seeing their calling to the\nChristian life as being definitive, believers often obsess over vocation as a\npotential calling. Says Dawn, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´I went through a time when I was seeking God\nintensely, asking, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦What is the path YouÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â d have for me? Where should I go?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  And\nI felt like He said to me, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦My path covers the whole world, and I walk in love.ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â \nI felt like what He was saying to me was that as long as I am walking in love\nand listening for His leading, it doesnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t matter where I go or what I do, that I\nwill have fulfilled His purposes.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\nEven as Fireflight wrote the songs for For Those Who Wait, Dawn, who tragically\nlost a brother during her youth, saw another ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Hunter ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» diagnosed with brain\ncancer and have to have surgery. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´It really was like reliving your worst\nnightmare, having it come true again,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ she says. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´I just cried out to God, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦If\nwe lose him, what will we do? It will destroy my family, because weÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve only\nbarely recovered from the first time.ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  And God really impressed upon me that all\ngreat people have gone through impossible circumstances. But itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s those things\nthat have defined their character and made them who they are now. That helped me\nto have faith and to have strength to make it through that whole situation, and\nnow HunterÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s doing wonderfully.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ Dawn echoes this insight as she sings, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´IÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â m not\nwhat I have done / IÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â m what IÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve overcome,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ in the moody yet explosive modern\nrock standout, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´What IÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve Overcome.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´We pray earnestly that God will give us good songs that will be able to help\npeople,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ she says. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´And HeÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s come through for us, especially in our weakest\nmoments. ThatÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s when weÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve really gotten the best stuff.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ This awareness of\nGodÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s magnificence amidst personal weakness is a defining trait for Fireflight.\nIt not only frames the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s songwriting, it empowers FireflightÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s rejection of\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´rock starÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ entitlement and enables genuine relationships between the group and\ncountless fans. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´We work collectively as a band to answer every MySpace and\nShoutLife question we get,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ says the lead singer. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´We believe first and foremost\nthe Christian faith is relational. We try to show people GodÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s love, and you\njust canÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t do that unless you care about them.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ This manifests itself most\ndirectly as the band proactively interacts and prays with fans who ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´need to\ntalkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ after concerts.\n\nIn the most urgent cases, Fireflight connects its fans with ministry partners\nsuch as To Write Love on Her Arms, which helps individuals struggling with self\ninjury, depression and addiction, and Dawson McAllisterÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s HopeLine, which gives\nlife guidance to teenagers and young adults. In fact, in a highly unusual move\nfor a band, Fireflight recently took a hope coach from Dawson McAllisterÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s team\nout on tour for its fansÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  benefit.\n\nBeyond immediate relational needs, Fireflight also flexes its muscle in\nfar-reaching compassion and justice efforts. Explains Dawn, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´WeÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â re passionate\nabout helping people both in America and in developing countries, where just a\nlittle can do so much. Jesus was extremely interested in the orphans, and the\npoor, and the widows. That was such a big part of what He did and what He\nemphasized to Christians, what they needed to be doing. As a result,\nFireflightÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s work includes a focused partnership with The Legacy of Hope\nInternational, a ministry committed to serving the most immediate needs of\nCambodiaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s poorest children.\n\nThis active commitment to compassion and justice also serves as a signpost for\nfans as FireflightÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s music encourages them to move beyond their personal\nstruggles and reach out to a world eager to know healing in the waiting. Yes,\nlearn while you wait, but love others in the process. This is the message\nFireflight proclaims loud and true, whether appearing with Franklin Graham at an\noutreach event, singing on national television, or rocking for thousands on\n2010ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Winter Jam Tour Spectacular.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ ThatÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s because, when you get down to it,\nif itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s for those who wait, itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s for everyone.\n\nscene --v2-vbr-new mp3 rip from m4a rlsed in demonoid with artwork included.\n\nenjoy!\n\n[/TGB]\n\n\n- T R A C K  L I S T -\n\n[01] For Those Who Wait                                         [ 4:06]\n[02] Desperate                                                  [ 2:54]\n[03] Fire In My Eyes                                            [ 2:58]\n[04] Core Of My Addiction                                       [ 3:13]\n[05] What I've Overcome                                         [ 3:06]\n[06] Name                                                       [ 3:48]\n[07] New Perspective                                            [ 3:18]\n[08] You Give Me That Feeling                                   [ 3:23]\n[09] All I Need To Be                                           [ 3:35]\n[10] Recovery Begins                                            [ 4:52]\n\nTotal: 35:13 Min.\nSize : 51.97  MB\n\n\n- C O N T A C T -\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eb8884859f8a889fab8f81988d84998d9e85c5888486&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n- G R E E T S -\n\nBig thanks to CHR, XXL, OMNi, WHOA &amp; TN!!!\n\nThanks to all the g00d groups that supports the scene correctly since\nits beginings back in '96, in special SC, FNT, MOD, SiRE, VAG &amp; MTD!\n\nRest in peace:\n\nRNS - Rabid Neurosis\nEGO - &quot;EGO&quot;\naPC - Apocalipse Production Crew\nREV - Revolution\nKSi - Kludge Sound Inc.\nESC - Escape\nTN - Trance Nation\n1REAL - Unreal\n\n&amp; MistahWax :P\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed9265e1a72e999a657ff22a8a650687fe431c8b","amp;dn":"Fireflight-For_Those_Who_Wait-RETAIL-2010-SOM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed9265e1a72e999a657ff22a8a650687fe431c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,146,101,225,167,46,153,154,101,127,242,42,138,101,6,135,254,67,28,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
