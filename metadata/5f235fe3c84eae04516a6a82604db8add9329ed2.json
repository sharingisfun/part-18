Although the animals in the story live in their natural environment, they are anthropomorphised, possessing their own culture, language (Lapine), proverbs, poetry, and mythology. Evoking epic themes, the novel recounts the rabbits' odyssey as they escape the destruction of their warren to seek a place in which to establish a new home, encountering perils and temptations along the way.\n\nThe novel takes its name from the rabbits' destination, Watership Down, a hill in the north of Hampshire, England, near the area where Adams grew up. The story is based on a collection of tales that Adams told to his young children to pass the time on trips to the countryside.\n\nPublished in 1972, Watership Down was Richard Adams' first novel, and is by far his most successful to date. Though it was initially rejected by thirteen publishers before eventually being accepted by Rex Collings Ltd, Watership Down has never been out of print, and was the recipient of several prestigious awards\n\n\nCast:\nSimon Chandler\nTom George\nStephen Tomlin\nChristian Rodska\nIan Brooker\nPeter Meakin\nRobert Lister\nSean Connolly\nColin Rote\nAlison Belbin\nSusan Jeffrey\nBen Crowe\nGraham Padden\nFelicity Jones\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWatership Down - 01 of 02\nWatership Down - 02 of 02\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 56mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n\n[b]\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.\n\nThere is little point in downloading a &quot;Torrent&quot; and then recreating a &quot;Torrent&quot; using the same files.\n\nThe fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,\n\nAll you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the &quot;same&quot; files and make both have less seeders.\n\n\n[/b]\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f235fe3c84eae04516a6a82604db8add9329ed2","amp;dn":"Watership+Down+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f235fe3c84eae04516a6a82604db8add9329ed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,35,95,227,200,78,174,4,81,106,106,130,96,77,184,173,217,50,158,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
