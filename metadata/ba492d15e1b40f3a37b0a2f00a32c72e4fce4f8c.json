It was recorded live at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey on September 11, 1999. In addition to being the third live release by Dave Matthews Band, Listener Supported was filmed by PBS for an In the Spotlight special, and the entire concert was released on VHS and DVD the same year. The title of this release is taken from PBS's &quot;supported by viewers like you&quot;. It is currently the only Dave Matthews Band live album to not contain the date or location in the title. This is because part of the broadcast agreement allowed PBS to release their own audio CD version of the television special. The band stepped in and participated in the production of the disc but didn't indicate that it was a live release in the title because they were ultimately unsatisfied with that night's performance.[citation needed] Listener Supported was also the first live release to feature keyboardist Butch Taylor and &quot;The Lovely Ladies&quot; on vocals. In addition to songs from each of their RCA studio albums, Listener Supported features the previously unreleased songs &quot;#40&quot;, &quot;True Reflections&quot; (sung by Boyd Tinsley), and the Heartbeat intro to &quot;Pantala Naga Pampa&quot;, as well as the full band versions of &quot;#36&quot;, &quot;Granny&quot; and &quot;Long Black Veil&quot;..\n\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Intro\n[02] Pantala Naga Pampa\n[03] Rapunzel\n[04] Rhyme And Reason\n[05] The Stone\n[06] #41\n[07] Crash Into Me\n[08] Jimi Thing\n[09] #36\n[10] Warehouse\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:12m:49s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Too Much\n[02] True Reflections\n[03] Two Step\n[04] Granny\n[05] Stay (Wasting Time)\n[06] #40\n[07] Long Black Veil\n[08] Don't Drink The Water\n[09] Intro To...\n[10] All Along The Watchtower\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 01h:05m:34s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 02h:18m:23s\nTotal File Size....................... 949mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
