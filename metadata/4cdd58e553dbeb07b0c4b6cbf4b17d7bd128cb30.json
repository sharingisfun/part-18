But where I live, radio stations only play &quot;Mr Rock And Roll&quot; and &quot;This Is The Life&quot;. I do not understand. Amy has many other songs that are great. These 10 songs are my favorite songs of Amy MacDonald. Write to your radio station and ask them to play these songs as well! Cheers.\n(Bitrate is 320 kbps)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cdd58e553dbeb07b0c4b6cbf4b17d7bd128cb30","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+Amy+MacDonald","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cdd58e553dbeb07b0c4b6cbf4b17d7bd128cb30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,221,88,229,83,219,235,7,176,196,182,203,244,177,125,123,209,40,203,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
