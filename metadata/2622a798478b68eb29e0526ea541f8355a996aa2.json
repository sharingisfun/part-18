I had already given up on the idea of finding any &quot;High Definition Quality&quot; or even &quot;Medium Quality&quot; video content of PJ Harvey anywhere online. And believe you me, I've searched.\n\nAnyway, that source (it can be found here on piratebay as &quot;torrent 8912402&quot; if you want to take a look) seemed like a promising candidate for an amateur digital remastering job, and since DIY was the going &quot;best bet&quot; I produced this video.\n\nBTW. A sample is included if you want to check it out first.\n\nI think this version, as it stands, qualifies as HDTV at least in visual quality, at 1340x724 with about an 8000 Kbps video data rate it has rich colors, nice smooth gradients and nearly crystal clear definition for most fine details. Unfortunately the audio from the source was only a 128 Kbps (CBR) MP3 (decent, but nothing to write home about). Although I did re-normalize the volume so it sounds pretty good.\n\nIf another version of this concert exists *somewhere* then, regardless of its video quality, if it has higher audio definition, then one could use any (de)multiplexer to replace the MP3 audio here for almost full restoration of the original broadcast.\n\n*************************************************************\n\nHere is the track list:\n\nTracks:\n1.
