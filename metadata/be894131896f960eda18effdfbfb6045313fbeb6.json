The only way you're not going to like For Those About to Rock is if you compare it to Back in Black, which is understandable, but for me personally I enjoy the album to the same extent as Back In Black. \n\nThe title track was inspired by a the saying &quot;For those about to die, we salute you&quot; and the band simply changed a word. The song features cannon noises which build up for a grand finale. It is a concert staple, and justifiably so, but there's plenty more noteworthy tunes, among them are the verse-riff tandem of &quot;Inject the venom&quot;, the relentless rocking of &quot;Snowballed&quot;, &quot;Night of the long knives&quot; had a Back in Black-style groove, &quot;Breaking the rules&quot; is an anthemic, semi-bounce track. I recommend &quot;For those about to Rock&quot; wholeheartedly. \n\nby Strech\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - For Those About To Rock (We Salute You).wma       \n02 - I Put The Finger On You.wma                       \n03 - Let's Get It Up.wma                               \n04 - Inject The Venom.wma                              \n05 - Snowballed.wma                                    \n06 - Evil Walks.wma                                    \n07 - C.
