In addition to the instrument-based battles of the original, Ulala may also need to demonstrate her vocal talents to defeat some baddies in this adventure.\n \nGraphics have been enhanced in this special edition, with fully rendered backgrounds and real-time camera work. As in the original game, new outfits earned in the main campaign become available in the Costume Room and rescued hostages may be able to offer advice. The strangely familiar-looking &quot;Space Michael&quot; also returns, to give valuable instruction to Space Channel 5's star reporter.\n\nA two player co-operative mode allows friends to both control Ulala's actions with one player keeping charge of the direction buttons and the other in charge of the 'Hey' and 'Chu' buttons. While a two player 'dance off' can also be played where Ulala and the Morolians must out dance one another. \n\nItems and costumes discovered in the main game mode and Ulala Dance mode can be viewed and selected for use in the Costume Room. As in the first game, the character profile book referees to all character hostages you've rescued in the game, giving you an in-depth profile on each one. They also give clues on where to get items and where the hidden input points may be.\n \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Two engaging storylines, groovy techno tunes, fashionably in vogue characters, \n  and gameplay that players of all ages and sexes will enjoy. \n\n* Take part in 'Rhythm Battles,' in which Ulala takes control of a musical \n  instrument and plays in time with her opponent. \n\n* Give Ulala's singing voice a workout in the 'Lyrics Battle' mode. \n\n* Additional two player mode allows you and a friend to play co-operatively.\n\n* 100's of funky levels to get down to. \n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fefae4ff67389e602f022d1e7e25ed54a84365f","amp;dn":"Space+Channel+5+-+Special+Edition+%5BNtsc%5D+%5B2-Disc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fefae4ff67389e602f022d1e7e25ed54a84365f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,239,174,79,246,115,137,230,2,240,34,209,231,226,94,213,74,132,54,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
