But her legacy lives on, through her cookbooks and recipes, and in the handwritten notebooks filled with her thoughts on how to select the best ingredients &quot;Ingredienti.&quot; Her husband and longtime collaborator Victor has translated and transcribed these vignettes on how to buy and what to do with the fresh produce used in Italian cooking, the elements of an essential pantry, and salumi. \r\n\r\nBefore you know how to cook, you must know how to shop. From Artichokes to Zucchini, Anchovies to Ziti, &quot;Ingredienti&quot; offers succinct and compelling advice on how to choose vegetables, pasta, olive oil, Parmigiano Reggiano, prosciutto, and all of the key elements of Marcella's classic meals. Organic isn t necessarily best, boxed pasta can be better than fresh. Marcella s authoritative wisdom and surprising tips will change the way you cook. Her clear, practical guidance in acquiring the components of good cooking is helpful wherever you choose to shop in supermarkets, farmers markets, specialty food stores, or online. \r\n\r\nBased on sixty years of almost daily visits to the market to choose the ingredients of that day's meal, &quot;Ingredienti&quot; is a life's work, distilled an expression of Marcella's judgments, advice, and suggestions. Uncomplicated and precise, this volume will be essential to home cooks eager to produce meals in the same delicious style Marcella was the first to introduce to America.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:627395d9a0dafb8bd2a8bcc4d5c708b64a82cebc","amp;dn":"Ingredienti+-+Marcella%27s+Guide+to+the+Market+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"627395d9a0dafb8bd2a8bcc4d5c708b64a82cebc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,115,149,217,160,218,251,139,210,168,188,196,213,199,8,182,74,130,206,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
