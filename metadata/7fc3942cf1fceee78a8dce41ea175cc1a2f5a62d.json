Also living and working in the hotel is Nancy, whom Min took in some years ago as an abandoned girl. Now that Nancy is older, the truant officer and the police think that she should be moved to a different environment, and Min is torn between her attachment to Nancy and her concern that the waterfront may not be the best place for a young woman. Matters are brought to a head by the sudden re-appearance of Belle, Nancy's disreputable mother.\n\nMarie Dressler\t\tMin Divot\nWallace Beery\t\tBill, a fisherman\n\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 4mn\n      Bit rate : 1 369 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.500\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Standard : NTSC\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.132\n      Stream size : 636 MiB (91%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 4mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 120 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 55.7 MiB (8%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 509 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc3942cf1fceee78a8dce41ea175cc1a2f5a62d","amp;dn":"Min+and+Bill+%281930%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc3942cf1fceee78a8dce41ea175cc1a2f5a62d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,195,148,44,241,252,238,231,138,141,206,65,234,23,92,193,162,245,166,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
