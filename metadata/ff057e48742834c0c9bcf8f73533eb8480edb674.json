Our perceptionâ€”of ourselves and the world around usâ€”is much more malleable than we realize. This self-deception influences every major aspect of our personal and social life, including relationships, sex, politics, careers, and health.  \r\n     In Kidding Ourselves, Joseph Hallinan offers a nuts-and-bolts look at how this penchant shapes our everyday lives, from the medicines we take to the decisions we make. It shows, for instance, just how much the power of many modern medicines, particularly anti-depressants and painkillers, is largely in our heads. Placebos in modern-day life extend beyond hospitals, to fake thermostats and â€œelevator closeâ€ buttons that donâ€™t really workâ€¦but give the perception that they do.           \r\n     Kidding Ourselves brings together a variety of subjects, linking seemingly unrelated ideas in fascinating and unexpected ways. And ultimately, it shows that deceiving ourselves is not always negative or foolish. As increasing numbers of researchers are discovering, it can be incredibly useful, providing us with the resilience we need to persevere, in the boardroom, bedroom, and beyond.  \r\n     Provocative, accessible, and easily applicable to multiple facets of everyday life, Kidding Ourselves is an extraordinary new exploration of our mindâ€™s flexibility","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff057e48742834c0c9bcf8f73533eb8480edb674","amp;dn":"Kidding+Ourselves%3A+The+Hidden+Power+of+Self-Deception","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff057e48742834c0c9bcf8f73533eb8480edb674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,5,126,72,116,40,52,192,201,188,248,247,53,51,235,132,128,237,182,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
