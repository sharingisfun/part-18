Looking at both traditional and emerging areas, such as public order offences and corporate manslaughter, it offers a broad and thorough perspective on the subject. Material is organised thematically and is clearly signposted at the beginning of each section to allow the student to navigate successfully through the different fields. This new edition looks at topical issues such as policing, the Serious Crime Act 2007, and reform of the Fraud Act 2006. Relevant case law and extracts from the most topical and engaging debates on the subject give the subject immediacy. The book is essential for both undergraduate and postgraduate study of criminal law and justice.\n\n\n\nPaperback: 944 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 4 edition (June 28, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521737397\nISBN-13: 978-0521737395","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6af2dcf7bb559a88a5178c5773042eba3d2d953","amp;dn":"Reconstructing+Criminal+Law+-Text+and+Materials%2C4th+ed%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6af2dcf7bb559a88a5178c5773042eba3d2d953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,175,45,207,123,181,89,168,138,81,120,197,119,48,66,235,163,210,217,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
