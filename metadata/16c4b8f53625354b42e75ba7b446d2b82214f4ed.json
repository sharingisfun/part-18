Bach) Schickele&amp;#039;s award-winning themed classical music education and humor program, produced from 1992 to the late 1990s and distributed in repeats until 2007.  After I posted the complete set of the syndication shows, a fellow fan uncovered these truly lost episodes-- airchecks recorded in the early 90s of shows which were not included in the repeat rotation.  Five of these shows haven&amp;#039;t been heard by anybody in over 15 years.  Due to the circumstances, there are some audio flaws which are noted below, but hey, where are you going to get better copies?  Here&amp;#039;s what we have:\n\n15: Musical Criticism\n20: Baroque Beatles Book-- unfortunately, this is missing about 15 minutes which did not record audibly.  It cuts out at around 40:00 in and returns with an extra cut played after the Mozart theme music (not listed on the playlist).\n35: And I Quote...\n39: The Devil To Pay\n40: Varieties of Organic Experience-- unfortunately, this one has bad audio which I have cleaned up somewhat for about the first 9-1/2 minutes.  It&amp;#039;s audible, but far from pleasurable.  After \\&quot;Marrakech Express&quot; it plays normally.\n135: Clothes Encounters (complete version of show which is in edited form in previous torrent)\nListener Special #10: special pledge drive version of the show, with most of public radio pledge stuff edited out (a little left for context).  Runs about 36 minutes.\n\nThanks to Ron for providing these and if anyone else has more airchecks of non-repeated shows, post a comment and let&amp;#039;s get them out there!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c4b8f53625354b42e75ba7b446d2b82214f4ed","amp;dn":"Schickele+Mix+Radio+Show+Episodes+-+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c4b8f53625354b42e75ba7b446d2b82214f4ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,196,184,245,54,37,53,75,66,231,91,167,180,70,210,184,34,20,244,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
