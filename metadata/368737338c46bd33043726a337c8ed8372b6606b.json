Beginning with the Safavid dynasty of the 16th and 17th centuries, he traces IranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s political and military progress to its dramatic turning point in 1979. In doing so, Farrokh demonstrates how IranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s current bellicosity on the world stage was shaped by centuries of military defeat and humiliating foreign influences from the likes of Russia and Great Britain.\n \nIncluding illustrations and photographs, this book provides an unparalleled investigation into the bloody history of modern Iran.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Iran-War-1500-1988-General-Military/dp/B006QS2P4O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327111771&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Iran-War-1500-1988-General-Military/dp/B006QS2P4O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327111771&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:368737338c46bd33043726a337c8ed8372b6606b","amp;dn":"Iran+at+War%3A+1500-1988+%28Osprey+General+Military%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"368737338c46bd33043726a337c8ed8372b6606b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,135,55,51,140,70,189,51,4,55,38,163,55,200,237,131,114,182,96,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
