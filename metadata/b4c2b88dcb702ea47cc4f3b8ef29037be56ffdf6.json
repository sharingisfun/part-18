The aim of the book is to provide an introductory overview which covers a broad range of tried-and-tested tools. Descriptions of concepts, philosophies, challenges, methodologies and workflows give the reader an understanding on how to make optimal decisions under uncertainty for Earth Science problems.\n\nThe book covers key issues such as: Spatial and time aspect; large complexity and dimensionality;   computation power; costs of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“engineeringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the Earth; uncertainty in the modeling and decision process.
