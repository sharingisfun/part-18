Sossamon left due to conflicts with her acting schedule and was replaced by Stella Mozgawa. With a dedicated lineup, the band began to experiment with murky spaciousness and stripped-down arrangements, and gained the attention of former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante. In 2009, they self-released their debut EP, Exquisite Corpse (which was mixed by Frusciante). After a successful showing at CMJ, they signed with Rough Trade and set to work recording their full-length debut for the label. The Fool arrived in October 2010, featuring more fleshed-out songcraft and stronger performances. After taking a few years to follow up their debut and citing their desire to experiment more with sounds and really connect as a group, the band released the lead single &quot;Love Is to Die,&quot; which was featured on a Calvin Klein advert in September 2013. Their eponymous sophomore album followed in early 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce02d679e3081eb1ee8fd6984246515b25673477","amp;dn":"Warpaint+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce02d679e3081eb1ee8fd6984246515b25673477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,2,214,121,227,8,30,177,238,143,214,152,66,70,81,91,37,103,52,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
