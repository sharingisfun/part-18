The series is a spin-off of a recurring series of comedy sketches on The Carol Burnett Show, called The Family, which lasted from 1974 to 1978. Mama's Family also has roots in the 1982 made-for-TV movie, named after Mama's daughter Eunice (played by Carol Burnett).\n\nMama's Family first aired on NBC, debuting on January 22, 1983. After a series of timeslot changes, the program's ratings dropped and the network cancelled the series. The final episode of the original run aired on April 7, 1984.[1] NBC would continue to air the series in reruns until September 1985.\n\nIn September 1986, Mama's Family was picked up for the first-run syndication market by Joe Hamilton Productions and Lorimar-Telepictures. The first-run syndication version of the series was retooled and several characters, including Eunice and Ed (played by Harvey Korman), were written out with two new characters added to the mix.\n\nThe syndicated version of Mama's Family garnered substantially higher ratings than it did during its network run and became the highest rated show in first-run syndication. The series ran for an additional four seasons, ending with a series finale on February 24, 1990.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e50d329746dd4219a2e3e37f260baf67646f12fb","amp;dn":"MAMAS+FAMILY+%5BCOMPLETE%5D%5BVERIFIED-VIDZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e50d329746dd4219a2e3e37f260baf67646f12fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,13,50,151,70,221,66,25,162,227,227,127,38,11,175,103,100,111,18,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
