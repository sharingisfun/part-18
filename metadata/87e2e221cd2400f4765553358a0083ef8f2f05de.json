From here, you proceed directly to &quot;must-know&quot; information, including how to determine wire sizes and make a variety of common switch connections. Different types of electrical power panels are also examined in detail. Discussion of general wiring practices and circuit protectors, as well as an introduction to transformers and three-phase and single-phase motors, round out the comprehensive coverage.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Author:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStephen L.
