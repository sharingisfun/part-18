Hard life lessons have taught her that fairy tales are children's stories, and fate is cruel.\n\nBurying her hopes, she's spent the last sixteen years focused and driven toward her career, and it's landed her with a job at the White House with a gem of a boyfriend. But when her high school love, Adam Kincaid, walks into the White House as a BBC reporter, Nicki's world is thrown into turmoil as she relives their past.
