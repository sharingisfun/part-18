In forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan, Reichs has created a detective fiction heroine whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant to the bone. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every minute in the morgue with Tempe is golden,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says The New York Times Book Review. In the acclaimed authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thrilling new novel, Brennan is at the top of her game in a battle of wits against the most monstrous adversary she has ever encountered.\n\nUnexpectedly called in to the Charlotte PDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cold Case Unit, Dr. Temperance Brennan wonders why sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been asked to meet with a homicide cop whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a long way from his own jurisdiction. The shocking answer: Two child murders, separated by thousands of miles, have one thing in commonÃ¢â‚¬â€the killer. Years ago, Anique Pomerleau kidnapped and murdered a string of girls in Canada, then narrowly eluded capture. It was a devastating defeat for her pursuers, Brennan and police detective Andrew Ryan. Now, as if summoned from their nightmares, Pomerleau has resurfaced in the United States, linked to victims in Vermont and North Carolina. When another child is snatched, the reign of terror promises to continueÃ¢â‚¬â€unless Brennan can rise to the challenge and make good on her second chance to stop a psychopath.\n\nBut Brennan will have to draw her bitter ex-partner out of exile, keep the local police and feds from one anotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s throats, and face more than just her own demons as she stalks the deadliest of predators into the darkest depths of madness.\n\nIn Bones Never Lie, Kathy Reichs never fails to satisfy readers looking for psychological suspense thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than skin-deep.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
