Elin Larsson, Cory Berry and Zack Anderson, all just in their early Twenties, formed a group which should quickly become one of the most acclaimed and interesting bands iaround. Behold the birth of a new musical experience, an experience we thought was long gone, lost in time and space. Behold the birth of BLUES PILLS. The young American-Swedish-French quartet create a very unique, intense and extraordinary rock atmosphere while at the same time having a major mainstream appeal that takes you right back to the time of BLUES PILLS' ancestors Aretha Franklin, The Original Fleetwood Mac, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Cream. Driving bass lines, grooving drums and guitar solos from another planet by the only 17 year old Dorian Sorriaux, harmonized and tied together with such easiness, such delight, by Elin's incredible voice, sometimes singing in her mother tongue Swedish.\n\nWith the idea to take soul music, combined with blues and rock'n'roll and turn it into a new force of unimaginable energy, intensity and freshness, their blonde archangel &amp; soul-saviour Elin Larsson will guide you gently into a new world, the band's empire of soulful rock; her beautiful voice seems to be taking you beyond the stars to an infinite universe on a journey that appears endless in time, yet profound and revealing. Elin's powerful lyrics are full of emotions, her jazzy-soulful voice never falls into the trap of an aestheticization of kitsch, but unfolds an outstanding beauty itself with a refreshing new take on the timeless and unquestionably noble art of rocknroll, touching your soul. All this is realised on the band's stunning 10-track debut produced by Don Alsterberg (GRAVEYARD), wrapped in the incredible '60's style artwork of Marijke Koger-Dunham.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7945e3b0afa0b3d176237679f922dde0a9a0a5e","amp;dn":"Blues+Pills+-+Blues+Pills+%282014%29+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7945e3b0afa0b3d176237679f922dde0a9a0a5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,148,94,59,10,250,11,61,23,98,55,103,159,146,45,222,10,154,10,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
