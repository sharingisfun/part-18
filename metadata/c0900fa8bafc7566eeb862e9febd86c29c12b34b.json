(The first list of Dharma terminology was a hot item in those days: Dungsey Trinley Norbu Rinpoche, for instance, asked me for a second copy, because 'his oldest son had snapped up the other.') Later, coinciding with the first laptops models in the early 80's, these scraps of paper migrated into electronic files. Other translators added their glossaries and in 1996 the first version was published with 72,000 entries. A second followed in 1998 with 84,000 entries. The electronic formats were thanks to Chris Gianottis and Gerry Wiener. A list of everyone to whom thanks are owed is included in the section under acknowledgements.\n\nNow the Rangjung Yeshe Dictionary is approximately 84,000, and with the inclusion of the efforts of Ives Waldo, Jim Valby, Richard Barron, Mark Seibold and others, the size is 276,000. To give a comparison, the printable version - set in Autumn 8 points - is about 2950 pages.\n\nOriginal Title: The Rangjung Yeshe: Tibetan-English Dictionary of Buddhist Culture (Version 3)\nPublisher: Rangjung Yeshe Translations and Publications\nAuthor(s): Erik Pema Kunsang\nYear: 2003 (Version 3)\nFormat: PDF\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
