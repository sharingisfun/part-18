His sacred music, organ and choral works, and other instrumental music had an enthusiasm and seeming freedom that concealed immense rigor. Bach's use of counterpoint was brilliant and innovative, and the immense complexities of his compositional style -- which often included religious and numerological symbols that seem to fit perfectly together in a profound puzzle of special codes -- still amaze musicians today. Many consider him the greatest composer of all time.\n\n\nGenre................: Classical\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2006\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n\nCD1 - Brandenburg Concertos 1-3\n\nBrandenburg Concerto No.1 In F Major, BWV 1046 - I.
