French intelligence estimated that Britain could withstand a German onslaught for no more that 3 weeks. Hitlers forces had enjoyed unbroken, astonishing success, and even the highest levels of power in London thought Hitler could not be beaten.\n\nChurchill alone never faltered, announcing to the British people that his aim was Victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror; victory however long and hard the road may be.\n\n                 _______________________________________________\n\n\nI couldn't resist uploading this (got it at MVGroup) after having seen &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5007137/The_Gathering_Storm_%282002_HBO_Winston_Churchill_Drama%29\n\nand &quot;Into The Storm&quot;:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5074091/Churchill_at_War_-_Into_the_Storm\n\nFor you Churchill fans, this is a must see!\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911a0f92a981d024554ac9483a9ea05978f0a634","amp;dn":"Churchill.+The+War+File","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911a0f92a981d024554ac9483a9ea05978f0a634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,26,15,146,169,129,208,36,85,74,201,72,58,158,160,89,120,240,166,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
