Whatever you call it, this collection of traditional-style songs and ballads is John Renbourn's finest solo album. Acoustic six and 12-string guitars, played in Renbourn's inimitable style, accompany period instruments, reeds, and even a bit of sitar and Indian percussion.\n\nRenbourn's remarkable skills are on display throughout, but this is not merely a display of chops. The playing is entirely in service to the song. When Renbourn reels off a dazzlingly fleet-fingered solo on a piece like &quot;White Fishes&quot; or &quot;Sweet Potato,&quot; it's because that's what the song needed. The album gets progressively jazzier as it goes on, until the closing &quot;Seven Up&quot; suggests Django Reinhardt set loose in a medieval fair. Wonderful stuff, and one of the finest guitar-instrumental albums ever.\n\nRecorded at Sound Techniques, London, England. Includes liner notes by Colin Harper.\n\nPersonnel: John Renbourn (vocals, guitar); Ray Warleigh (flute); Terry Cox (glockenspiel, drums, cymbals, finger cymbals, percussion).\n\nLiner Note Author: Colin Harper.\n\nRecording information: Sound Techniques Studio, Chelsea, London, England.\n\nArranger: John Renbourn.\n \n cd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad762dfb964a99fc08a4047c746399c662f459ea","amp;dn":"John+Renbourn...Sir+John+Alot%281968%29remastered%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad762dfb964a99fc08a4047c746399c662f459ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,118,45,251,150,74,153,252,8,164,4,124,116,99,153,198,98,244,89,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
