But, his latest inspiration \n was a chance encounter with a vintage 1937 electric Hawaiian guitar that shaped \n his new solo album, Glaciation.\n\n OÃƒÂ¢??Hearn, who had been working in his Nashville home studio toward the \n completion of an all-together different album, scrapped the yearÃƒÂ¢??s worth of \n work to meld the distinct character of his newest instrument to a host of other \n partners. Working from instinct, he caught a wave -- and brought aboard an 18th \n century acoustic bass, an Analogue Modular Synthesizer, fretless bass, piano, \n electric guitars and assorted vintage studio gear (EQs, Filters and Signal \n Processors) -- to record Glaciation in chronological sequence.\n\n &quot;Just why a Hawaiian guitar would act as catalyst to conjure up striking \n images of the arctic did not occur to me at first. It wasn&amp;#039;t until well into \n making the record that I stopped to consider the irony: it made sense&quot;.\n\n Glaciation continues OÃƒÂ¢??HearnÃƒÂ¢??s path of evoking the sensations of different \n atmospheres through beautifully textured sounds. His last two albums Beautiful \n World and Slow Time painted different surroundings than GlaciationÃƒÂ¢??s arctic \n beauty. The first illustrates the extraordinary beauty of the natural world, \n while the second revels in thoughtfully conjuring the passage of time. Slow \n Time also marked a departure for O&amp;#039;Hearn, in that he ventured into the \n experimental realm characterized by musical movements of the 20th century.\n\nNFO INFO\n--------\n NFO Created:            27-Oct-2007  16:54:18\n NFO/SFV created by: Mp3BookHelper http://mp3bookhelper.sourceforge.net/\n\n===============================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82e25a61a00919a2870020c6a71958f6dca25ff3","amp;dn":"Patrick+O%5C%27Hearn+-+Glaciation+%28New+Age%2C+2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82e25a61a00919a2870020c6a71958f6dca25ff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,226,90,97,160,9,25,162,135,0,32,198,167,25,88,246,220,162,95,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
