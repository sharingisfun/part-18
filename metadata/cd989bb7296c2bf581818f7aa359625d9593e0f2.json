As with &quot;The Ghost And The Darkness&quot;, Goldsmith fancies African rhythms that fit perfectly to the soul of the movie, if it ever had one. The action music is fantastic, especially 'Bail Out', 'Hipo Attack', and 'Amy's Nightmare'.\nIt's too bad that this good piece of music was written for a terrible movie. However, Jerry Goldsmith knows how to make his music stand on its own.
