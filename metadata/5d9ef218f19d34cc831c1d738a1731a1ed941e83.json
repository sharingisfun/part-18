Ask ten men and you'll get ten vague, conflicting answers. Unlike any book of its kind, The Way of Men offers a simple, straightforward answer-without getting bogged down in religion, morality, or politics. It's a guide for understanding who men have been and the challenges men face today. The Way of Men captures the silent, stifling rage of men everywhere who find themselves at odds with the over-regulated, over-civilized, politically correct modern world. If you've ever closed your eyes and wished for one day as a lion, this book is for you.\n\n192 pages\nPublisher: Dissonant Hum (April 10, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0985452307\nISBN-13: 978-0985452308","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d9ef218f19d34cc831c1d738a1731a1ed941e83","amp;dn":"The+Way+of+Men+%282012%29+by+Jack+Donovan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d9ef218f19d34cc831c1d738a1731a1ed941e83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,158,242,24,241,157,52,204,131,28,29,115,138,23,49,161,237,148,30,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
