Cable and Deadpool go on (mis)adventures, shooting things and killing people. All in a good days' work. There is plenty of fun banter along the way with Cable the deadly serious straight man to Deadpool's...Deadpool. The X-Men were transitioning from Grant Morrison to Joss Whedon at this point, with Claremont shifting back to Uncanny X-Men, and these two fan favorite fools were largely allowed to their own thing. Ther are overlaps with Civil War and other crossover events of course, right up to Messiah Complex. After that event, in 2008 both Cable and Deadpool received their own titles once again. All issues are digital; the first 34 are care of Son of Ultron-Empire, the next three are by G85-Empire and the last 13 are courtesy of Nahga-Empire. Thanks those rippers for these copies - please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fefb496cad2e1c055fa87429daad6c635f49ab7f","amp;dn":"Cable+%26amp%3B+Deadpool+01-50+%282004-2008%2C+Dgtl%2C+SoU%2BG85%2BNahga-E%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fefb496cad2e1c055fa87429daad6c635f49ab7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,251,73,108,173,46,28,5,95,168,116,41,218,173,108,99,95,73,171,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
