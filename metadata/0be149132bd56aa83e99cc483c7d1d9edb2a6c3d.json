His disparate influences included doo wop music and avant-garde classical music; although he led groups that could be called rock &amp; roll bands for much of his career, he used them to create a hybrid style that bordered on jazz and complicated, modern serious music, sometimes inducing orchestras to play along. As if his music were not challenging enough, he overlay it with highly satirical and sometimes abstractly humorous lyrics and song titles that marked him as coming out of a provocative literary tradition that included Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg and edgy comedians like Lenny Bruce. Nominally, he was a popular musician, but his recordings rarely earned significant airplay or sales, yet he was able to gain control of his recorded work and issue it successfully through his own labels while also touring internationally, in part because of the respect he earned from a dedicated cult of fans and many serious musicians, and also because he was an articulate spokesman who promoted himself into a media star through extensive interviews he considered to be a part of his creative effort just like his music. The Mothers of Invention, the '60s group he led, often seemed to offer a parody of popular music and the counterculture (although he affected long hair and jeans, Zappa was openly scornful of hippies and drug use). By the '80s, he was testifying before Congress in opposition to censorship (and editing his testimony into one of his albums). But these comic and serious sides were complementary, not contradictory. In statement and in practice, Zappa was an iconoclastic defender of the freest possible expression of ideas. And most of all, he was a composer far more ambitious than any other rock musician of his time and most classical musicians, as well.\n\n\n\nTHE BEST BAND YOU NEVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE\n\nOne of three collections from the 1988 world tour, THE BEST BAND YOU NEVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE is a portrait of one of Zappa's most accomplished bands. Unfortunately, this band self-destructed in mid-tour and never completed their scheduled appearances. Hence, the title stands for the fans that couldn't see this amazing group live. The vocals of Ike Willis and Mike Keneally, the rhythmic acrobatics of Chad Wackerman, Ed Mann and Scott Thunes, the powerful horn section including the Fowler brothers, keyboardist/vocalist Bobby Martin--it all adds up to one of the most musically agile bands Zappa ever commanded.\n\nThere are the usual Zappa favorites on disc one with &quot;Cosmic Debris&quot; and &quot;Zomby Woof.&quot; The band also gets to flex its muscles on the instrumentals &quot;Zoot Allures&quot; and &quot;Sofa #1.&quot; Disc two captures all the zany behavior that could be preserved on tape as bizarre covers of &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot; start things off. Snippets of &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,&quot; &quot;The Godfather Theme&quot; and &quot;Bonanza&quot; escalate into a diatribe by right-wing character Brother A. West and several songs denouncing televangelist Jimmy Swaggart. The finale of &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; ties everything back together in grand Zappa style.\n\nRecorded live in 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOLERO\n\nWhen this CD came out, there was a LOT of trouble with Zappa's &quot;Bolero&quot; cover. Ravel's estate had tons of objections to it, and the result was that Zappa had to remove &quot;Bolero&quot; from the European version, where the estate's copyright was still effective. (Rumour has it that Zappa even had to publish a written apology somewhere, stating that it was never his &quot;intent&quot; to &quot;pervert&quot; the composition, or somesuch.) &quot;Bolero&quot; stayed on American versions. Japanese versions without &quot;Bolero&quot; have been reported.\n\n\n\nDifferent Covers\n\nWhen this CD came out in America and Europe, the cover was a picture of the band on stage. It turned out that Zappa had used this picture without the photographer's permission, so the cover had to be revoked. Zappa replaced it with a blank, black cover. The Japanese CD had a different cover, drawn by Cal Schenkel, which was used for the 1995 re-issue. (Perhaps the Japanese CD came out after the original cover had already been stopped.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nFrank Zappa (lead guitar, synthesizer, vocals)\nIke Willis (rhythm guitar, synthesizer, vocals)\nMike Keneally (rhythm guitar, synthesizer, vocals)\nBobby Martin (keyboards, vocals)\nEd Mann (vibes, marimba, electronic percussion)\nWalt Fowler (trumpet, flugel horn, synthesizer)\nBruce Fowler (trombone)\nPaul Carman (alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, baritone saxophone)\nAlbert Wing (tenor saxophone)\nKurt McGettrick (baritone saxophone, bass saxophone, contrabass clarinet)\nScott Thunes (electric bass, mini-moog)\nChad Wackerman (drums, electronic percussion)\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\nDisc One\n\n&quot;Heavy Duty Judy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:04\n&quot;Ring of Fire&quot; (Merle Kilgore, June Carter) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:00\n&quot;Cosmik Debris&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n&quot;Find Her Finer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n&quot;Who Needs the Peace Corps?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40\n&quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; (George C.
