It covers the 1960s with an emphasis on 1961-62, and includes many of the best selections from Kirk LPs like Rip, Rig and Panic, We Free Kings and Domino. Those separate albums should be of more interest to fans, leaving this disc as an adequate collection for beginners or those unsure of where to start. ~ John Bush, All Music Guide\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 27 - Roland Kirk Tracks:\n01  Three For The Festival 3:09 \n02  Blue Rol 6:11 \n03  Reeds And Deeds 5:19 \n04  Hip Chops 3:34 \n05  From Bechet, Byas, And Fats 6:29 \n06  Berkshire Blues 2:48 \n07  A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square 5:17 \n08  March On, Swan Lake 4:01 \n09  The Haunted Melody3:39 \n10  Meeting On TerminiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Corner 3:40 \n11  Rolando 3:49 \n12  Blues For Alice 4:09 \n13  Black Diamond 5:24 \n14  You Did It, You Did It 2:28 \n15  Where Monk And Mingus Live/ LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Call This 4:09 \n16  Blues For C &amp; T 3:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d6221ef5f86da6b235294ff21ee54602473cb5","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+27+-+Roland+Kirk+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+224-320%5D%5Bh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75d6221ef5f86da6b235294ff21ee54602473cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,214,34,30,245,248,109,166,178,53,41,79,242,30,229,70,2,71,60,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
