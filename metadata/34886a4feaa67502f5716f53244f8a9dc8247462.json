Hundred Years Ago\n\nThe songs on this disc are either work songs - shanties - or diversionary songs - foc'sle songs or forebitters - sung during the evening dog watch, when the men gathered round a squeeze-box in the foc'sle or, in fair weather, sat around the bitts or around the fore-hatch.\nThe great days of sailor-singing were in the first two thirds of the nineteenth century, when the really fast ships were evolved. When 'If the men don't sing right, the ship don't move right' was the axiom, and a good shanty-man was always sure of a job on a fast clipper.\nRoughly, shanties are of three kinds: capstan shanties, used for such jobs as weighing anchor; halliard shanties for hoisting the heavy yards; short drag shanties for taking in slack or hauling on sheets and braces.\n\n&quot;One of the greatest sea-shanty recordings ever made, and probably the only one ever to get endorsements from the likes of Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. A.L. Lloyd and Ewan MacColl, backed by Alf Edwards (concertina), Ralph Rinzler (guitar, banjo, mandolin), and Steve Benbow (guitar), perform 16 sea shanties, including &quot;Row Bullies Row,&quot; &quot;Old Billy Riley,&quot; &quot;Handsome Cabin Boy,&quot; &quot;South Australia,&quot; &quot;Do Me Ama,&quot; and &quot;Jack Tar,&quot; in their most honest, authentic forms, rich, robust, rough, tough, and delightful, with no compromises to middle-class sensibilities. The sound has held up remarkably well on this classic recording, which constitutes virtually a genuine trip through time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34886a4feaa67502f5716f53244f8a9dc8247462","amp;dn":"A.L.+Lloyd+%26amp%3B+Ewan+MacColl+-+Blow+Boys+Blow+%5B1960%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34886a4feaa67502f5716f53244f8a9dc8247462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,136,106,79,234,166,117,2,245,113,111,83,36,79,138,157,200,36,116,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
