Her past life recall as a child led her to seek physical evidence for her visions of temples, pyramids and ceremonies. This quest brought her to Egypt 23 times, where she conducted extensive academic research, and field work around the Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid, she noted, is a monumental building that spans over 2 acres and is made up of 2.3 million stones. \n\nYet near the Great Pyramid, there are six distinct sites, encompassing a total of 22 pyramids, and these structures worked together as a kind of energy system, at a time when the Nile River ran along side them, she explained. This puts their construction date much further back than what is typically thought. Further, these pyramids couldn't have been made with chisels but rather were constructed with superior light and sound technologies that made use of levitation in moving the blocks, Boulter said.\n\nThe pyramid builders were living in a Golden Age, when humans had expanded senses and higher levels of consciousness, she contended. 2012 marks the time in the 26,000-year 'precessional' cycle when humans begin moving back to this Golden Age, she commented. The Temple of Seti at Abydos contains many symbols that show the understanding of the ancients, including blue, yellow, and red beings that could represent travelers from Sirius and Orion, she added.\n\nSolar Cycle Update\n\nAppearing in the last hour, physicist James McCanney gave an update on the extended lack of sunspot activity. This could push the solar maximum period back to 2014, but when the sun rebounds, its sunspot activity could be fast and furious, he warned.\n\nWebsite(s):\npyramidcode.com\njmccanneyscience.com\n\nBook(s):\nAngels and Archetypes\nPrincipia Meteorologia - The Physics of Sun-Earth Weather\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb7a3f3bc413a9ebf2912e332b70d1e91fe9ca39","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Sep+21+2009+-+Ancient+Egypt+%26+the+Pyramids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb7a3f3bc413a9ebf2912e332b70d1e91fe9ca39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,122,63,59,196,19,169,235,242,145,46,51,43,112,209,233,31,233,202,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
