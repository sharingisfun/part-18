Jones\n\nStoryline\nThe Harper brothers Charlie and Alan are almost opposites but form a great team. They have little in common except their dislike for their mundane, maternally cold and domineering mother, Evelyn. Alan, a compulsively neat chiropractor and control-freak, is thrown out by his manipulative wife Judith who nevertheless gets him to pay for everything and do most jobs in the house. Charlie is a freelance jingle composer and irresistible Cassanova who lives in a luxurious beach-house and rarely gets up before noon. Charlie &quot;temporarily&quot; allows Alan and his son Jake, a food-obsessed, lazy school kid who shuttles between his parents, to move in with them after Alan's separation/divorce. The sitcom revolves around their conflicting lifestyles, raising Jake (who has the efficient, caring dad while having a ball with his fun-loving sugar uncle who teaches him boyish things), and bantering with Evelyn and various other friends and family.\n\nGenres: Comedy\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.78 : 1\nResolution  : 624x352\nFrame rate  : 24fps\nRuntime     : 21 min\nContainer   : Matroska\nEncoder     : Handbrake 0.9.5\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b07166e7cce569846320dad4df20ef2124a60249","amp;dn":"Two+And+A+Half+Men+Season+8+-+MKV+-+Arjunnn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b07166e7cce569846320dad4df20ef2124a60249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,113,102,231,204,229,105,132,99,32,218,212,223,32,239,33,36,166,2,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
