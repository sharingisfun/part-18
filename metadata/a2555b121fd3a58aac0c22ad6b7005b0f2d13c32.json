There's no bass, but the bedrock rhythms are full and rounded with Peyton's slashing rhythm guitar work pushing the tunes into overdrive. &quot;Just Getting By&quot; is a thumping country blues and the lyrics are mostly the hook line repeated over and over, but Persinger's thumping bass drum and Peyton's propulsive slide guitar and devil-may-care vocal make the tune work. &quot;What Go Around Come Around&quot; scolds a local badass with a dose of sardonic humor as the Rev. sings &quot;You can't help stupid, but you can help mean/Is acting bad a habit, is it part of your routine?&quot; &quot;Born Bred Corn Fed&quot; celebrates redneck country living with Peyton's wild swooping slide guitar shooting off sparks, but several songs address the hard time most working people are facing. &quot;Everything's Raising&quot; is a timely protest song that sounds funny -- but the jokes have a bitter taste to them as the Rev. sings about bailouts and crooked lawmakers -- as is &quot;In a Holler Over There,&quot; a country blues that Peyton sings in a warbling voice that calls to mind Dave Von Ronk at his crustiest. Peyton's original songs may sound like the laments you'd hear coming from a Depression-era 78, but they are all recent compositions, and in the new Depression of 2010 they couldn't be more timely.\n\nTrack list:\n1.
