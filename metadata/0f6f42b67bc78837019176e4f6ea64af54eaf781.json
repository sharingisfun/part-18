His father, Billy, tries to stop him to no avail. After he is gone, he picks up a note on the ground and realizes it is an invitation to Bella Swan and Edward Cullen's wedding. Charlie Swan, RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e and Phil Dwyer receive invitations as well.\nAt the Cullen house, Bella is trying on her bridal shoes at Alice Cullen's insistence while the rest of the Cullens are setting up the scenery. Back at home, Bella packs up all of her stuff and reminisces about Jacob's dreamcatcher, which is still hanging on her bed. Edward appears and tells her about a time in his life when he went on his own and fed on humans who were almost as monstrous as he thought he was. Bella talks him out of thinking of himself that way. Just then, Emmett Cullen and Jasper Hale arrive and demand that Edward follow them to his bachelor party. Bella goes to bed and dreams about the Volturi and all of her human friends and family being dead, with Edward and herself stained with blood.\n\nThe next day, Alice and Rosalie Hale prepare Bella while RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e and Charlie arrive to give her an old silver hairclip with sapphires, which had belonged to Bella's grandmother.\nBella grows increasingly anxious and nervous when she walks down the aisle, until she sees Edward and all of her worries disappear. The wedding is a success and Bella and Edward are married. During the reception, Bella is greeted by the Denali Coven, but Irina becomes upset at the Cullens for inviting one of the wolves, Seth Clearwater, since they destroyed Laurent. Jacob arrives and dances with Bella, but he gets angry when he hears that Bella and Edward plan on making love while she is still human, which he foresees as dangerous. The other wolves arrive and stop him before he can make the situation worse.\n\nEdward takes Bella to Isle Esme, a present to Esme Cullen from Carlisle Cullen, for their honeymoon. That night, they consummate their marriage. The next morning, Edward is distraught because he had involuntarily hurt Bella, though she disagrees. They spend the next week exploring the islands and enjoying their honeymoon without making love, but Bella continues to persuade him. One night, she has a dream and wants it so badly to be real that she pleads with Edward and he gives in.\nBack in La Push, Jacob is resentful of Edward and expects Bella to be dead by the time they return, and expects to kill him.\nBella realizes that she is pregnant when she sees her unused tampons and feels something move in her stomach. Edward takes her back to Forks for Carlisle to remove the baby. Unwilling to give up the baby, she calls Rosalie for help.\n\nTwo weeks later, Jacob visits the Cullens and finds Bella pregnant at an unnatural rate. Despite everyone's warnings, Bella is determined to give birth and Rosalie is on her side. When the pack hear about this, Sam Uley decides to kill Bella to prevent the baby from becoming a threat to the nearby humans. Jacob, however, disagrees and embraces his rightful power as Alpha to separate himself from the pack. It doesn't take long before Seth and Leah Clearwater join him. Sam decides to surround the area and wait for an opportunity to strike. The Cullens hide in their house for the time being as they starve.\nBella's condition worsens throughout the days as her body rejects any kind of food. Eventually, Jacob makes a comment and Edward suggests that Bella try drinking human blood to satisfy the baby. She begins to feel better immediately.\nWhen Edward hears the baby's thoughts for the first time and learns that it has goodness and loves her parents, his hatred for the baby disappears immediately. Jacob helps Esme, Carlisle, and Emmett escape to hunt by distracting Embry Call, Paul Lahote, Quil Ateara V, and Jared Cameron. However, they are discovered by the two remaining wolves, Brady Fuller and Collin Littlesea. Back at the house, Bella tells Jacob the names that she has settled for the baby: &quot;Edward Jacob&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ shortened E.J.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ if it is a boy, and &quot;Renesmee&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ derived from RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e and Esme ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ if it is a girl. Shortly after telling them the names, the baby's placenta detaches and Bella goes through an incredibly painful labor, with her spine and several bones being broken by the baby's struggle. Rosalie tries to get the baby out, but loses control when she opens Bella's womb. Edward proceeds with the surgery and acknowledges that the baby is a girl, calling her &quot;Renesmee&quot;. Bella's heart stops beating after the birth, and Edward injects his venom into her system and fights to save her. The venom begins to take effect, but Edward doesn't notice it.\n\nJacob, broken by loss, cries in the backyard while Paul eavesdrops on them. The pack decides to make their move after being informed of Bella's death and confirming the baby's threat to humans. Meanwhile, Jacob goes back inside to kill the baby, who is now in Rosalie 's care; but the moment he looks into her eyes, he imprints on her and all of his previous attachments become severed.\n\nThe pack arrives and a fight erupts between the Cullens and the pack: Leah, Seth, Emmett, Esme, and Carlisle arrive just in time to neutralize their approach. When Sam readies to strike again, Jacob leaps into the backyard and tells them that he has imprinted on Renesmee, which has made her untouchable to the other wolves. Because of this, the wolves are forced to make permanent peace with the Cullens.\nIn the following days, Bella's transformation continues as her body heals itself. The movie ends with everyone standing warily still as Bella opens her eyes, which are now blood-red as a newborn vampire.\nIn a post-credits scene, it is revealed that the Volturi have been informed of Bella and Edward's wedding and Bella's transformation into a vampire . The new secretary, Bianca, is killed by Demetri and Felix for spelling Carlisle's name without an 's'. &quot;First it's the spelling, then the grammar,&quot; Aro claims. Marcus states that he, Aro, and Caius have no further business with the Cullens. However, Aro disagrees, saying the Cullens still have something he wants.\n[/i][/b]\n\n[b][color=blue][i]::Trackers::[/i][/color][/b]\n[b][code] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.ilibr.org:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.ilibr.org:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.token.ro:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.token.ro:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://the.illusionist.tracker.prq.to/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://the.illusionist.tracker.prq.to/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n[/code][/b]\n\n[b][color=red]Info Hash[/color]:[i]0F6F42B67BC78837019176E4F6EA64AF54EAF781[/i][/b] \n\n::ScreenShots::\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iThGGa46wLzEY.png[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iyXzMn9tYeK00.gif[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ibg1o6jMcgIhji.png[/img][/center]\n\nWe are now also on FaceBook.
