Its titles were mainly action/adventure, western, and horror. Its most notable character was Johnny Dynamite, created by Pete Morisi.\n\nWhen Comic Media became defunct, the company sold its titles and characters to Charlton Comics. Charlton then continued Dynamite as Johnny Dynamite, with work by Morisi, who continued to work for the company for many years. Johnny Dynamite would later be purchased by Max Allan Collins and Terry Beatty and reprinted in their Ms. Tree title and a miniseries they created.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Media&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Media&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAll True Romance: 2-3, 7, 9, 11-14, 16, 18-19\n\nDanger: 1-11 {Complete Series}\n\nDear Lonely Heart: 1\n\nDear Lonely Hearts: 2, 5-7\n\nDeath Valley: 1-6 {Complete Series}\n\nHorrific: 3-11\n\nTerrific: 14 {One-Shot}","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e668702218d66911aaf0de72880dbc0a7899e8a8","amp;dn":"Comic+Media+%7B1950-54+Golden+Age+Comic+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e668702218d66911aaf0de72880dbc0a7899e8a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,104,112,34,24,214,105,17,170,240,222,114,136,13,188,10,120,153,232,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
