Truly, information that is worth sharing with others.\n\nGive these thoughts consideration, no matter any preconcieved knowledge of this book.\n\nThere was a book published in 1967, &quot;Report from Iron Mountain&quot;.  This book is a template of our predicament today.  It is a very interesting book that literally foretold the future as Obama and company throws it at us.  For that very reason it is extremely relevant today, a must read.  The entire100 page book can be googled, read between the lines!\n\nRelevant in that it spoke of a scenario where a plausible, not necessarily true, just believable world wide environmental threat would be the basis to subject a populace to extreme and unwarranted taxes in order to keep them subject to the rule of government.  The book suggested that a credible threat to the planet would unite people, or more accurately motivate people to work to save the planet and do what ever was necessary to sustain life.  They would give of their money and their freedoms to save the planet.  The book was adamant that the key was to make the threat credible, that was the key. (Al Gore and the scientists embedded within the university system, credible?) \n\nThere is much more to the book, that has come to be as well.  Aliens and UFOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, (All the rage today, with the latest technologies focused on finding aliens) blood sports like the Ultimate fighters even come to play, etc..  Google ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReport from Iron MountainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the book is only a hundred or so pages long and I found extremely interesting, in that it so accurately reflects today, yet was written in 1967.  The template for conditioning the populace! \n\nThe book highlights a huge part of the SocialistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plan, as today they attempt to gain control, and in the future they will attempt to retain control through a one world peace keeping force.  Watch out for the outright confiscation of guns soon, this must occur as Americans will not go down easy, and there are plenty of Americans left, right?\n\nSave your condemnation until after you have read this book, hoax or true, need not matter actually.  The fact that this plan was laid out, published in 1967 for the world to see does not diminish if it was a hoax, indeed not at all.  The plan as written is in progress, this is undeniable.  It is not circumstance.\n\nBut imagine, it is true as stated, which is a very credible bet, and the reality is that, omg.
