I think of that dude everytime i see a Geiko commercial with the cavemen. He had no shirt and tattered shorts and no shoes.... After that Charlotte run, I was sold on touring from that point. Got to see them play 21 more times before it was all said and done. Fun show....Anyone remember the red OHM's that were as thick as cardboard at that show? Eat 1/2 of a square and you'd be out of your gourd. The party at Yogi's campground was even crazier than the show....fireworks going off everywhere, the filafel mafia getting hasseled and almost pulverized, the 100 person drum circles that spontaneously gathered, the crazy hippie crack women who jumped up on top of picnic tables pointing out who they were going to score with \nthat night (gulp!!!), and Yogi Bear riding around in a golf cart with a blue police light on the front. He came off the golf cart with 2 women holding him up and started dancing in the middle of the huge drum circle. Yes, it seemed there were a few thousand people tripping balls that night at the campground, but I swear to GOD that all this happened. I actually dropped my wallet that night and a brother saw it fall to the ground and brought it back to me.  Gotta love that type of &quot;family&quot; aspect at the shows and campgrounds.  It's as if it were yesterday.\n\nI'm rating it a 5 just for the sheer enjoyment of the entire experience, as well as the instrumental Dark Star and awesome Satisfaction (which had crazy effects going on Jerry's guitar...if you were there it sounded even trippier).\n\n\nReviewer: patkelleyPA - 4.00 out of 5 stars - November 28, 2008\nSubject: great Let It Grow. I'm a huge huge fan of this song and this one is crisp and tight and solid. The show is worth it for that song alone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5eb9b6349a2aad20eca9bf86e6ff4c086907d84","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1992-06-18+-+Charlotte+Coliseum+in+Charlotte%2C+NC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5eb9b6349a2aad20eca9bf86e6ff4c086907d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,235,155,99,73,162,170,210,14,202,155,248,110,111,244,192,134,144,125,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
