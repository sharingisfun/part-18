Blade, Whistler (Yes, he's back) and an armory expert named Scud are curiously summoned by the Shadow Council.

Blade's team and the Bloodpack are the only line of defense which can prevent the Reaper population from wiping out the vampire and human populations.\n\nMore movie info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187738/\n\nGenre....: Action | Fantasy | Horror\nActors:..: Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Ron Perlman\nSource...: Bluray\nContainer: Mp4\nVideo....: AVC x264 1280x720 2200kbps 23.976fs\nAudio....: English AC3 48KHz 6ch 384Kbps\nRuntime..: 01:56\nFilesize.: 2.11GB\nSubtitle.: English (.srt files)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlade 3 Trinity 2004\n\nStoryline:\nBlade finds himself alone surrounded by enemies, fighting an up hill battle with the vampire nation and now humans.
