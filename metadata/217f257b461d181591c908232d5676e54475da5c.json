His birth date is disputed, given as July 4, July 10, and July 23, in the years 1908, 1909, or 1910. He died on January 21, 1992.\n\nDupree's playing was almost all straight blues and boogie-woogie. He was not a sophisticated musician or singer, but he had a wry and clever way with words: &quot;Mama, move your false teeth, papa wanna scratch your gums.&quot; He sometimes sang as if he had a cleft palate and even recorded under the name Harelip Jack Dupree. This was an artistic conceit, as Dupree had excellent, clear articulation, particularly for a blues singer. Dupree would occasionally indulge in a vocalese style of sung word play, similar to Slim Gaillard's &quot;Vout&quot;, as for example in his &quot;All About Blues Feeling&quot;.\n\nHe sang about life, jail, drinking and drug addiction; although he himself was a light drinker and did not use other drugs. His &quot;Junker's Blues&quot; was also transmogrified by Fats Domino into his first hit, &quot;The Fat Man&quot;.[1] Dupree's songs included not only gloomy topics, such as &quot;TB Blues&quot; and &quot;Angola Blues&quot; (about Angola Prison, the infamous Louisiana prison farm), but also cheerful subjects like the &quot;Dupree Shake Dance&quot;: &quot;Come on, mama, on your hands and knees, do that shake dance as you please&quot;.\n\nOn his best known album, 1958's Blues from the Gutter for Atlantic, he was accompanied on guitar by Larry Dale, whose playing on that record inspired Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones. Dupree was also noted as a raconteur and transformed many of his stories into songs. &quot;Big Leg Emma's&quot; takes its place in the roots of rap music as the rhymed tale of a police raid on a barrelhouse. In later years he recorded with John Mayall, Mick Taylor and Eric Clapton.[1]\n\nAlthough Jerry Lee Lewis did not record Dupree's &quot;Shake Baby Shake&quot;, the lyrics in his version of &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On&quot; - &quot;You can shake it one time for me!&quot; - echo Dupree's song.\n\n--\nBlues from the Gutter\nAudio CD (September 15, 1992)\nOriginal Release Date: 1958\n\n  1.
