The approach taken presents a substantial and readable overview of the field and provides students with a tool of reference that will be valuable throughout their studies.\n\nThe volume is divided into two parts. The first is a set of eleven essays that approaches film history around the following themes:\n\n* History of the moving image\n\n* Film as art and popular culture\n\n* Production process\n\n* Evolution of sound\n\n* Alternative modes: experimental, documentary, animation\n\n* Cultural difference\n\n* FilmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationship to history\n\nThe second is a critical dictionary that explains concepts, summarizes debates in film studies, defines technical terms, describes major periods and movements, and discusses historical situations and the film industry. The volume as a whole is designed as an active system of cross-references: readers of the essays are referred to dictionary entries (and vice versa) and both provide short bibliographies that encourage readers to investigate topics.\n\n'This guide provides a stimulating insight into fifty directors working today' - Tanya Jones, The Media Education Association\n\n'The Routledge Companion to Film History has both breadth and enough depth to move beyond a more generalised and popularist approach to the topics within each chapter... An impressive addition to the film history 'library'.' - POV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6883900f4fe37f1e1f88b2fd8fc0b3ebaf78af77","amp;dn":"The+Routledge+Companion+to+Film+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6883900f4fe37f1e1f88b2fd8fc0b3ebaf78af77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,131,144,15,79,227,127,30,31,136,178,253,143,192,179,235,175,120,175,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
