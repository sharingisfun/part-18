The world is wrong. In \nSwitzerland, scientists working on the Large Hadron Collider \nhave discovered a new threat, a scientific anomaly capable of \ndestroying the earth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and only Rho Project technology can \nstop it. In exchange for a full pardon, Dr. Stephenson agrees \nto create a wormhole that will send the anomaly into deep \nspace.\n\nBut his promise masks the alien agenda that brought the \nRho Ship to earth. Now a trio of accidentally altered \nhumans must infiltrate StephensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wormhole project and \nstop it, no matter the cost. The final battle has begun \nand this is one battle mankind cannot afford to lose.\nUnabridged.\nRead by MacLeod Andrews.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7906fb153473f0f50d9b10e229c1e5778905dd0f","amp;dn":"Wormhole+%5BThe+Rho+Agenda%2C+Book+3%5D+-%C2%80%C2%93+Richard+Phillips","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7906fb153473f0f50d9b10e229c1e5778905dd0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,6,251,21,52,115,240,245,13,155,16,226,41,193,229,119,137,5,221,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
