Java &amp; XML shows how to use the APIs, tools, and tricks of XML to build real-world applications. The result is code and data that are portable. This second edition adds chapters on Advanced SAX and Advanced DOM, new chapters on SOAP and data binding, and new examples throughout. Following a concise introduction to XML basics, the rest of the book focuses on using XML from your Java applications. Java developers who need to work with XML, or think that they will in the future--as well as developers involved in the new peer-to-peer movement, messaging, or web services--will find Java &amp; XML a constant companion. Includes a quick reference on SAX 2.0, DOM Level 2, and JDOM.
