Long Time No See\n\n* Previously un-issued\n\nRecorded December 13-14, 1985 at The Power Station, New York\n\nThe exciting thing for me is to discover how these six pieces - which are included at the beginning of the new release - really complete the recording. They include two pieces (&quot;Police People&quot; and &quot;The Goof Life&quot;) where I contributed some more conventional blowing changes for us to play on for the improvised sections to go with Ornette&amp;#039;s great melodies - how rare and beautiful to hear Ornette play on structure like that - and three tunes that send the band into areas that were largely unrepresented in the original recording (&quot;Word From Bird&quot;,&quot;The Veil&quot; and &quot;Computer&quot;. The piece &quot;All Of Us&quot; functions mostly as a link.)\n- Pat Metheny May 2005\n\nPersonnel:\n\nPat Metheny: guitar, guitar synth\nOrnette Coleman: alto saxophone, violin on 8\nCharlie Haden: bass\nJack DeJohnette: drums\nDenard Coleman: drums, percussion\n\n\nSubido por \n&quot;Alrededor de Medianoche&quot;\nCiclo de jazz y blues que se emite por http://frecuenciavyp.com.ar cada lunes a las 21hs (Argentina).
