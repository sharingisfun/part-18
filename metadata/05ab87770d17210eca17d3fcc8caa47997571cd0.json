For his latest instrumental full-length, the forthcoming Ascent, Chasney has finally broken the habit, inviting his backing band Comets on Fire to record with him.\n\n&quot;Adopting the maxim Ã¢â‚¬Ëœif youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got it, flaunt it,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Six Organs of AdmittanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ben Chasny opens his latest album with a big, bold guitar solo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a whole five and a half minutes of virtuoso fret fiddling, all told. Track two mixes things up, kind of: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a five-minute guitar solo, but with a couple of extra minutes of moody psych preceding it.\n\nFor those who prefer such noodling as a means to an end (rather than the main attraction), both workouts are liable to outstay their welcome, but Chasny knows better than to let tedium take root, with Solar Ascent focusing his skills on a dirge-like slice of melancholia, and the acoustic melodies of Your Ghost delivering another well-timed pace-change. While Ascent is arguably less distinctive than recent discography highlights like the droning Luminous Night, its full-on rock elements serve to further subvert SOAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alt-folk origins, to striking effect.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ab87770d17210eca17d3fcc8caa47997571cd0","amp;dn":"Six+Organs+Of+Admittance+-+Ascent+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ab87770d17210eca17d3fcc8caa47997571cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,171,135,119,13,23,33,14,202,23,211,252,200,202,164,121,151,87,28,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
