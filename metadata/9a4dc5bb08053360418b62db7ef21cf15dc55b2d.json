By Ã¢â‚¬Å“translatingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ their ideas into everyday concepts like community empowerment and collective needs, these anarchists sparked the most dynamic American social movement in decades.\n\nIn Translating Anarchy Mark Bray provides unique insight into the inner workings and politics of OWS and its interactions with the press and the public. The book not only describes how OWS Ã¢â‚¬Å“strategically articulated our politicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the press and public, but provides an inside narrative of key OWS events; delineates the strands of anarchist and other thought that contributed to its political orientation; and draws lessons regarding key but controversial OWS approaches to the role of demands, the process of consensus, violence and non-violence, and other critical questions for future radical organizing. Straightforward and non-academic but in fact scholarly and historically informed,\nit provides an often witty good read. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the OWS phenomenon or who may ever interpret social movements\nfor the public and the media.\nJeremy Brecher, author of Strike! and Save the Humans?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a4dc5bb08053360418b62db7ef21cf15dc55b2d","amp;dn":"Translating+Anarchy.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a4dc5bb08053360418b62db7ef21cf15dc55b2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,77,197,187,8,5,51,96,65,139,98,219,126,242,28,241,93,197,91,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
