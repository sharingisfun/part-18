With Fever and Spear, Volume One of his unfolding novel Your Face Tomorrow, he returns us to the rarified world of Oxford (the delightful setting of All Souls and Dark Back of Time), while introducing us to territory entirely new--espionage.\n\n\n\nOur hero, Jaime Deza, separated from his wife in Madrid, is a bit adrift in London until his old friend Sir Peter WheelerÃ¢â‚¬â€retired Oxford don and semi-retired master spyÃ¢â‚¬â€recruits him for a new career in British Intelligence. Deza possesses a rare gift for seeing behind the masks people wear. He is soon observing interviews conducted by Her Majesty's secret service: variously shady international businessmen one day, would-be coup leaders the next. Seductively, this metaphysical thriller explores past, present, and future in the ever-more-perilous 21st century. This compelling and enigmatic tour de force from one of Europe's greatest writers continues with Volume Two, Dance and Dream.\n\nYour Face Tomorrow, Vol. 2: Dance and Dream (Your Face Tomorrow #2)\nby Javier MarÃƒÂ­as, Margaret Jull Costa (Translator)\n\nYour Face Tomorrow, Javier Marias's dazzling unfolding magnum opus, is a novel in three parts, which began with Volume One: Fever and Spear. Described as a &quot;brilliant dark novel&quot; (Scotland on Sunday), the book now takes a wild swerve in its new volume. Skillfully constructed around a central perplexing and mesmerizing scene in a nightclub, Volume Two: Dance and Dream again features Jacques Deza. In Volume One he was hired by MI6 as a person of extraordinarily sophisticated powers of perception. In Volume Two Deza discovers the dark side of his new employer when Tupra, his spy-master boss, brings out a sword and uses it in a way that appalls Deza: You can't just go around hurting and killing people like that. Why not? asks Tupra.\n\n\nSearching meditations on favors and jealousy, knowledge and the deep human desire not to know, violence and death play against memories of the Spanish Civil War as Deza's world becomes increasingly murky.\n\nYour Face Tomorrow, Vol. 3: Poison, Shadow, and Farewell (Your Face Tomorrow #3)\nby Javier MarÃƒÂ­as, Margaret Jull Costa (Translator)\n\nYour Face Tomorrow, Javier MarÃƒÂ­asÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daring novel in three parts culminates triumphantly in this much-anticipated final volume.\n\nPoison, Shadow, and Farewell, with its heightened tensions between meditations and noir narrative, with its wit and and ever deeper forays into the mysteries of consciousness, brings to a stunning finale MarÃƒÂ­asÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three-part Your Face Tomorrow. Already this novel has been acclaimed Ã¢â‚¬Å“exquisiteÃ¢â‚¬Å“ (Publishers Weekly), Ã¢â‚¬Å“gorgeousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Kirkus), and Ã¢â‚¬Å“outstanding: another work of urgent originalityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (London Independent). Poison, Shadow, and Farewell takes our hero Jaime DezaÃ¢â‚¬â€hired by MI6 as a person of extraordinarily sophisticated powers of perceptionÃ¢â‚¬â€back to Madrid to both spy on and try to protect his own family, and into new depths of love and loss, with a fluency on the subject of death that could make a stone weep.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:614e68e51cc6f75f0f3d7c31474e63eb59f79abd","amp;dn":"Your+Face+Tomorrow+Series+-+Javier+Maries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"614e68e51cc6f75f0f3d7c31474e63eb59f79abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,78,104,229,28,198,247,95,15,61,124,49,71,78,99,235,89,247,154,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
