Hotel owner Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) is a man of infinite rudeness with a rabid dislike of almost all guests\n\nFawlty Towers, a 22-room hotel located in Torquay, the centre of the 'English Riviera', is a den of mishap and disaster.\n\n Basil Fawlty, owner and manager of the hotel, is a man of infinite capability in impoliteness, caustic intolerance and general rudeness toward the guests he views as an unwelcome imposition. His wife, Sybil, is of a more practical demeanour, but seems to have an immunity to work. The running of the hotel is thus often left to waitress, maid, and all-round help Polly. Meanwhilse, Spanish waiter and porter Manuel is still struggling with English.\n\n[b]www.comedy.co.uk Review:[/b] One of, if not the, most well-loved British sitcom of all time, the importance and popularity of Fawlty Towers is difficult to exaggerate - particularly considering that only 12 episodes were ever made.\n\n The series managed to capture that magic formula of a familiar setting with absurb but believable characters, incredibly tight writing, wonderful performances from regulars and guest stars alike, and some of the most intricate storylines in light entertainment. Add in a liberal helping of superb one-liners, splendid set-piece visual treats, cracking dialogue and a sprinkling of slapstick, and you get this most popular and well-loved of series. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/fawlty_towers/characters/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/fawlty_towers/characters/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\n\nFawlty Towers - Series 01  (6x30min)\nFawlty Towers - Series 02  (6x30min)\n\n\nAudio (128k MP3)\nFawlty Towers - Series 01  (6x30min)\nFawlty Towers - Series 02  (6x30min)\n\n\n[/b]\n\n====================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Fawlty Towers.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 30mn 19s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 613 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 30mn 19s\nBitrate                     : 1 498 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.200\nStream size                 : 325 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 30mn 19s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 103 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 22.3 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 179 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:856400d4ae5c5c60d147c8a6463b4e9ef839444b","amp;dn":"Fawlty+Towers+-+S01+And+S02+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+And+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"856400d4ae5c5c60d147c8a6463b4e9ef839444b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,100,0,212,174,92,92,96,209,71,200,166,70,59,78,158,248,57,68,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
