So why, nearly forty years on, is the idea of a black rock &amp; roll band such an anomaly in pop&amp;#039;s social order, not to mention unspeakable on AOR radio? At a time when Jesse Jackson is confronting America with the serious possibility of a black man in the White House, what&amp;#039;s so improbable about a black rock band ÃƒÂ¢?? fueled by racial pride yet preaching the unity gospel, equally inspired by Led Zeppelin and George Clinton ÃƒÂ¢?? scoring in the white mainstream?\nWith Vivid, the improbable is now the inevitable. Living Colour, the all-black no-bullshit flagship band of New York&amp;#039;s Black Rock Coalition, has already wowed local rainbow crowds of Mohawks, metalheads and soul brethren with its fusion of buzz-saw punk, slam-dunk funk, avant-jazz frenzy and arena-rock waaaagh! It&amp;#039;s all wrapped up tight with the pop-hook savvy and barbed-wire fretwork of guitarist-songwriter Vernon Reid, and if nothing else, you can easily dig Vivid on a purely visceral level, thanks in no small part to the in-your-face fidelity of Ed Stasium&amp;#039;s production.\n&quot;Cult of Personality&quot; and &quot;Middle Man&quot; are right up Heavy Metal Blooze Street, Reid slicing and dicing riffs like some six-string Zorro. &quot;Glamour Boys,&quot; one of two dynamite pre-Epic demos produced by Mick Jagger and wisely included here, kicks like an ornery mule and sports a knockout chorus (&quot;I ain&amp;#039;t no glamour boy ÃƒÂ¢?? I&amp;#039;M FIERCE&quot;). And singer Corey Glover lights a Memphis R&amp;B bonfire under a brilliant reconstruction of Talking Heads&amp;#039; &quot;Memories Can&amp;#039;t Wait,&quot; torching David Byrne&amp;#039;s original nervous paranoia with a brooding soulful hurt stoked by Reid&amp;#039;s periodic guitar tantrums.\nBut Vivid isn&amp;#039;t just a call to rock. Rooted firmly in the black rock-and-rhetoric continuum of Sly Stone, late-Sixties James Brown and the Bad Brains, it&amp;#039;s also a call to accounts. &quot;Which Way to America?&quot; is a righteous demand for a fair slice of the American-dream pie. In &quot;Open Letter (to a Landlord),&quot; a power-rock protest against creeping gentrification and unchecked greed, Living Colour backs up its show of rage with chilling images of arson and blood money and a startlingly poignant chorus.\nIn its own way, Vivid is an open letter to rock &amp; roll itself, a demand for equal time and respect from a music that is Living Colour&amp;#039;s birthright. Vivid is too good to succeed in the white ÃƒÂ¢?? or black ÃƒÂ¢?? mainstream by virtue only of racial guilt, for kicking you at the base of your conscience. At its best, it combines the dance stance of classic Sly and P-Funk with a raw guitar frenzy born of both James Marshall Hendrix and James Blood Ulmer. But much of Vivid&amp;#039;s power comes from Living Colour&amp;#039;s direct address to the unspoken but very real problem of racism in modern rock &amp; roll (&quot;No, I&amp;#039;m not gonna rob you/No, I&amp;#039;m not gonna beat you/No, I&amp;#039;m not gonna rape you/So why you want to give me that funny vibe?&quot;). Vivid will not change the world single-handedly, but it&amp;#039;s a timely reminder of why it&amp;#039;s always worth trying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c1aaae50e4442a749bc98ad9249192db4f463e","amp;dn":"Living+Colour+-+Vivid+%281988-2002+Rem.%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c1aaae50e4442a749bc98ad9249192db4f463e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,193,170,174,80,228,68,42,116,155,201,138,217,36,145,146,219,79,70,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
