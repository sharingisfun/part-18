Since Headlights&amp;#039; formation in 2004, the band has toured virtually nonstop, playing over 300 shows in the past two and a half years in support of both its debut The Enemies EP and its stunning 2006 full-length Kill Them With Kindness.\nBased around Tristan Wraight&amp;#039;s acoustic guitar and Erin Fein&amp;#039;s keyboards, the songs on Some Racing, Some Stopping purposefully lack much of the spacey atmospherics that define the band&amp;#039;s earlier work. Instead the album is steeped in a classic pop sensibility, reminiscent of the &amp;#039;60s, Brill Building song craft, and Phil Spector production. Songs like the chiming, harmonic &quot;Catch Them All,&quot; the light and airy &quot;Cherry Tulips,&quot; the solemn &quot;January,&quot; and the driving, string-touched &quot;Market Girl&quot; are evidence of an album that is more focused than any of the band&amp;#039;s past work.\n\n01.
