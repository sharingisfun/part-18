The band&amp;#039;s lyrics expound upon the structure of the universe, potentiality, and freedom from the physical body. Engineered by Billy Anderson and produced by the band, Conference of the Birds progresses beyond their debut, Variations on a Theme, with more fully realized songwriting and production.&quot;\n\n\n\nThis is one of the most immaculate, hypnotic and powerful albums I have heard for many many many years. - David Tibet, Current 93\n\n\n\n\nPitchfork Review:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36681/Om_Conference_of_the_Birds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36681/Om_Conference_of_the_Birds&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRemember to seed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9fb0964eeeb337dea0c1d57530e9ee94af56eb","amp;dn":"OM+-+Conference+Of+The+Birds+-+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9fb0964eeeb337dea0c1d57530e9ee94af56eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,159,176,150,78,238,179,55,222,160,193,213,117,48,233,238,148,175,86,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
