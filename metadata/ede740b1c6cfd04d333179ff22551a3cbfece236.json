Not changing his approach (not that he should), though, means that his early records are still probably the ones to look for, and since this set takes key tracks (including his fun covers of John Lee Hooker's &quot;One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot; and Elmore James' &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;) from his first two albums, 1977's George Thorogood &amp; the Destroyers and 1978's Move It on Over, it makes a nice little sampler of where it all started -- and then stayed. ~ Steve Leggett\n\n\nTracklist\n1.
