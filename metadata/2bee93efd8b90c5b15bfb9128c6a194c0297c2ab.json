Gavotte II (1:50)\n02. Manha De Carnival (12:57)\n03. Triple Ballade (3:11)\n04. Memphis, Tennessee (9:44)\n05. Blend II (24:21)\n06. Gavotte II (1:58)\n\nOn his second and best album, Bull added more instruments and a bit of electricity. The centerpiece of the record is &quot;Blend II.&quot; Like &quot;Blend&quot; from his first album, it is a melange (somewhat more electric in tone) of folk, jazz, and the Middle East, this time 24 minutes' worth. Also included on this 54-minute LP are two versions (electric and acoustic) of a Bach passage, a composition from the 14th century (Guillaume de Machaut's &quot;Triple Ballade&quot;), and Luiz Bonfa's &quot;Manha de Carnival.&quot; A heavily reverbed (with drums), extended version of Chuck Berry's &quot;Memphis, Tennessee&quot; closes the set with an unexpected blast of rock &amp; roll. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bee93efd8b90c5b15bfb9128c6a194c0297c2ab","amp;dn":"Sandy+Bull+-+Inventions+%5B1964%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bee93efd8b90c5b15bfb9128c6a194c0297c2ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,238,147,239,216,185,12,91,21,191,185,18,140,106,25,76,2,151,194,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
