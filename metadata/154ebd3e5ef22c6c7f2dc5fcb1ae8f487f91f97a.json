The result is a beautiful mix of somber reflection, destination-unknown travelogue, and subversive anti-war boogie. Castanets&amp;#039; unrelenting creative pioneering delightfully befuddles, as they simultaneously flirt and dismantle &quot;New Americana&quot; venture capitalism.&quot;\n\nTrack List:\n\n   1.
