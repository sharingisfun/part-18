It ran for two series (of six episodes each) from July 2001 until July 2002.\n\nSet in East London, where Smith herself lived, A Brief History of Timewasting concerned the struggle of a single woman to fill the day, helped by her inept, sugar-loving, live-in builder Chris (Chris Neill), morbid elderly neighbour Betty (Margaret John), and Cab driver Worra (Femi Olufowuju Junior). Supporting roles were played by Jeremy Hardy and Martin Hyder.\n\nSmith's playing to her audience led to many familiar voices from Radio 4, including then-chief announcer Peter Donaldson, Thought for the Day regular Rabbi Lionel Blue, and Woman's Hour stalwart Jenni Murray, appearing as themselves.\n\n\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S01 - E01 - The Carpet Sweeper\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S01 - E02 - East End Mafia\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S01 - E03 - Opera Gas And Gardening\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S01 - E04 - A Day Trip To Romney Marsh\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S01 - E05 - Coffins, Funerals And Nursing Homes\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S01 - E06 - 999 Emergency\n\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S02 - E01 - Fragile Peace\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S02 - E02 - Poltergeist\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S02 - E03 - Museum Of East End Life\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S02 - E04 - New Islington\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S02 - E05 - Neighbourhood Watch\nLinda Smith's A Brief History Of Timewasting - S02 - E06 - The End Of Timewasting\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 0s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:189f92f74e1fc8228159e4e9137bbc3a59627826","amp;dn":"Linda+Smiths+-+A+Brief+History+Of+Timewasting+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"189f92f74e1fc8228159e4e9137bbc3a59627826","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,159,146,247,78,31,200,34,129,89,228,233,19,123,188,58,89,98,120,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
