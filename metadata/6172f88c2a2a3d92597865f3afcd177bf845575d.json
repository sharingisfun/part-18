It has since been followed by over two dozen additional books, including The Eyes of the Sphinx, Odyssey of the Gods, and The Gods Were Astronauts. Born and educated in Switzerland, Erich is an active researcher and explorer. His books have given rise to two full-length documentary films, Chariots of the Gods and Messages of the Gods, and he has delivered over 3,000 lectures in twenty-five countries. He lives in Beatenberg, Switzerland, with his wife. \n\nThe Ancient astronauts or ancient aliens[1] theory is a pseudo-scientific proposal that posits intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistory. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of human cultures, technologies, and religions. A common claim is that deities from most, if not all, religions are actually extraterrestrial in nature, and that such visitors' advanced technologies were wrongly understood by primitive men as evidence of divine status.[2][3]\n\nProposers subscribing to the resultant paleocontact hypothesis proposal have popularized, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century, include Erich von DÃƒÂ¤niken, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert K. G. Temple, David Icke, and Peter Kolosimo,[4] but the idea that ancient astronauts actually existed is not taken seriously by academics, and has received little or no credible attention in peer reviewed studies.[5] Ancient astronauts have been widely used as a plot device in science fiction.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_D%C3%A4niken&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_D%C3%A4niken&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6172f88c2a2a3d92597865f3afcd177bf845575d","amp;dn":"Erich+von+Daniken+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6172f88c2a2a3d92597865f3afcd177bf845575d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,114,248,140,42,42,61,146,89,120,101,243,175,205,23,123,248,69,87,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
