To look at the sexy -- and risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© for 1962 -- cover, one would think that half of the tunes, stately renditions of gospel songs, wouldn't be at home on the album. But considering that the ribald, innuendo-laden first side is belied by White's silky voice and mellifluous guitar, he almost makes the juke-joint rave-ups sound like show tunes. Given his role as elder statesmen of acoustic blues, you'd be forgiven for thinking that White didn't need to be rediscovered as such, but sadly he did. Although considering this album, &quot;reinvented&quot; might be a better word. From the man who popularized &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; -- perhaps the saddest, most poignant protest song ever -- one wouldn't necessarily expect such explicit sex songs. Whether it's a tune like the title track or &quot;Backwater Blues,&quot; White reaches back to the lowdown, alpha-male origins of the blues, but comes off a little too much like a cabaret entertainer. His playing retains the delicate precision that found him oft-imitated, and the backing, mostly by just Bill Lee on upright bass, is always tasteful. Still, it's a mellow set, and one partly done with a wink -- considering it was among the last albums that White made before he died. It seems too minstrely of an end for someone who's scope and influence on modern blues can't be overstated. ~ Alex Stimmel\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Empty Bed Blues  3:21 \n2 Mother on That Train  3:45 \n3 Bottle Up and Go  2:27 \n4 Backwater Blues  5:52 \n5 Baby Baby Blues  5:32 \n6 Lord Have Mercy 4:02 \n7 Home In that Rock  2:\n8 Paul and Silas  2:34 \n9 His Eye Is on the Sparrow  5:25 \n10 That Suits Me  2:49\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:897e88bcaf60bfe695866e9f2a871f25d9d1e476","amp;dn":"Josh+White+Empty+Bed+Blues%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"897e88bcaf60bfe695866e9f2a871f25d9d1e476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,126,136,188,175,96,191,230,149,134,110,159,42,135,31,37,217,209,228,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
