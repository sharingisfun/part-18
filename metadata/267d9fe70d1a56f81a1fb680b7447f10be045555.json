The original project is not only musical, but also cinematographic. In theory it should tell the story of a woman who crosses different lives over the years and centuries, although the final cut was edited per request of Lara Fabian herself, destroying the original time-sequence of the movie, and transforming it into a series of videoclips.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:267d9fe70d1a56f81a1fb680b7447f10be045555","amp;dn":"%27Mademoiselle+Zhivago%27+Movie+%5B2013%5D+WEBRip+%28Lara+Fabian%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"267d9fe70d1a56f81a1fb680b7447f10be045555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,125,159,231,13,26,86,248,26,31,182,128,183,68,127,16,190,4,85,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
