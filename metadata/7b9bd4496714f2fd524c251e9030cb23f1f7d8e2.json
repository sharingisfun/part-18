The great tenor interacts engagingly with trumpeter Arnved Meyer's mainstream quintet, with the resulting music sometimes a bit reminiscent of Duke Ellington's small-group recordings of the 1930s. In addition to his warm versions of &quot;Nancy with the Laughing Face,&quot; &quot;My Romance&quot; and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses,&quot; it is a pleasure to hear Webster romping on &quot;Stompy Jones&quot; and &quot;The Jeep Is Jumping&quot; over 20 years after he originally left Ellington's band.
