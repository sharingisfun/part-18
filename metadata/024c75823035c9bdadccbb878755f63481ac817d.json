It's full co-operative\n\nharmonizing.  When these two play unison lines it's like a flanger or chorus\n\ngenerator has been switched on....their tones are that similar with Lester Young's\n\nsound and choice of notes.  This is not hard bop...more like swing bop\n\n\nThis is textbook West Coast Jazz sound..heavy on the ballad content\n\n\nIf you like Getz or early Zoot your ears will be happy.
