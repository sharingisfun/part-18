The original boot wasn't well edited, but\nwith the changes above, it is now truly great. Neil's guitar is better recorded and more\nto the foreground than most so if you like that...\n\n...Don't miss it !!\n\nNeil Young: Guitar, Keyboards, Banjo, Harmonica, Vocals\nFrank Sampedro: Guitar, Keyboadrs, Vocals\nBilly Talbot: Bass, Vocals\nRalph Molina: Drums, Vocals\n\nDisk1 Early Show (solo)\n---------------------------\n05.37 The Old Laughing Lady\n03.51 Human Highway\n03.36 Journey Through The Past\n03.44 Pocahontas\n02.40 The Needle And The Damage Done\n03.52 Give Me Strength\n05.19 A Man Needs A Maid\n05.36 Sugar Mountain\n\nDisk2 Early Show (electric)\n-------------------------------\n06.20 Country Home\n02.38 Don't Cry No Tears\n09.38 Down By The River\n03.15 Lotta Love\n10.58 Like A Hurricane\n04.35 After The Goldrush\n08.34 Cortez The Killer\n08.28 Cinnamon Girl\n05.08 Are You Ready For The Country ?\n\nDisk3 Late Show (solo)\n--------------------------\n04.04 Tell Me Why\n02.51 Roll Another Number\n03.38 Journey Through The Past\n02.21 The Needle And The Damage Done\n02.59 Harvest\n03.47 Campaigner\n03.37 Pocahontas\n04.29 A Man Needs A Maid\n06.52 Sugar Mountain\n\nDisk4 Late Show (electric)\n------------------------------\n05.21 Country Home\n03.06 Don't Cry No Tears\n04.02 Drive Back\n09.42 Cowgirl In The Sand\n04.36 Bite The Bullet\n03.17 Lotta Love\n10.25 Like A Hurricane\n04.14 After The Goldrush\n04.13 Are You Ready For The Country ?\n06.38 Cortez The Killer\n05.20 Cinnamon Girl\n02.53 Homegrown\n06.23 Southern Man","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f166a3b74434584a63d8ccdea324db044a744472","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+and+Crazy+Horse+-+Boston+Music+Hall%2C+Boston%2C+MA+11-22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f166a3b74434584a63d8ccdea324db044a744472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,102,163,183,68,52,88,74,99,216,204,222,163,36,219,4,74,116,68,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
