I haven't watched it since '82 or '83 I think. I can still hear Ali say 'a thousand apologies', or is it Ranjeet? I was so young then. My favourite episode is the one when the students were expecting the Queen and unknowingly welcomed her look-alike, who actually came to see her husband in the wood-work class!\n9 Linda from Newcastle Upon Tyne: I'll never forget Miss Courtney and Mr Brown and all the students ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ still see some of them pop up on tv at times. Fond memories!!!\n8 Karen from Sheffield: As i was born in the 80's i never saw Mind Your Language when it was originally aired. But one Sunday morning when it was on my Mum told me it was good so I watched it and whenever it is on.\n7 Kyoko Ideguchi from Japan (now in London): I like Mind Your Language very much! I used to watch Mind Your Language in Japan. Now I am in London and I am looking for an English school and a teacher like Mr. Brown.\n6 Biniam Bililign from USA: This show is my favirote show of all times. I remember every detail of the show watching it while I was growing up in ethiopia.\n5 Allen Reavie from N Ireland: I used to watch MYL years ago on a Saturday evening with my parents. Whilst I am probably too young to remember it all, I thought the titles and theme music was great.\n4 Adrian from Australia: I used to love watching Mind Your Language when I was a kid, it's one of the funniest shows that I remember from my childhood days. My favourite character was Ali. What a fantastic show, now I tape every episode to keep forever.\n3 Craig from Australia: Mind Your Language is THE best show ever on telly bar none!\nEspecially, the performance of Barry Evans as Mr Brown &amp; the funniest bloke in the show is Juam!!\n2 John from Bath: Mind Your Language is a true classic which I enjoyed during my childhood. Are there any good links to what happened to the cast of this sitcom? Please publish them on this website if they exist. Thanks!!\n1 Steven Evans from Kent: I love this programme because it was on when i was still young and at school and brings back some great memories and tv programmes are not made like this one anymore!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6464d5d236ed0b29f6eda24521b45b1c7e6e66d9","amp;dn":"Mind+your+language+1977+UK+comedy+series+mobile+avi+with+eng+sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6464d5d236ed0b29f6eda24521b45b1c7e6e66d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,100,213,210,54,237,11,41,246,237,162,69,33,180,91,28,126,110,102,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
