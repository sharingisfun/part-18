In the appetizer round, the competition tries not to choke on processed cheese and baked beans. The entrÃƒÂ©e forces them to sharpen their skills with razor clams and hickory sticks. Another family favourite makes an appearance in the dessert round, finding one chef right in his comfort zone.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 16-Jan-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f5939adad392b02aa9fa8784c77dd0c7ff8c1a","amp;dn":"Chopped.Canada.S01E03.Food.Sweat.and.Tears.HDTV.x264-CBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f5939adad392b02aa9fa8784c77dd0c7ff8c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,245,147,154,218,211,146,176,42,169,250,135,132,199,125,208,199,255,140,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
