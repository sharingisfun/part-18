When a seemingly harmless local man offers her a ride to the bus station, In-jeong thinks she\\\\\\'s been saved - until he insists that they stop to meet his friends, a disturbed group of country-bred thugs. In-jeong finds herself reunited with Yeong-sun and it slowly becomes clear that the pair is being held captive to participate in the gang\\\\\\'s sadistic mind games.
