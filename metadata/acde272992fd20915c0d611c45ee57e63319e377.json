This development has made it possible to take long forgotten, badly damaged photos and make them new again with image estimation. This fully revised and expanded second edition, will give you the necessary understanding of image and video processing concepts to contribute to this hot technology's future advances. Important new topics include introductory random processes, image enhancement and analysis, and the new MPEG scalable video coding standard.\nOnly R&amp;D level tutorial that gives an integrated treatment of image and video processing - topics that are interconnected.\nNew chapters on introductory random processes, information theory, and image enhancement and analysis\nCoverage and discussion of the latest standards in video coding: H.264/AVC and the new scalable video standard (SVC)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acde272992fd20915c0d611c45ee57e63319e377","amp;dn":"Multidimensional+Signal%2C+Image%2C+and+Video+Processing+and+Coding","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acde272992fd20915c0d611c45ee57e63319e377","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,222,39,41,146,253,32,145,92,13,97,28,69,238,87,230,51,25,227,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
