Noble, &quot;Forces of Production: A Social History of Industrial Automation&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 1412818281 | 2011 | EPUB | 427 pages | 3,1 MB\n\nFocusing on the design and implementation of computer-based automatic machine tools, David F. Noble challenges the idea that technology has a life of its own. Technology has been both a convenient scapegoat and a universal solution, serving to disarm critics, divert attention, depoliticize debate, and dismiss discussion of the fundamental antagonisms and inequalities that continue to beset America. This provocative study of the postwar automation of the American metal-working industryÃ¢â‚¬â€the heart of a modern industrial economyÃ¢â‚¬â€explains how dominant institutions like the great corporations, the universities, and the military, along with the ideology of modern engineering shape, the development of technology.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f573bb0483400a0ae814f5567a0b0fbf872d25","amp;dn":"Forces+of+Production%3A+A+Social+History+of+Industrial+Automation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f573bb0483400a0ae814f5567a0b0fbf872d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,245,115,187,4,131,64,10,10,232,20,245,86,122,11,15,191,135,45,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
