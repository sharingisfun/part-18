Also, there is one track from The Tide and Its Takers that I could not get a FLAC copy of (track 6, Only A Year or So...). That track is encoded in .mp3, LAME 3.97, VBR -V 2 (Standard). Other than that, all other tracks are FLAC. Please seed, and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ab6f99fceb0b7d2c1c3fed77918cd5cd1c54099","amp;dn":"36+Crazyfists+Studio+Albums+Discography+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ab6f99fceb0b7d2c1c3fed77918cd5cd1c54099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,182,249,159,206,176,183,210,193,195,254,215,121,24,205,92,209,197,64,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
