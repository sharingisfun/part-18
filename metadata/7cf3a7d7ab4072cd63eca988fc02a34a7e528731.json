Social scientists and other thinkers struggle to explain it, but the puzzle remainsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in part because they, too, disagree so much with one another. Whether the arena is politics, religion, business, scientific research, or education, individuals who operate in the same environment and experience the same conditions may have radically different interpretations of the facts and diametrically opposed convictions about how to react to them. When faced with a fundamental disagreement, we ask ourselves: Why are these folks so wrong? And how can they be so convinced that we are wrong? \n\nIn this provocative monograph, Tibor Machan explores the principles of truth, reason, and ideology, with particular respect to the profound political, economic, and social crises gripping the world today. In so doing, he not only sheds light on the nature of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtruthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but also suggests a framework for embracing differences to come up with creative solutions.\n\nJanuary 2011\nPublisher: Springer\nFormat: Paperback 44pp\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cf3a7d7ab4072cd63eca988fc02a34a7e528731","amp;dn":"Why+Is+Everyone+Else+Wrong%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cf3a7d7ab4072cd63eca988fc02a34a7e528731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,243,167,215,171,64,114,205,99,236,169,136,252,2,163,74,126,82,135,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
