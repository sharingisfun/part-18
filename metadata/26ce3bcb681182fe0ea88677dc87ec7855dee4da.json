Artists such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, and Metallica, among others, have been covered with varying degrees of success. The challenge for Christopher O&amp;#039;Riley is not simply concocting classical stylizations of Radiohead&amp;#039;s music, but translating the group&amp;#039;s powerfully distinctive sound into transcriptions for solo piano. The good news is that O&amp;#039;Riley succeeds in conveying the scope of the band&amp;#039;s richly textured sonic assault with virtuosic arrangements that do justice to its unique musical perspective. His evocative arrangements of songs such as &quot;Knives Out,&quot; &quot;Karma Police,&quot; and &quot;Let Down&quot; bring their intriguing melodies and harmonies into sharp focus while still retaining the mood of the originals. It&amp;#039;s a testament to O&amp;#039;Riley&amp;#039;s abilities that he&amp;#039;s able to communicate Thom Yorke&amp;#039;s singular vocal style through the keyboard, most notably in &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; and &quot;Exit Music (For A Film).&quot; He also deals effectively with the tunes that are built around the band&amp;#039;s triple guitar onslaught. In &quot;Airbag,&quot; for example, the powerful riff that drives the song takes on a Lisztian majesty in O&amp;#039;Riley&amp;#039;s hands. Familiarity with Radiohead&amp;#039;s music is not a prerequisite to enjoy this excellent disc. It will appeal to anyone who appreciates superlative musicianship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ce3bcb681182fe0ea88677dc87ec7855dee4da","amp;dn":"True+Love+Waits+-+Christopher+O%5C%27Riley+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ce3bcb681182fe0ea88677dc87ec7855dee4da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,206,59,203,104,17,130,254,14,168,134,119,220,135,236,120,85,222,228,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
