The title is \n\nin reference not to an actual soundtrack but \n\nrather the soundtrack to Aaron Funk's \n\n&quot;downfall&quot;. It is said to be a follow-up to the \n\n2005 album Rossz csillag alatt szÃƒÂ¼letett, as \n\nhinted by the reappearing Hungarian song titles. \n\nAaron was quoted as saying, &quot;This album has \n\nnothing to do with dubstep and very little to do \n\nwith breakcore.&quot; It, like the album it is said \n\nto follow, consists largely of classical \n\ncompositions. However, unlike said album, it \n\nfeatures very little in the way of drumbeats, \n\ninstead focusing on an atmospheric sound made by \n\nthe classical instruments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c964617850855e4b04fd8e1b617dcc303a6e3042","amp;dn":"My+Downfall+%28OST%29+-+Venetian+Snares+%5B2007%5D+-+Lossless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c964617850855e4b04fd8e1b617dcc303a6e3042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,100,97,120,80,133,94,75,4,253,142,27,97,125,204,48,58,110,48,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
