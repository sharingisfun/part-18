Numerous tasks in computer science can be formulated in game-theoretic terms. This fresh and intuitive way of thinking through complex issues reveals underlying algorithmic questions and clarifies the relationships between different domains. This collection of lectures, by specialists in the field, provides an excellent introduction to various aspects of game theory relevant for applications in computer science that concern program design, synthesis, verification, testing and design of multi-agent or distributed systems. Originally devised for a Spring School organised by the GAMES Networking Programme in 2009, these lectures have since been revised and expanded, and range from tutorials concerning fundamental notions and methods to more advanced presentations of current research topics. This volume is a valuable guide to current research on game-based methods in computer science for undergraduate and graduate students. It will also interest researchers working in mathematical logic, computer science and game theory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d453de1c075981582d40b7dd6696ad4145e6eced","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Lectures+in+Game+Theory+for+Computer+Scientists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d453de1c075981582d40b7dd6696ad4145e6eced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,83,222,28,7,89,129,88,45,64,183,221,102,150,173,65,69,230,236,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
