Records. While What Hits!? encompassed material from their 1984 debut to 1989&amp;#039;s Mother&amp;#039;s Milk, this collection of songs takes off from that point, including material from the 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik up to 2002&amp;#039;s By the Way. It was during this period of their career that the band became a major commercial force in the music industry. Therefore this compilation includes the majority of hit singles released since their breakthrough cover of Stevie Wonder&amp;#039;s &quot;Higher Ground&quot; (also included on What Hits!?).\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers: Anthony Kiedis (vocals); John Frusciante (guitar); Flea (bass); Chad Smith (drums). Compilation producers: Rick Rubin, Michael Beinhorn. Although the Red Hot Chili Peppers have received the hits treatment before (most notably on 1992&amp;#039;s WHAT HITS?), this compilation serves to highlight the band&amp;#039;s peak years with guitarist John Frusciante, both before his sudden departure in 1992 and after his lauded return for 1999&amp;#039;s CALIFORNICATION. (The group&amp;#039;s intriguing-yet-mismatched union with Jane&amp;#039;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro yields only one track, &quot;My Friends.&quot;)\n\nThe Chili Peppers are best known for their energetic punk-funk anthems but their mainstream breakthrough, the gently building ballad &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; opens GREATEST HITS. It&amp;#039;s followed in short order, however by the boisterous, slaphappy &quot;Give It Away.&quot; Other Peppers high points include the beautifully melancholy &quot;Scar Tissue,&quot; the hard-to-find &quot;Soul to Squeeze,&quot; the folky &quot;Breaking the Girl,&quot; and the only pre-1990s track--the group&amp;#039;s wonderfully rocked-out cover of Stevie Wonder&amp;#039;s &quot;Higher Ground.&quot; Of course, this HITS collection includes the seemingly requisite (and quite good) two new tracks--the driving &quot;Fortune Faded&quot; and the dreamy &quot;Save the Population.&quot; GREATEST HITS effectively chronicles the Peppers&amp;#039; transition from goofy party boys to mature, highly inventive rock band.\n\nReleased November 18, 2003 \nRecorded 1989-2003 \nGenre Rock \nLength 67:19 \nLabel Warner Bros. \nProducer(s) Rick Rubin\nMichael Beinhorn (Track 12 only) \n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Flea/Frusciante/Kiedis/Smith\nExcept Track 11, written by Flea/Kiedis/Navarro/Smith\nAnd Track 12 written by Stevie Wonder\n\n&quot;Under the Bridge&quot; ? 4:35 (from the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik) \n&quot;Give It Away&quot; ? 4:47 (from the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik) \n&quot;Californication&quot; ? 5:32 (from the album Californication) \n&quot;Scar Tissue&quot; ? 3:38 (from the album Californication) \n&quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot; ? 4:52 (from the soundtrack to Coneheads) \n&quot;Otherside&quot; ? 4:17 (from the album Californication) \n&quot;Suck My Kiss&quot; ? 3:38 (from the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik) \n&quot;By the Way&quot; ? 3:38 (from the album By the Way) \n&quot;Parallel Universe&quot; ? 4:31 (from the album Californication) \n&quot;Breaking the Girl&quot; ? 4:57 (from the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik) \n&quot;My Friends&quot; ? 4:11 (from the album One Hot Minute) \n&quot;Higher Ground&quot; ? 3:24 (from the album Mother&amp;#039;s Milk) \n&quot;Universally Speaking&quot; ? 4:19 (from the album By the Way) \n&quot;Road Trippin&amp;#039;&quot; ? 3:28 (from the album Californication) \n&quot;Fortune Faded&quot; ? 3:23 (Previously Unreleased) \n&quot;Save the Population&quot; ? 4:07 (Previously Unreleased) \n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b210b801e1d9b448cf261674b3e145692456c992","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+Greatest+Hits+-+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b210b801e1d9b448cf261674b3e145692456c992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,16,184,1,225,217,180,72,207,38,22,116,179,225,69,105,36,86,201,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
