Awaiting you is a vast\nlandscape filled with wildlife, edible plants, and the memories of our\nnow-dead culture stored in artefacts such as journals, sketchbooks,\nnewspapers, zines, brochures, transcripts, blogs, and more. Collect\nthese memories and piece together what happened to these people.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOver 150 documents telling the interconnected stories of dozens of\ncharacters across hundreds of years.\n\nAn enormous, hand-sculpted Western Washington that takes multiple hours\nto cross.\n\nDay/night cycle and dynamic weather.\n\nVaried flora and fauna (both predators and prey).\n\n\n   INSTALL NOTES\n\n\n1.
