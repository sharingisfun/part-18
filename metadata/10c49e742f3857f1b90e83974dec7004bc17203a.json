The trio features tenor and alto saxophonist Petr Cancura\nand longtime Morris collaborator Luther Gray on drums; their interaction is\nblustery and energetic, filled with the fire of free jazz as practiced by\nCharles Gayle, Peter BrÃƒÂ¶tzmann, and other modern-day followers in the footsteps\nof Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, and Pharoah Sanders. There's a lot of Ayler in\nCancura's tone; he's a powerful player with a strong sense of melody, always\nretaining an essential cohesion within his solos, even at their most\nfervid. Gray is all over the kit, guiding the other two men and maintaining a\nforceful momentum; he both introduces and concludes &quot;Geomantic&quot; with solos that\nrecall Max Roach in their use of toms and ability to make the drums seem to\nsing. Morris' bass playing is as fascinating as ever. He begins &quot;Thicket&quot; with\nan assault on the strings that's reminiscent of the guimbri, a gut-stringed\ninstrument played by the Gnawa tribes of North Africa. Cancura picks up the\nhint and solos in a manner that echoes Pharoah Sanders' work with the Gnawa on\nhis Trance of the Seven Colors album. The third track, &quot;Crow,&quot; is a bluesy\nballad on which Cancura sounds like his tongue has swelled to twice its normal\nthickness, and the upbeat &quot;Nettle,&quot; which closes the disc, features an\nastonishing, extended Morris solo as well as a fiery crescendo before things\ndraw to a meditative conclusion. This album is a masterful showcase for three\nbrilliant musicians.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c49e742f3857f1b90e83974dec7004bc17203a","amp;dn":"Joe+Morris+-+Wildlife+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c49e742f3857f1b90e83974dec7004bc17203a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,196,158,116,47,56,87,241,185,14,131,151,77,236,112,4,188,23,32,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
