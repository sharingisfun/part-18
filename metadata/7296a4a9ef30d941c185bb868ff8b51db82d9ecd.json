Since 1959, conflict and aggression have dominated the story of U.S.-Cuban relations. Now, William M. LeoGrande and Peter Kornbluh present a new and increasingly more relevant account. From John F. Kennedy's offering of an olive branch to Fidel Castro after the missile crisis, to Henry Kissinger's top secret quest for normalization, to Barack Obama's promise of a &quot;new approach,&quot; LeoGrande and Kornbluh reveal a fifty-year record of dialogue and negotiations, both open and furtive, indicating a path toward better relations in the future.\n\nLeoGrande and Kornbluh have uncovered hundreds of formerly secret U.S. documents and conducted interviews with dozens of negotiators, intermediaries, and policy makers, including Fidel Castro and Jimmy Carter. The authors describe how, despite the political clamor surrounding any hint of better relations with Havana, serious negotiations have been conducted by every presidential administration since Eisenhower's through secret, back-channel diplomacy. Concluding with ten lessons for U.S. negotiators, the book offers an important perspective on current political debates, at a time when leaders of both nations have publicly declared the urgency of moving beyond the legacy of hostility.\n\nPublisher: The University of North Carolina Press; 1 edition (1 October 2014)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00N5YYUEK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7296a4a9ef30d941c185bb868ff8b51db82d9ecd","amp;dn":"%5BWilliam+M.+LeoGrande+%2CPeter+Kornbluh%5DBack+Channel+to+Cuba+The+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7296a4a9ef30d941c185bb868ff8b51db82d9ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,150,164,169,239,48,217,65,193,133,187,134,143,248,181,29,184,45,158,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
