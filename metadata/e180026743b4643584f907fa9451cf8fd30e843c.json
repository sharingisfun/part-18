The first single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Feel AliveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ preceded the full-length disc in September 2011, and the accompanying video became an Internet sensation.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Everything Is ChangingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was recorded mainly at her home studio in the Netherlands and at Ultrasound Studios, Braga (PT) with production done by Daniel Cardoso. This album is the first one to be released under her own name and promises to reveal an entirely new side of this multi-talented singer.\n\nAnneke describes the creative process surrounding the album as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfinding my own identity as a solo artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. It reflects the changes sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been going through in recent years, resulting in a unique blend of upbeat rock, electronic sounds and of course Van GiersbergenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark heartfelt singing style.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/25/anneke-van-giersbergen/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/25/anneke-van-giersbergen/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e180026743b4643584f907fa9451cf8fd30e843c","amp;dn":"Anneke+van+Giersbergen...Everything+Is+Changing%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e180026743b4643584f907fa9451cf8fd30e843c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,128,2,103,67,180,100,53,132,249,7,250,148,81,207,143,211,14,132,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
