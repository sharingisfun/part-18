In this new fifth edition, D.S. Malik continues to employ his student-focused, example-based methodology to teach C++ Programming to introductory computing students. Changes to this edition include new debugging sections in each chapter and a multitude of new and updated exercises. All syntax is explained thoroughly and reinforced through extensive examples and diagrams, and each chapter is full of helpful self-study tools such as complete programming examples. C++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures will motivate to students to understand the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhy?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ behind key C++ concepts.\n\nIntended for a two-semester CS1/CS2 sequence, beginning with introductory topics and moving into data structures later in the text.\nProgramming examples accurately outline the concrete stages of Input, Output, Problem Analysis, and Algorithm Design, and include a Complete Program Listing.\nA full-color interior displays precise C++ code and comments.\nMore than 300 visual diagrams illuminate difficult concepts.\nNumbered examples throughout every chapter illustrate key topics with their relevant code, and are followed by a Sample Run and explanation.\nTable of Contents\n1.
