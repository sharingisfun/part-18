One of the leading American stage actors of his \ngeneration, now in his sixties, he has lost his magic, his talent, and \nhis assurance. His Falstaff and Peer Gynt and Vanya, all his great \nroles, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œare melted into air, into thin air.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ When he goes onstage he \nfeels like a lunatic and looks like an idiot. His confidence in his \npowers has drained away; he imagines people laughing at him; he can no \nlonger pretend to be someone else. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomething fundamental has vanished.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nHis wife has gone, his audience has left him, his agent canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t persuade \nhim to make a comeback. \n\nInto this shattering account of inexplicable and terrifying \nself-evacuation bursts a counterplot of unusual erotic desire, a \nconsolation for a bereft life so risky and aberrant that it points not \ntoward comfort and gratification but to a yet darker and more shocking \nend. In this long day's journey into night, told with Roth's inimitable \nurgency, bravura, and gravity, all the ways that we convince ourselves \nof our solidity, all our lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performances -- talent, love, sex, hope, \nenergy, reputation -- are stripped off. Following the dark meditations \non mortality and endings in Everyman and Exit Ghost, and the bitterly \nironic retrospect on youth and chance in Indignation, Roth has written \nanother in his haunting group of late novels.   \nThe Humbling is Roth's 30th book.\n - - -\n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n&gt;&gt;The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb9128e0d4eda9832cd24de45fcf42fa2eaba045","amp;dn":"THE+HUMBLING+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+Dick+Hill+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb9128e0d4eda9832cd24de45fcf42fa2eaba045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,145,40,224,212,237,169,131,44,210,77,228,95,207,66,250,46,171,160,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
