Of course, Tom tries to romance Gusto; but though she likes him, her career comes first, and Tom himself prefers freedom-fighting to settling down. Comedy becomes drama as their mixed feelings lead them on a circuitous path through the deepening chaos and catastrophe of the early days of World War II.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29a1a62fd3ac52a7680886dfa907ce3736d13cc1","amp;dn":"Arise+My+Love+-+1940","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29a1a62fd3ac52a7680886dfa907ce3736d13cc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,161,166,47,211,172,82,167,104,8,134,223,169,7,206,55,54,209,60,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
