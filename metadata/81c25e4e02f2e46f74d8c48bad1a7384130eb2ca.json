But the hyper-real route that the film takes to arrive there, before veering into a zone of dangerous emotional play, contributes to a disorienting, adventurous, and ultimately tremendously exciting experience unlike any ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“police-thrillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ever before conceived.\n\nThe iconic GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Depardieu (who also collaborated with Pialat on Loulou, Sous le soleil de Satan, and Le GarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§u) plays Mangin, a cop whose brutal method of investigation finds its obsessive outlet in an attempt to crack a Tunisian narcotics ring. It is when Mangin enters into close acquaintance with the defiant Noria (expertly played by Sophie Marceau in one of her first screen roles) that the film proceeds to chart an unexpected, emotionally ambiguous course ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the lines between ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“rightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“wrongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“powerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“freedomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, terminally blur.\n\nWritten with Catherine Breillat, but relying in equal measure upon PialatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s improvisatory control (directing, among others, his star-actress from A nos amours, Sandrine Bonnaire), Police is a genre-defying excursion in the pantheon of cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most idiosyncratic thrillers.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/vlcsnap-3438583.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/vlcsnap-3438583.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/vlcsnap-3441352.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/vlcsnap-3441352.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/vlcsnap-3453004.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/vlcsnap-3453004.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/vlcsnap-3453696.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/vlcsnap-3453696.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------not my rip-----\n\n\n~~~~~~ Maurice Pialat - Police (1985).avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,468,342,272                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.0.1              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:48:45                \nFrame Count:....................................163103             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................656                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................400                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.640                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1569                 \n......MPEG-4........................N-VOP......                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.239&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................224                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n\n\n**********************************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
