And she's a train wreck. Janie sees only one way to give him the life he deserves: She has to disappear. And it's going to kill them both.\n \nThen a stranger enters her life - and everything unravels. The future Janie once faced now has an ominous twist, and her choices are more dire than she'd ever thought possible. She alone must decide between the lesser of two evils. And time is running out. . . .\n \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2040dd067a27a273165271bd166bdc8ea12853","amp;dn":"Gone+-+Lisa+McMann%2CEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2040dd067a27a273165271bd166bdc8ea12853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,32,64,221,6,122,39,162,115,22,82,113,189,22,107,220,142,161,40,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
