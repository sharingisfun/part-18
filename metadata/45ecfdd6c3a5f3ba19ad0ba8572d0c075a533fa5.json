George Washington, as Commander in Chief of the Continental Army, agreed with his British adversary that the Revolutionary War would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“carried on agreeable to the rules which humanity formedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“to prevent or punish every breach of the rules of war within the sphere of our respective commands.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ During the Civil War, President Lincoln approved a set of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Instructions for the Government of the Armies of the United States in the Field,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which inspired other countries to adopt similar codes for their armed forces, and which served as a template for international codifications of the law of war.\n\nAfter World War II, U.S. military lawyers, trying thousands of defendants before military commissions did, in the words of Justice Robert Jackson, Ã¢â‚¬Å“stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of lawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Reflecting on this distinctive history, one Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff observed that Ã¢â‚¬Å“[t]he laws of war have a peculiarly American cast.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And it is also true that the laws of war have shaped the U.S. Armed Forces as much as they have shaped any other armed force in the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45ecfdd6c3a5f3ba19ad0ba8572d0c075a533fa5","amp;dn":"Department+of+Defense+Law+of+War+Manual+June+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45ecfdd6c3a5f3ba19ad0ba8572d0c075a533fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,236,253,214,195,165,243,186,25,173,11,168,87,45,12,7,90,83,63,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
