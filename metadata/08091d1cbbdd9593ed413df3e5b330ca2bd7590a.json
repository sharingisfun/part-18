A newly-radicalized Islamic government has risen in Indonesia andâ€”after invading the Philippines, East Timor, and Papua New Guineaâ€”sets its sights on Australia. No longer protected by American military interests, Australia must repel an invasion alone.\r\nIn the thick of it all, Peter and Rhiannon Jeffords, American Christian missionaries in the Philippines, and Chuck Nolan, a Texan petroleum engineer in Australia, find themselves adrift in a world in flux. Chronicling the Jeffordsâ€™ and Nolanâ€™s fight against Indonesiaâ€™s merciless advances, Expatriates is a riveting thriller and a powerful depiction of the authentic skills and techniques needed to survive the collapse of modern civilization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08091d1cbbdd9593ed413df3e5b330ca2bd7590a","amp;dn":"James+Wesley+Rawles+-Expatriates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08091d1cbbdd9593ed413df3e5b330ca2bd7590a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,9,29,28,187,221,149,147,237,65,61,243,229,179,48,202,43,215,89,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
