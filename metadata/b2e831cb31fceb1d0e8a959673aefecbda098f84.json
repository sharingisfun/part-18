In this time, some young people make a breakthrough in this era.\n\nIt is the first year of Genji (1864)*, March. A spring where cherry blossoms scatter and dance in the air of Kyoto. A single young man knocks at the door of the headquarters of the Mibu Shinsengumi (the newly established Mibu team). His name was Ichimura Tetsunosuke, aged 15. His personality, as his name suggests, is Teppoudama*\n\nUnlike his height, Tetsunosuke possesses great will power and hopes to join the Shinsengumi to avenge his parents. He is allowed to join the team on the condition that he can win against the talented swordsman Okita Souji*. And so, Tetsunosuke challenges Okita.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2e831cb31fceb1d0e8a959673aefecbda098f84","amp;dn":"%5BAHQ%5D+Peace+Maker+Kurogane+%28Complete%29+%28Eps+1-24%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2e831cb31fceb1d0e8a959673aefecbda098f84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,232,49,203,49,252,235,29,14,138,149,150,115,174,254,203,218,9,143,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
