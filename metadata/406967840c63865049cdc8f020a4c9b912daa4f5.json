Employing the key feature of further reading with many of the terms, the book uses the subject classification system defined by the American Economic Review and The Economic Journal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406967840c63865049cdc8f020a4c9b912daa4f5","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2002%5D+Routledge+Dictionary+of+Economics+%282nd+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406967840c63865049cdc8f020a4c9b912daa4f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,105,103,132,12,99,134,80,73,205,200,240,32,164,201,185,18,218,164,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
