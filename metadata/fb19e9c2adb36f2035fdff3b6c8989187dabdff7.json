Rolling Stone has called them &quot;the perfect musical \nantiheroes for the Seventies.&quot;\n\nThe band's music is characterized by complex jazz-influenced structures and harmonies played\nby Becker and Fagen along with a revolving cast of rock and pop studio musicians. Steely Dan's \n&quot;cerebral, wry and eccentric&quot; lyrics, often filled with sharp sarcasm, touch upon such themes \nas drugs, love affairs, and crime. The pair is well-known for their near-obsessive perfectionism \nin the recording studio, with one notable example being that Becker and Fagen used at least 42 \ndifferent studio musicians, 11 engineers, and took over a year to record the tracks that resulted \nin 1980's Gaucho Ã¢â‚¬â€ an album that contains only seven songs\n\n\ndo it again\n\n\n   1.
