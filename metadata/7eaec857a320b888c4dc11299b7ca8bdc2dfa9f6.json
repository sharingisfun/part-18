This nugget attracts the attention of a man named McCracken who, with his gang, secretly follows Garrett across the desert in the hope of finding the source of his gold. Garrett joins up with his partner, Jim Rainbolt, and together they manage to hold off McCracken's gang long enough to hide their gold before seeking refuge in the hacienda of a landowner named Gondora. Gondora soon finds out about the gold, however, and Rainbolt and Garrett now find themselves in a fight to save their gold and their lives as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eaec857a320b888c4dc11299b7ca8bdc2dfa9f6","amp;dn":"Gold+of+the+Seven+Saints++%28Western+1961%29++Clint+Walker%2C+Roger+Mo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eaec857a320b888c4dc11299b7ca8bdc2dfa9f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,174,200,87,163,32,184,136,196,220,17,41,155,124,168,189,194,223,169,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
