It incorporates information from such sub-disciplines such as developmental psychology, human development across the life span, curriculum and instruction, motivation, and measurement and assessment. It has evolved to become a field that increasingly focuses on individual differences without any regard to age thereby leading to interests in topics such as (early) intervention, long distance learning, educational technology, adult education, and theories of human development among others. Neil Salkind has mined the rich and extensive backlist of SAGE education and psychology journals to pull together a collection of almost a 100 articles to be the definitive research resource on education psychology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5585bbbe7a514289b72e0840eb9aba4557f20c2c","amp;dn":"SAGE+Directions+in+Educational+Psychology+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5585bbbe7a514289b72e0840eb9aba4557f20c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,133,187,190,122,81,66,137,183,46,8,64,235,154,186,69,87,242,12,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
