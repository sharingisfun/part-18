Juno's sound is in a continual            :\n :           state of evolution, always moving ahead of the pack.             :\n :           In the early 90's, long before it was hip or hyped,              :\n :           they'd forged their sound from the trance vibe going             :\n :           off in Goa.                                                      :\n :                                                                            :\n :           Juno, unwilling to stagnate in a spiral of repetition            :\n :           and predictability, had moved on by beginning to                 :\n :           incorporate more live elements and 'real' musicians. A           :\n :           move to BLUE ROOM resulted in 1995's 'GUARDIAN ANGEL'            :\n :           single and 'BEYOND THE INFINITE' album, still                    :\n :           displaying heavy trance influences, yet pushing away             :\n :           from the purist attitude by employing more varied                :\n :           elements including break beats.                                  :\n :                                                                            :\n :           By the 'BIBLE OF DREAMS' album of 1997, Juno had moved           :\n :           dynamically away from the ebb and flow of that                   :\n :           previous rambling 'musical journey' style towards a              :\n :           much more punchy and focused sound. Ben came into                :\n :           contact with traditional South African percussion act            :\n :           AMAMPONDO ( Nelson Mandela's favorite band) and with             :\n :           conga player MABI THOBEJANE co-wrote 'CONGA FURY'                :\n :           which was released as a single, to great acclaim.                :\n :           Ben and Amampondo embarked upon a 5 week tour of the             :\n :           U.S as support act to MOBY. Realising that a change of           :\n :           show was needed for the American audience, the Juno              :\n :           Reactor live show switched from the standard dark,               :\n :           sombre set to a visually spectacular show with Ben               :\n :           providing the techno and playing cock rocking guitar             :\n :           riffs while Amampondo, clad in body paint and full               :\n :           costume wowed the crowds with circus acrobatics while            :\n :           beating out their percussion rhythms. This wasn't a              :\n :           cliched case of 'ethnic' vocal wails over driving                :\n :           techno beats but instead a genuine collision of                  :\n :           diverse musical cultures feeding from each other to              :\n :           provide a unique live experience. The idea of DJ                 :\n :           domination and and shadowy figures hunched over mixing           :\n :           desks was blown away in favor of something more akin             :\n :           to theatre, an inspirational subversion of the techno            :\n :           principle.                                                       :\n :                                                                            :\n :           As well as his own original productions, Ben has also            :\n :           remixed artists such as DEVO, TALKING HEADS, FATIMA              :\n :           MANSIONS, SIOUXIE &amp; THE BANSHEES and KILLING JOKE as             :\n :           well as composing and producing four tracks for former           :\n :           porn star TRACI LORDS' debut album '1000 Fires'.                 :\n :                                                                            :\n :           His dramatic instrumental versions have all since                :\n :           appeared on film soundtracks for punchy action movies            :\n :           like 'MORTAL KOMBAT', 'VIRTUOSITY', 'ERASER', 'LOST IN           :\n :           SPACE' (with Siouxsie Sue) and the trailers for 'ROMEO           :\n :           &amp; JULIET', 'TOMB RAIDER' &amp; the forthcoming Robert                :\n :           Rodrigez film 'ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO'.                      :\n :                                                                            :\n :           Ben has also composed the score for the forthcoming              :\n :           movie 'BEOWULF' starring Christopher Lambert and                 :\n :           provided three new tracks to Playstation's Jet Moto 2            :\n :           game as well as the entire score to 'MARK OF KRI'.               :\n :                                                                            :\n :           The fifth Juno Reactor album, entitled 'Shango' and              :\n :           named after a Nigerian God of Thunder was released in            :\n :           2000.
