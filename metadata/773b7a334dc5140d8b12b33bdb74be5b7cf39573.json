I tried and failed to get tickets. Then this show appeared with very little information as to what it would actually be, but it's Beck so I had to try - and this time I got my ticket. \n\nTen years ago, I went to a show at Stanford put on by McSweeney's. They Might Be Giants were on stage to play songs during and between people reading stories, and then they played an hour at the end. I was hoping this would be similar, especially with the show being named after Beck's book of sheet music. It turned out to be a lot of different musicians/actors playing songs from the book, with Beck doing 3 songs and a Q&amp;A in the middle of the show with Justin and Roger and then doing another song at the end with Justin and the International Space Orchestra. Throughout the evening were also stories and presentations, and the occasional live advertisement (these were actually pretty funny). Overall, it was an interesting show and I'm glad I was there. One of the songs Beck played was its live debut, and the other 3 he played live for the first time the night before.\n\nSound's pretty decent, but a lot of what happened was very quiet and I was far back.
