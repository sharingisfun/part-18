He guides us from the building of Stonehenge to the founding of the two great glories of medieval England: common law and the cathedrals. He shows us glimpses of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most distant pastÃ¢â‚¬â€and Neolithic stirrup found in a grave, a Roman fort, a Saxon tomb, a medieval manor houseÃ¢â‚¬â€and describes in rich prose the successive waves of invaders who made England English, despite being themselves Roman, Viking, Saxon, or Norman French.\n\nWith his extraordinary skill for evoking time and place and his acute eye for the telling detail, Ackroyd recounts the story of warring kings, of civil strife, and foreign wars. But he also gives us a vivid sense of how EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early people lived: the homes they built, the clothes the wore, the food they ate, even the jokes they told. All are brought vividly to life through the narrative mastery of one of BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest writers.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-E9E2_52AA217B.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-E9E2_52AA217B.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e60affbb974dabcd417289ad0fa494a521a344","amp;dn":"Foundation%3A+The+History+of+England+from+Its+Earliest+Beginnings+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e60affbb974dabcd417289ad0fa494a521a344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,230,10,255,187,151,77,171,205,65,114,137,173,15,164,148,165,33,163,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
