L490\n\n  Emotional bloodletting never quite fit 30 Seconds to Mars -- perhaps it was residual prejudice from Jared LetoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status as actor-turned-musician, but they always seemed to skim the surface, not even when they pushed roiling emotions to the forefront in the best traditions of grunge and screamo. When they were mining a post-grunge or nu metal or emo vein, this was a liability, but now that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve shifted their music with the shifting times, adopting a hybrid of the KillersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ retro new wave and My Chemical RomanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gothic prog, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve wound up with a sound that suits their stance. Which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t to say that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gotten any less ridiculous -- if anything, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re more absurd, piling up Auto-Tuned vocals, gurgling synthesized loops, Kanye cameos, and a children's choir on almost every other song. Producers Steve Lillywhite and Flood, both veterans of U2, do give This Is War an appropriately epic scale, although appropriate seems an inappropriate word for such an ungainly mix of synth rock, metal, and prog, the distillation of all manner of brooding Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s teenage obsessions. What saves it from being nothing but thirtysomething wish fulfillment is that this move toward goth-glam requires 30 Seconds to emphasize hooks and gives them aural variety, which doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make them seem any more serious but does make them considerably more palatable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5134cb012d3f78aedd925cd6c961035cd95d3d8c","amp;dn":"30+Seconds+to+Mars+-+This+Is+War+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5134cb012d3f78aedd925cd6c961035cd95d3d8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,52,203,1,45,63,120,174,221,146,92,214,201,97,3,92,217,93,61,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
