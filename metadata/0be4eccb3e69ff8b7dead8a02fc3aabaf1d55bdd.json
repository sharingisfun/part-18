Joseph Losey\nstarring . . . Hardy KrÃƒÂ¼ger, Stanley Baker, Micheline Presle\n\nBAFTA Film Award - Best British Screenplay\n\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt0052634/\n\nThis above average whodunit was directed with style and conviction by Joseph Losey, an American ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© in London who brought much of his own feelings of cultural and social displacement to bear. Hardy KrÃƒÂ¼ger is the foreigner in London who gets framed for murder and Stanley Baker the flinty Welshman from Scotland Yard. Both men are caught in a class system they resent but remain resolute in their commitment to the truth. Also known as Blind Date, the first part of the story is told largely in flashback from the scene of the crime.\n\nVideo: DivX 5, 688x432, 932 kbps, 25 fps, 01h30m20s\nAudio: MP3, 44100 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps, English, no subtitles\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EaAHFaAGa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EaAHFaAGa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAAHGaagA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAAHGaagA&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be4eccb3e69ff8b7dead8a02fc3aabaf1d55bdd","amp;dn":"Chance+Meeting+-+1959++%28British+Crime+Drama%29++dir.+Joseph+Losey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be4eccb3e69ff8b7dead8a02fc3aabaf1d55bdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,228,236,203,62,105,255,139,125,234,216,160,47,195,170,186,241,213,91,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
