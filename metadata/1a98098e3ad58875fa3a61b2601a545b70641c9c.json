When the reindeer leap skyward taking the sleigh, devil men, and\nSanta into the clouds, screams follow. Moments later, a large sack plummets\nearthward, a magical sack that will thrust the down-on-his luck singer into\nthe clutches of the terrifying Yule Lord, Krampus. But the lines between good\nand evil become blurred as Jesse's new master reveals many dark secrets about\nthe cherry-cheeked Santa Claus, and how half a millennium ago, the jolly old\nsaint imprisoned Krampus and usurped his magic.\n\nNow Santa's time is running short, for the Yule Lord is determined to have his\nretribution and reclaim Yuletide. If Jesse can survive this ancient feud, he\nmight have the chance to redeem himself to his family, to save his own broken\ndreams...and help bring the magic of Yule to the impoverished folk of Boone\nCounty.\n\n=======\n\n1 x .epub\n1 x .mobi\n\nTotal size : 16.1 MB [16,891,190 bytes]\n\n=======\n\nAlternate :\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:1A98098E3AD58875FA3A61B2601A545B70641C9C\n\n=======\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a98098e3ad58875fa3a61b2601a545b70641c9c","amp;dn":"Krampus+The+Yule+Lord+-+Brom+-+2012+%5Bepub.mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a98098e3ad58875fa3a61b2601a545b70641c9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,152,9,142,58,213,136,117,250,58,97,178,96,26,84,91,112,100,28,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
