It's Me, Chelsea Ebook (mobi format)\n\nAre You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea is a 2008 best-selling book by Chelsea Handler that was released on April 22, 2008, by Simon Spotlight Entertainment, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. The book is a collection of humorous and mostly autobiographical essays about her life. Handler has stated in an interview with Barnes &amp; Noble, that she waited to write a book with such stories with no concrete theme and wrote My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One-Night Stands with the theme of one-night stands to get her enough popularity for this sort of book to do well. The title is satirically modeled after the Judy Blume novel Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.[1] As of 2008, with the release of Vodka, sales of her first book have since rocketed; the two titles have sold a combined 1.7 million copies, according to Nielsen BookScan and have both topped several best seller lists.\n\nPlots\n\n 1 Blacklisted\n 2 Chelsea in Charge\n 3 Prison Break\n 4 Bladder Stones\n 5 Big Red\n 6 Dining in the Dark\n 7 Dim Sum and Then Some\n 8 Barking Up the Wrong Tree\n 9 Re-Gift\n10 Jumped\n11 Mini Me\n12 Costa Rica","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70001b81633fb2e2b3376e141a075d9c8d82e1aa","amp;dn":"Are+You+There%2C+Vodka%3F+It%27s+Me%2C+Chelsea+Ebook+-+Chelsea+Handler.m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70001b81633fb2e2b3376e141a075d9c8d82e1aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,0,27,129,99,63,178,226,179,55,110,20,26,7,93,156,141,130,225,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
