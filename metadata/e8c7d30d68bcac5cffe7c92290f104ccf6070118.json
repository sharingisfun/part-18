The album features no fewer than four Top 10 singles, including the hot Latino club grooves of &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You&quot; and &quot;1-2-3,&quot; and the sweet, affecting ballads &quot;Anything for You&quot; and &quot;Can't Stay Away from You.&quot; By the time of the album's release in 1987, Estefan had not yet grown into the assured and charismatic singer she would become. And some of the songs here bear the cheesy production techniques of their time. Overall, however, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Anything For YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ shows an artist beginning to assert herself with considerable charm and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lan.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Betcha Say That\n[02] Let It Loose\n[03] Can't Stay Away From You\n[04] Give It Up\n[05] Surrender\n[06] Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\n[07] Love Toy\n[08] I Want You So Bad\n[09] 1-2-3\n[10] Anything For You\n[11] Rhythm Is Gonna Get You (Special Dance Mix)\n[12] Betcha Say That (Special Dance Mix)\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:53m:07s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 130mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 01 June 1987\n\nRecord Company\t\t- CBS Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.gloriaestefan.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/gloriaestefan \n\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8c7d30d68bcac5cffe7c92290f104ccf6070118","amp;dn":"%5B1987%5D+Anything+For+You+-+Gloria+Estefan+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8c7d30d68bcac5cffe7c92290f104ccf6070118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,199,211,13,104,188,172,92,255,231,201,34,144,241,4,204,246,7,1,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
