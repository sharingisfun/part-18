And from Australia, here is the group Air Supply at number 28 with, 'Lost In Love'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is one I found on the internet.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a song in the countdown that was written only an hour before it was first performed live at an audition for record company executives.\n\nThere is a single by a 64-year-old singer who first hit the charts forty years prior.\n\nCasey gives a special report on &quot;movie music&quot; in the 80s so far, and says this countdown sets a record for most movie songs in the top 40 (eight of them).\n\nThe Pretenders are at number 22. Casey explains what the title, &quot;Brass In Pocket&quot; means.\n\n&quot;Tired Of Toein' The Line&quot; (at number 18) is by Rocky Burnette, whom Casey says contributed his name to the word &quot;Rockabiliy,&quot;\n\nCasey remembers the childhood of Jerry Leiber which provided the background for him (and his partner Mike Stoller) to write shuch hits as &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, &quot;Don't&quot;, &quot;Kansas City&quot;, and &quot;Stand By Me.&quot;\n\nLW#3; Biggest Part Of Me - Ambrosia\nLW#2: Coming Up - Paul McCartney\nLW#1: Funky Town - Lipps, Inc.\n40:    Atomic - Blondie\n39:    Ashes By Now - Rodney Crowell\n38:    Angel Say No - Tommy Tutone        \n37:    Stand By Me - Mickey Gilley     \n36:    Take Your Time - S.O.S.
