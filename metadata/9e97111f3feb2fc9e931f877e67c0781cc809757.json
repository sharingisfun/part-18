Music has been a huge influence in all of their lives, and after playing in previous groups together, they decided that what they were doing musically wasn't reaching its full potential, and needed to create something more ear catching, and lovable, there for, For The Foxes was formed. This new take on music is very entertaining, but will have you singing along, making you realize why you loved music in the first place. After releasing their first E.P. entitled Six Ways to Love, For the Foxes has acheived critical success. The band has shared the stage with a number of signed acts, and their music has been featured on MTV. The band has high hopes of taking over the music world and someday becoming the kind of band that other bands derive inspiration from.
