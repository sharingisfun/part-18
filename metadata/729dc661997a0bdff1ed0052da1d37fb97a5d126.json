As with any art form, the underlying principles need to be understood before the real enjoyment can begin. Unfortunately, many men do not learn the true principles of cunnilingus at the outset and so, even with the best of intentions, their form is without substance. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a shame, because cunnilingus is one of the most effective ways to bring a woman to orgasm. It can also be one of the most pleasurable actsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for both of you.\n\n If we were to compare cunnilingus to another artÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the martial artsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it would be tai chi rather than kung fu. The literal translation of tai chi is supreme ultimate, whereas kung fu translates as skilled achievement. Over the years, and especially in Western culture, kung fu has come to mean a style of rapid punches, sharp kicks, and chopping blows. If you watch a lot of porn (and a lot of people do these days), you would think that female satisfaction relies on a &quot;kung fu&quot; approach to cunnilingus.\n\n Tai chi, on the other hand, is slow, focused, and graceful, with an emphasis on the balance of yin/yangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½male/female energyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to create a harmony of movement and strength. The unique approach to cunnilingus detailed in this guide involves many of the same principles as tai chi: stillness within movement, balance and pressure, resistance, and key postures. We call this approach the Mount Method.\n\n In this guide weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll begin with the fundamental concepts of the Mount Method, followed by the precise delineation of the basic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpathwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to pleasure, from foreplay to orgasm(s). WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also describe alternate pathways to her pleasure, many of which are only possible with the Mount Method, such as the Frenulum Pop. We will also introduce you to the Maxilla Press and the Pelvic Grind, among other techniques, which will enable you to convert a womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s movement and internal force into stimulation and stability. These techniques are helpful for staying on course to her orgasm. After we guide you through different pathways and techniques, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll end with the g-spot rodeo for the wildest ride of both of your lives.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729dc661997a0bdff1ed0052da1d37fb97a5d126","amp;dn":"The+Good+in+Bed+Guide+to+Orally+Pleasuring+a+Woman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729dc661997a0bdff1ed0052da1d37fb97a5d126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,157,198,97,153,122,11,223,241,237,0,82,218,29,55,251,151,165,209,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
