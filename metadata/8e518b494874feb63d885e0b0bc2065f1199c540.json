Fires. Fables.\nReleased: 2006\nLabel: Everyone Sang\nCatalog#: ES 2007\nFormat: FLAC / Lossless / Log (100%) / Cue\nCountry:UK\nStyle: folk\n\n\n1 This Is How It's Meant To Be \n2 Blackbird \n3 Home \n4 Orlando \n5 Under These Bruised Skies \n6 Fields Of June \n7 The Suitcase \n8 The Photo \n9 Mystery \n10 On A Train \n11 On A Winter's Day \n12 If Love Could Save\n\nOn her first album Photos Fires Fables, Emily has somehow managed to blend the borders of Folk and Americana in the way few artists outside of America have been able to do. Across the 12 songs on this album, Emily stamps out her personality with her soaring and magical vocals and imaginative and plaintive songwriting. \n\nHailing from Blackwood Valley in Western Australia, Emily struck a chord with the revered late BBC broadcaster John Peel who supported her playing tracks on his show. Emily's band The Red Clay Halo, provide sympathetic acoustic support without ever theatening to overwhelm her warm and sensitive voice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e518b494874feb63d885e0b0bc2065f1199c540","amp;dn":"Emily+Barker+-+Photos.+Fires.+Fables.+%5B2006%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e518b494874feb63d885e0b0bc2065f1199c540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,81,139,73,72,116,254,182,61,136,94,11,11,194,6,95,17,153,197,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
