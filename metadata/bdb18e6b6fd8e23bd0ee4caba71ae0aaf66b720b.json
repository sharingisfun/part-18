It has been published in Shogakukan's Monthly Sunday Gene-X since 2002, and ten collected volumes have been released so far. It was later adapted into an anime television series by Madhouse, that aired from April to June 2006 for twelve episodes. A second season, subtitled &quot;The Second Barrage&quot;, ran for twelve weeks starting on October 2, 2006.\r\n\r\n[PLOT - SPOILER ALERT]\r\n\r\nThe story follows a team of pirate mercenaries known as Lagoon Company, that smuggles goods in and around the seas of Southeast Asia in the early to mid 1990s. Their base of operations is located in the fictional harbor city of Roanapur in southeast Thailand (somewhere in the Amphoe Mueang Trat district, likely on the mainland north/northeast of the Ko Chang island or on the island itself). The island is home to the Yakuza, the Triad, Cuban and French cartels, and a wide assortment of pickpockets, thugs, mercenaries, thieves, prostitutes, assassins, and Gunmen of all sorts. They transport goods in the 80-foot (24 m) Elco-type PT boat Black Lagoon. Lagoon Company does business with various clients, but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missionsâ€”which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battlesâ€”in various Southeast Asian locations, even going as far as Phu Quoc island of Vietnam and when not doing much, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur which is often destroyed in firefights.\r\n\r\n[TECHNICAL DETAILS]\r\n\r\nSource: BD / Torrent: [OZC]Black Lagoon Complete Season 1+2\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Container: MKV\r\nVideo Format: h.265/HEVC [8-bit]\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n\r\nAudio Type: Mixed\r\nTrack 1: English (5.1 Channel Surround)\r\nTrack 2: Japanese (2 Channel Stereo)\r\nAudio Format: AAC-LC\r\n\r\nSubtitle Language: English\r\nSubtitle Format: SSA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdb18e6b6fd8e23bd0ee4caba71ae0aaf66b720b","amp;dn":"Black+Lagoon+%5BDUAL-AUDIO%5D+%5B1080p%5D+%5BHEVC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdb18e6b6fd8e23bd0ee4caba71ae0aaf66b720b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,177,142,107,111,216,226,59,208,238,76,171,167,26,224,170,246,107,114,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
