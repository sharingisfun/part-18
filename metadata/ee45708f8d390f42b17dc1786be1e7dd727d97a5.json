It stars Humphrey Bogart as detective Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the &quot;process of a criminal investigation, not its results.&quot; William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay.\n\nIn 1997, the U.S. Library of Congress deemed this film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant,&quot; and added it to the National Film Registry.\n\n1940s Hollywood produced a plethora of stylish, film noir thrillers but, in your humble narratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s opinion at least, none beat 'The Big Sleep' for overall coolness and entertainment value. The film is based on Raymond ChandlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1939 novel and features his hard-boiled private detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart), who becomes caught up in the affairs of aging millionaire General Sternwood and his two beautiful daughters. Hired to investigate who is blackmailing SternwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s younger daughter Carmen over unresolved gambling debts, Marlowe swiftly realizes (as do we) that the whole situation is much more complex than he initially thought.\n\nIn terms of plot, this film definitely could make a claim for being one of the most convoluted and bewildering ever written. However we soon realise that the actual storyline is of supreme unimportance. There are lots of deaths, an exciting shoot-out and something about drug addiction and (less overtly!) a pornography racket. But what the film really focuses on is the smouldering chemistry between Marlowe and Vivian Sternwood (a wonderful Lauren Bacall) who is CarmenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s older sister. The innuendo-ridden, wise-cracking dialogue between them works a treat. As the central character, Bogart plays his world weary private eye persona to wryly sardonic, whiskey-drenched perfection. Add a brooding soundtrack by Hollywood legend Max Steiner and unexpected bursts of humour (the number of women throwing themselves at Bogie throughout the film eventually becomes a bit much!) and you have a fabulously escapist, seductively sleazy tale. Go see.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\The Big Sleep (1946)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\The Big Sleep (1946)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 2.30 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 892 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf51.12.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate                         : 2 561 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 540 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.275\nStream size                      : 2.04 GiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : Lavc51.40.4\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 261 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.63 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5221\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/30/2010 10:18:26 PM\nmbam-log-2010-11-30 (22-18-26).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 21 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
