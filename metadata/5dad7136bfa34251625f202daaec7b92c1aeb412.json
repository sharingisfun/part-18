Her notion is shouted down by the scientific minds of the group. But one man, Ronald Fisher, proposes to scientifically test the hypothesis. There is no better person to conduct such an experiment, for Fisher is a pioneer in the field of statistics.\n\nThe Lady Tasting Tea spotlights not only Fisher's theories but also the revolutionary ideas of dozens of men and women which affect our modern everyday lives. Writing with verve and wit, David Salsburg traces breakthroughs ranging from the rise and fall of Karl Pearson's theories to the methods of quality control that rebuilt postwar Japan's economy, including a pivotal early study on the capacity of a small beer cask at the Guinness brewing factory. Brimming with intriguing tidbits and colorful characters, The Lady Tasting Tea salutes the spirit of those who dared to look at the world in a new way.\n\n\nContents\n========\n\n    Author's Preface VII \n\n    1  The Lady Tasting Tea\n    2  The Skew Distributions\n    3  That Dear Mr. Gosset\n    4  Raking Over the Muck Heap\n    5  &quot;Studies in Crop Variation&quot;\n    6  &quot;The Hundred-Year Flood&quot;\n    7  Fisher Triumphant\n    8  The Dose that Kills\n    9  The Bell-Shaped Curve\n    10 Testing the Goodness of Fit\n\n    11 Hypothesis Testing\n    12 The Confidence Trick\n    13 The Bayesian Heresy\n    14 The Mozart of Mathematics\n    15 The Worm's-Eye View\n    16 Doing Away with Parameters\n    17 When Part is Better than the Whole\n    18 Does Smoking Cause Cancer?\n    19 If You Want the Best Person...\n    20 Just a Plain Texas Farm Boy\n\n    21 A Genius in the Family\n    22 The Picasso of Statistics\n    23 Dealing with Contamination\n    24 The Man Who Remade Industry\n    25 Advice from the Lady in Black\n    26 The March of the Martingales\n    27 The Intent to Treat\n    28 The Computer Turns upon Itself\n    29 The Idol with Feet of Clay\n       Afterword\n       Timeline\n       Bibliography\n       Index\n\n\nAuthor\n======\nDavid Salsburg is a retired pharmaceutical company statistician and currently works as a private consultant.
