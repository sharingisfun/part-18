The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.\n\nM A U R O P I C O T T O D J D J - Say it one letter at a time, and you have the main lyrics in a megasmashhitdanceflooranthem. So, with dancefloor hits like Lizard, Pulsar, Komodo, Like this Like that, it's not surprising that this guy made it big - but it is his consistent playing of sets that really sets him apart (tee hee, I made a punny!).\n\nHe has played all over the world, with an earlier heavier sound in his live sets, bordering on eclectic in their rhythms, opulent bass pounding beats, but has also wavered into a more trancey sound (as a few of the sets will show). For a good while, Mauro and Chris Liebing seemed to have a competition on the island of Ibiza to see who could get the biggest posters of themselves advertising their gigs - Chris Liebing won. One f the best compliments that I ever heard about Mauro was when I dragged a friend to his first rave. Being quite tired by the time Mauro came on, he was lying down away from the main core of dancers but couldn't help but get up and start dancing a few minutes into his heavy pounding set - &quot;It's like the fucking floor is pounding with this beat!!&quot;. Mauro Picotto, a man that can use a concrete floor as a speaker. Godly indeed!\n\nEnjoy this 32+ hours of the godly Mauro Picotto.\n\nMauro Picotto - Live @ ARIA Nightclub, Montreal - 20040130.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Galaxy Mixmasters - 20020223.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Gatecrasher - 20020200.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Gatecrasher NEC - 20020413.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Godskitchen 5th Birthday - 20020928.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Godskitchen Amnesia Ibiza 2001.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Ibiza.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Innercity - 20011229.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Krugerhalle Essen - 20020510.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Love Parade, Turbinenhalle Berlin 2000.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Mayday 2001 - 20010501.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Meganite Ibiza 2007.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Meganite Ibiza - 20040707.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Nature One - 20020803.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ OXA Zurich - 20020419.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Partyservice Spezial Essen - 20020510.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Qlimax - 20010600.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Rosenmontags Rave - 20000306.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Rosenmontags Rave - 20010226.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Sensation Black - Amsterdam Arena - 20020814.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Trance Energy - 20010217.mp3\nMauro Picotto - Live @ Trance Energy (Longer) - 20010217.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89aa517a398fba80e8b026a1530d661e80b58811","amp;dn":"Gods+Collection+-+Mauro+Picotto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89aa517a398fba80e8b026a1530d661e80b58811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,170,81,122,57,143,186,128,232,176,38,161,83,13,102,30,128,181,136,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
