Seven years after Cities of the Plain brought his acclaimed Border Trilogy to a close, McCarthy returns with a mesmerizing modern-day western. In 1980 southwest Texas, Llewelyn Moss, hunting antelope near the Rio Grande, stumbles across several dead men, a bunch of heroin and $2.4 million in cash. The bulk of the novel is a gripping man-on-the-run sequence relayed in terse, masterful prose as Moss, who's taken the money, tries to evade Wells, an exÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Special Forces agent employed by a powerful cartel, and Chigurh, an icy psychopathic murderer armed with a cattle gun and a dangerous philosophy of justice. Also concerned about Moss's whereabouts is Sheriff Bell, an aging lawman struggling with his sense that there's a new breed of man (embodied in Chigurh) whose destructive power he simply cannot match. In a series of thoughtful first-person passages interspersed throughout, Sheriff Bell laments the changing world, wrestles with an uncomfortable memory from his service in WWII andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a soft ray of light in a book so steeped in bloodshedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½rejoices in the great good fortune of his marriage. While the action of the novel thrills, it's the sensitivity and wisdom of Sheriff Bell that makes the book a profound meditation on the battle between good and evil and the roles choice and chance play in the shaping of a life.\n\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His newest novel updates his character-driven plots and themes of violence and moral ambiguity. Perhaps the true sign of a master is one whose work raises debateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and this is what No Country has done. Most critics praised McCarthyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clean, simple prose, though a few thought it too spare for such a graceful stylist. (&quot;The man looked at ChigurhÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes for the first time. Blue as lapis. At once glistening and opaque. Like wet stones.&quot;) Compelling characters (even women) abound, but Sheriff Bell came off as either smart or too long winded. Finally, the violence seemed gratuitous to some. Even if No Country may be a more minor McCarthy novel, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still a terrifying page-turner in the vein of the Trilogy.\n\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2004 Phillips &amp; Nelson Media, Inc.
