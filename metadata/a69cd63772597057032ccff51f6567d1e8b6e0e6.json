The most famous song must be &quot;guardian Angel&quot;. One year later a group named Masquerade did a cover of this song, but this is the original on this record.\n\nThis is a vinyl rip with all defects as flutter, scraps and such still left, but its not very much &quot;noise&quot; so its ok.\n\nBitrate is 128 kb. Front and back cover also included.\n\nTracks:\nA01-Guardian Angel.mp3\nA02-Unchained Love.mp3\nA03-Ways of the world.mp3\nA04-Heaven And Hell With Louisa.mp3\nA05-Hot And Cold.mp3\nB01-Young Blood.mp3\nB02-I.ll Never Die Again.mp3\nB03-No More.mp3\nB04-Its Hard To Live With A Lie.mp3\nB05-Soemtimes When I,m Sleeping.mp3\n\nEnjoy and seed back","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a69cd63772597057032ccff51f6567d1e8b6e0e6","amp;dn":"Nino+De+Angelo+-+Nino+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a69cd63772597057032ccff51f6567d1e8b6e0e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,156,214,55,114,89,112,87,3,44,207,245,31,101,103,209,232,182,224,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
