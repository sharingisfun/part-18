Sexton, raised in Austin, TX, made his debut with Pictures for Pleasure in 1985 at age 16. He followed that up with a self-titled second album when he was 20. Because word of his reputation as a prodigy guitar player spread far and wide, he found himself an in-demand session player while still in his late teens, and he had the opportunity to record with Ron Wood, Keith Richards, and Bob Dylan.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n01.Beat's So Lonely\n02.Impressed\n03.Restless\n04.Don't Look Back\n05.Blowing Up Detroit\n06.Cry Little Sister\n07.Living In A Dream\n08.Paradise Cafe\n09.Sweet Nadine\n10.Everyone Will Crawl\n11.Dark\n12.Neighborhood\n13.Ugly All Day\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:914f3dadb91fd197ce3ff348a664f3149a2427d2","amp;dn":"Charlie+Sexton+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282005%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"914f3dadb91fd197ce3ff348a664f3149a2427d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,79,61,173,185,31,209,151,206,63,243,72,166,100,243,20,154,36,39,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
