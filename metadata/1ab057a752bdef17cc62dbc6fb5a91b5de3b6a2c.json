The driving Dies Irae with its &amp;#039;hip-hop&amp;#039; percussion beat provides the soundtrack to the current Lynx commercial. Karl says &quot; I have set the usual Latin text but as is my wont, have drawn on cultures outside the European, setting five Japanese haiku poems dealing with death. These evocative concise poems of but seventeen syllables often equate life with the water cycle or cherry blossom. For these haiku, I have introduced the ancient Japanese flute, the shakuhachi into the orchestration. The work is dedicated to my late father, a musician and an inspiration.\n\nThis album also includes the work In These Stones Horizons Sing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab057a752bdef17cc62dbc6fb5a91b5de3b6a2c","amp;dn":"Karl+Jenkins+-+Requiem+%5B2005-FLAC-Lossless%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab057a752bdef17cc62dbc6fb5a91b5de3b6a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,176,87,167,82,189,239,23,204,98,219,198,251,90,145,181,222,59,106,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
