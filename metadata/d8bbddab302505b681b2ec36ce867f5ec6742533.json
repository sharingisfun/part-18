He lost no time in telling me he was diabetic. \nÃ¢â‚¬ËœDo you smoke?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ I asked.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœLike a chimney,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ he replied. \nHe was completely unrepentant, so refreshingly different from all those snivelling wheedlers with hangdog expressions who give you a long story about how they nearly gave up but then their budgerigar died. I got the picture at once. \nÃ¢â‚¬ËœAnd of course, you drink like a fish,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ I said. \nÃ¢â‚¬ËœLike a fish,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ he replied. \nÃ¢â‚¬ËœDieting is out of the question?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ I continued, with mounting admiration. \nÃ¢â‚¬ËœCompletely, I love butter and cream, and meat with fat on it, and rich sauces.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ \nÃ¢â‚¬ËœWell,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ I said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure you know the risks better than I, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not going to lecture you. But if you invite me to dinner, I shall come.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ \nThat was twelve years ago. His wife was, and is, a magnificent cook.\nI wish I could say the story had a happy ending, but honesty compels me to relate that recently he had two heart attacks which have laid him low. He can hardly breathe, and now he needs cardiac surgery.&quot; \nAxe-wielding maniacs, 'arthuritis' sufferers and apple crumble-cooking rapists... they're all here, along with pullulating graphomaniacs, avaricious lawyers, empire-building bureaucrats and the poor, huddled masses of the slum near Dalrymple's hospital in inner-city Britain.\nThis is the earliest - and funniest - collection of his celebrated 'If Symptoms Persist' pieces for The Spectator.\nAlso includes essays from the follow up book 'If Symptoms Still \nPersist.'\nPraise for If Symptoms Persist:\n'Compulsively Funny.' The Sunday Telegraph\n'One of the definitive tracts for our time.' The Daily Telegraph\n'Dalrymple's is the crystal voice of reason. What a refreshing voice this is!'
