Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements - fire, water, air, and earth - to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.\n\nEach section of Cooked tracks Pollan's effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements.\n\n1. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire\n2. A Chez Panisse - trained cook schools him in the art of braising\n3. A celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread\n4. And finally, several mad-genius &quot;fermentos&quot; (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all.\n\nThe reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships. Cooking, above all, connects us.\n\nThe effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;[A] rare, ranging breed of narrative that manages to do all... It's nothing short of important, possibly life-altering, reading for every living, breathing human being... In Pollan's dexterous hands, we get the science, the history, the inspiration, ultimately the recipe. What feels like all of it. It doesn't hurt that he also happens to be very funny.&quot;\n--Boston Globe\n\n&quot;Because of the power of his prose and his reasoning, Cooked may prove to be just as influential as Pollan's seminal book, The Omnivore's Dilemma... The results are fascinating, but the magic of Cooked lies not in its ability to unlock the secrets of slow-roasting a whole hog or brewing beer... No, what Pollan pulls off is even more impressive: He manages to illuminate the wealth of connections that stem from our DIY time in the kitchen.&quot;\n--The Washington Post\n\n&quot;The book's surplus of fascinating tidbits - about everything from barbecue (which Pollan connects to ritual animal sacrifice) to the mysterious workings of bread yeast - makes it a feast for intellectual omnivores.&quot;\n--Entertainment Weekly\n\n&quot;New York Times best-selling author Pollan (The Botany of Desire; The Omnivore's Dilemma) delivers a thoughtful meditation on cooking that is both difficult to categorize and uniquely, inimitably his... Intensely focused yet wide ranging, beautifully written, thought provoking, and, yes, fun, Pollan's latest is not to be missed by those interested in how, why, or what we cook and eat.&quot;\n--Library Journal (starred review)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMichael Pollan is the author of six previous books, including Food Rules, In Defense of Food, The Omnivore's Dilemma, and The Botany of Desire, all New York Times bestsellers. A longtime contributor to The New York Times, he is also the Knight Professor of Journalism at Berkeley. In 2010, Time magazine named him one of the one hundred most influential people in the world.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon Customer Ratings (156 Reviews):\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5 star: (111)\n4 star: (25)\n3 star: (10)\n2 star: (5)\n1 star: (5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
