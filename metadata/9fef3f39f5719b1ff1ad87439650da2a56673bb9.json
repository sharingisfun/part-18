Its international English title is Dance in the Rain. It is a love drama based on the novel Ãƒâ€žÃ…â€™rni dnevi in beli dan by Dominik Smole.\n\nIt is Hladnik's first feature film after he returned from Paris, where he worked with Claude Chabrol, Robert Siodmak &amp; Philippe de Broca.\n\nOn the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of Slovene film in 2005, Slovene film critics of various generations chose Ples v deÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ju as the best Slovene film. The Film Fund of the Republic of Slovenia thus funded its DVD release to in honour this anniversary. It was the first Slovene film to have its image and sound digitally corrected. A discussion with BoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡tjan Hladnik was filmed especially for this edition. The director also participated in the choice of other materials included on the DVD: film trailers, excerpts from Enfant Terrible (1993) - the documentary portrait of BoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡tjan Hladnik directed by Damjan Kozole, excerpts from the television show PoveÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ava (&quot;Magnification&quot;, 1991) directed by Franci Slak, and excerpts from the documentary portrait of the actor Miha Baloh (1998) directed by Slavko Hren. \n\nPlot summary\n\nA love drama of MaruÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡a, an actress and Peter, a painter. He lives in a dark tiny rented room and she lives in a small flat. They both spend most of their time in a pub where they meet. Their relationship is full of uncertainties and contrasts. Peter dreams of perfect beauty and MaruÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡a yearns for lost youth. A bright window to the future shown throughout the film seems to be moving further and further away\n\n\n------------------\n\n*not my rip*\n\nSOURCE: PAL DVD\nRIPPER: [YuWa]divac\nRELEASE DATE: 23/7/2005\nGENRE: Drama\nRUNTIME: 99 minutes = 1h 38m 30s\nVIDEO BITRATE: 873 kb/s XviD at 25 fps\nAUDIO BITRATE: 105 kb/s VBR Stereo MP3 at 44100 Hz\nASPECT RATIO: approx. 16:9 = 1.714:1\nRESOLUTION: 576x336\nCOLOR: Black and White\nAVI SIZE: 694,9 MB = 711,612 KB = 728,690,688 B","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fef3f39f5719b1ff1ad87439650da2a56673bb9","amp;dn":"Dancing+in+the+Rain+%2F+Ples+v+dezju+%281961%2C+Bostjan+Hladnik%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fef3f39f5719b1ff1ad87439650da2a56673bb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,239,63,57,245,113,155,31,241,173,135,67,150,80,218,42,86,103,59,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
