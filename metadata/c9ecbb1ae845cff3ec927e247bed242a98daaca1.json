These classic recordings, including &quot;She Ain't Goin' Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Desperados Waiting for the Train,&quot; may date back to the mid-'70s, but their production holds up decades later. None of that horrible Nashville spit and polish of the era distracts from Clark's fine songs. Essential listening for fans of today's alternative country and folk singer/songwriters. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/11/15/guy-clark/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9ecbb1ae845cff3ec927e247bed242a98daaca1","amp;dn":"Guy+Clark...Old+No.+1-Texas+Cookin%5C%27%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9ecbb1ae845cff3ec927e247bed242a98daaca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,236,187,26,232,69,207,243,236,146,126,36,123,237,36,42,152,218,172,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
