His scientific books demonstrating the proofs of creation to be seen in the universe, his works about Islamic moral teaching composed with reference to the verses of the Qur'an, and his political books that expose the hidden side of historical events have addressed millions of people of every nation, language and religion. These works have stimulated a wide response throughout the world.\n\nglobal impact of the works of harun yahyaWhether in America, Britain, Russia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, France, Nigeria, Canada or Lebanon, you can find books and magazine and newspaper articles by Harun Yahya in various languages in bookstores in most countries in the world. Documentaries and narrations based on Harun Yahya's works, which are broadcast on many radio and television stations, have also aroused great interest throughout the world.\n\nThe works of this author have been translated into French, German, Italian, Russian, Albanian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Serbo-Croat, Indonesian, Malay, Urdu, Estonian, Arabic, Swahili and Bengali, and further translations into many other languages are progressing quickly. The purpose of this is to distribute all these books throughout the world in order to inform all people of the existence of God, the beauty of the moral teachings of the Qur'an, the existence of the hereafter and the lie of Darwinism.\n\nHarun Yahya, who has written his works in order to spread the message of the Qur'an to the whole world and to encourage people to think about matters of faith, such as the existence of God and His Oneness, aims to make them easily accessible to everyone. With this purpose in mind, Internet sites have been opened that render a great service to thousands of people every day. On these sites, the more than 170 books written by Harun Yahya, complete with their full texts and illustrations, are available free of charge to Internet users, in addition to documentaries and audio narrations. This is a service rarely found on the Internet. Other book promotion sites introduce the works by giving a short summary or by listing the main headings. Except under exceptional circumstances, the whole text is provided at no cost. However, the Harun Yahya Internet site intends that everyone who wants to access all his works should be able to do so easily, and at absolutely no charge.\n\nThe purpose of this book is to inform people of the effect that Harun Yahya's works, from his books to the documentary films based on them, have had throughout the world. The book, which includes the Internet pages of those Islamic organizations, scientific institutions and various universities where you can find Harun Yahya's works, and reviews written by various scholars or the directors of various leading organizations and institutions, together with an account of the reactions from the fairs and conferences that have presented the author's works covers only a limited amount of material. Indeed, the scale of these reactions has been far greater than might have been expected.\nglobal impact of the works of harun yahya","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4189a97ab3d10b475be83e5aace6ff8221487c1","amp;dn":"24+Hours+In+The+Life+Of+A+Muslim.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4189a97ab3d10b475be83e5aace6ff8221487c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,24,154,151,171,61,16,180,117,190,131,229,170,206,111,248,34,20,135,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
