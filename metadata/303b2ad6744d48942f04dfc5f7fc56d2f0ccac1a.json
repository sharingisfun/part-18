Regular Team Captains are Ian Hislop and Paul Merton,\nwith Angus Deayton as host. Since Angus Deayton got fired the programme has had\nalternating hosts, which proved to be just as successful by raising viewing\nfigures by a million.\n \n Programme Notes\n \n 1. Angus Deayton was the presenter for episodes 1 to 198. He was sacked and\nfrom 199 onwards the guest presenter varies each episode.\n \n 2. Paul Merton is not in any series 11 episodes (apart from the first one\nwhere he is Ian's teammate and an extra guest is brought in) as he took a\nbreak, this is why there are three guests, instead of two (The third was to\nreplace Paul temporarily).\n \n 3. After Angus Deayton was sacked, Paul Merton was the presenter on one\noccasion. When he was presenting the programme an extra guest was brought in.\n\n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:303b2ad6744d48942f04dfc5f7fc56d2f0ccac1a","amp;dn":"Have.I.Got.News.For.You.S48E03.UNCUT.HDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"303b2ad6744d48942f04dfc5f7fc56d2f0ccac1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,59,42,214,116,77,72,148,47,4,223,197,247,252,86,210,240,204,172,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
