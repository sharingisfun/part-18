I could have chopped off the first 70 seconds and adjusted the subtitles, but I decided not to because of the information displayed during the first 10 seconds. I don't like to mess with sources unless it is absolutely necessary, and one minute isn't that significant.\n\nA fine addition to anyone's &quot;controversial films&quot; collection. Not many movies deal with D/s (Dominant/submissive) relationships. This one does. Some of the stereotypes are present in this movie, but some of the lesser known truths about D/s are in there as well. Definitely not a movie for prudes. \n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f25a91e2542458366cc965c2cf6fe01b9050dab4","amp;dn":"The+Image+%281975%29+%5B720p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f25a91e2542458366cc965c2cf6fe01b9050dab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,90,145,226,84,36,88,54,108,201,101,194,207,111,224,27,144,80,218,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
