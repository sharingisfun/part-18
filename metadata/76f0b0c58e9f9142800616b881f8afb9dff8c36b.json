He leads us on a journey of rediscovery and of extraordinary surprises behind and inside the familiar.\n\nIconic urban jungles, these cities are swarming with millions of people, their lives interdependent, their stories interconnecting.  How do they all get fed?  Where does the day start for a loaf of bread, or end for a newspaper?  Who are the people that work through the night to make London the most powerful business centre, New York the most innovative, or Paris the most indulgent?\n\n\nFor more shows from this series with Griff Rhys Jones;      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/umbraco1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/umbraco1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis program was originally uploaded by &quot;Hannibal&quot; at thebox.bz \n- theboz.bz is a private torrent tracker.
