The problem: Nan despises her. Harlow has to keep her head down if she wants to get through the next nine months, which seems easy enough. Until gorgeous Grant Carter walks out of Nan's room in nothing but his boxer briefs.\n\nGrant made a huge mistake getting involved with a girl with venom in her veins. He'd known about Nan's reputation, but still he couldn't resist her. Nothing makes him regret the fling more than meeting Harlow, who sends his pulse racing. Yet Harlow wants nothing to do with a guy who could fall for her wicked half-sister even if there are no strings between Grant and Nan. Grant is desperate to redeem himself in Harlow's eyes, but did he ruin his chances before he even met her?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66192a8cf19a3002a80067c217dbbab1473261d1","amp;dn":"Abbi+Glines+-Take+a+Chance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66192a8cf19a3002a80067c217dbbab1473261d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,25,42,140,241,154,48,2,168,0,103,194,23,219,186,177,71,50,97,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
