It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore great TV Shows &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://publichash.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://publichash.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b07b825279ee7e8238913c9a2d9ae11d39163189","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.2005.S07E08.Cold.War.HDTV.x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b07b825279ee7e8238913c9a2d9ae11d39163189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,123,130,82,121,238,126,130,56,145,60,154,45,154,225,29,57,22,49,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
