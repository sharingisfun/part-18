For his punishment, the fellow is sent to the Chinese front. He goes there and finds that his brother was killed for desertion. This enrages the soldier who explodes and finds himself in deeper trouble, and he is faced with a difficult choice: he can either be court-martialed, or he can perform a kamikaze mission. He chooses the latter, and along with a cadre of freed prisoners, must capture a Chinese fort. They do succeed in their mission, but unfortunately the brave fighters are overpowered by the sheer numbers of the Chinese who continually bombard the fortress.\n\n\nVideo\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 1.37 GiB\nDuration : 2h 11mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 483 Kbps\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nBit rate : 1 029 Kbps\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.222\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.233\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 2h 11mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f0f489c8bc1c63295f034a4c61b6256940acf7","amp;dn":"Fort+Graveyard+%5BChi+to+Suna%5D%5B1965%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f0f489c8bc1c63295f034a4c61b6256940acf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,240,244,137,200,188,28,99,41,95,3,74,76,97,182,37,105,64,172,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
