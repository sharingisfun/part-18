Though that album's dark blend of New Orleans rhythms and outrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© production techniques made it a `60s counter-culture favorite, it drew from a much more venerable set of musical traditions. On 1992's Goin' Back To New Orleans, Dr. John takes his audience on a guided tour of New Orleans jazz and r&amp;b, assaying memorable covers of beloved standards like W.C. Handy's &quot;Careless Love&quot; and more obscure numbers like Jelly Roll Morton's &quot;I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say.&quot; Dr. John and his accompanists, including a plethora of New Orleans music luminaries, give these numbers compelling and authoritative readings. This album is a fascinating slice of New Orleans history that also sheds light on the origins of Dr. John's inimitable aesthetic.\n\nRecorded at Ultrasonic Studios, New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nTracklist \n1.
