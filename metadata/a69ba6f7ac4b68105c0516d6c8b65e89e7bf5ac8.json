Dance No. 2\n2. 1. Knee Play No. 4 from Einstein on the Beach\n3. 2. Act 3 conclusion from Satyagraha\n4. 3. Dance from Act 3 of Akhnaten\n5. Dance No. 4 \n\n\nThe fact that Philip Glass' music stands up so well in a variety of arrangements is a testament to its durability. German composer and pianist/organist Steffen Schleiermacher offers a recital of two dances from Dance, Glass' monumental 1979 multimedia collaboration with choreographer Lucinda Childs and visual artist Sol Lewitt, arranged for organ, and Sonata, a transcription for piano of one section from each of Glass' three portrait operas, made by Paul Barnes. The dances, which frame the Sonata on the CD, are especially effective when performed on the organ, due to the grandeur of which the organ is capable, its ability to sustain notes without decay, and the fact that its sound is closely related to the electronic keyboards used in the original.\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a69ba6f7ac4b68105c0516d6c8b65e89e7bf5ac8","amp;dn":"Philip+Glass+-+Dances+and+Sonata+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a69ba6f7ac4b68105c0516d6c8b65e89e7bf5ac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,155,166,247,172,75,104,16,92,5,22,214,200,182,94,137,231,191,90,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
