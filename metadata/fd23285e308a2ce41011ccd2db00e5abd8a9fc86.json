Fans of &quot;Life with Derek&quot; will know Joy as Nora MacDonald on the half-hour sitcom. \n\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Jan 3, 2010. According to the CBC website, the next 4 new episodes will air consecutively each Sunday (from Jan 10 to Jan 31, 2009). \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd23285e308a2ce41011ccd2db00e5abd8a9fc86","amp;dn":"Heartland.S03E10.Eye.of.the.Wolf.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd23285e308a2ce41011ccd2db00e5abd8a9fc86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,35,40,94,48,138,44,228,16,17,204,210,219,0,229,171,216,169,252,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
