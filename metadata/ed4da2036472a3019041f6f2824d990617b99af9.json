Sharrie became instantly captivated by powerful vocalists that had a dynamic stage presence - Billie Holiday, Tina Turner, Ruth Brown, Etta James and Koko Taylor.\nSharrie began to perform frequently throughout the 1990's with her band and instantly knew that this was what she wanted to do with her life enabling her to perfect her stage act and bringing her to wider audiences in the midwestern United States.\nSince 2001, Sharrie has become well known overseas, where she has performed in over 15 countries and has entertained at the very best clubs and prestigious festivals largely in support of her Hard Drivin' Woman CD.
