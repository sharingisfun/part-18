It is clear, therefore, that even a school course of mathematics cannot be studied seriously without mastering this method. Ideas of mathematical induction, moreover, have a wide general significance and acquaintance with them also has an importance for those whose interests are far removed from mathematics and its applications. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beeaad427e118d7d523ec4e337b4506c8204d680","amp;dn":"The+Method+of+Mathematical+Induction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beeaad427e118d7d523ec4e337b4506c8204d680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,234,173,66,126,17,141,125,82,62,196,227,55,180,80,108,130,4,214,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
