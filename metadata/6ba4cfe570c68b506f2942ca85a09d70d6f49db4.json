The authors,  using  a  time-honored straightforward  and\nflexible  approach,  present  the  basic concepts  and  principles  of\nmechanics  in the  clearest  and simplest  form  possible to  advanced\nundergraduate   engineering  students   of  various   disciplines  and\ndifferent educational backgrounds.\n\nAn  important objective  of this  book is  to develop  problem solving\nskills  in a  systematic  manner. Another  aim of  this  volume is  to\nprovide engineering  students as well  as practicing engineers  with a\nsolid foundation  to help  them bridge  the gap  between undergraduate\nstudies  on the  one hand  and  advanced courses  on mechanics  and/or\npractical engineering problems on the other.\n\nThe  book  contains  numerous  examples,  along  with  their  complete\nsolutions. Emphasis  is placed  upon student participation  in problem\nsolving. The  contents of the  book correspond to the  topics normally\ncovered in courses on basic  engineering mechanics at universities and\ncolleges.\n\nNow in its  second English edition, this material has  been in use for\ntwo  decades  in  Germany,  and  has  benefited  from  many  practical\nimprovements and the authors' teaching  experience over the years. New\nto this edition are the  extra supplementary examples available online\nas well as the TM-tools necessary to work with this method.\n\n\nRef: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=3642303196&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=3642303196&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=3642128866&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=3642128866&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=364214019X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=364214019X&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ba4cfe570c68b506f2942ca85a09d70d6f49db4","amp;dn":"Engineering+Mechanics+%283+Vols%29+-+Dietmar+Gross+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ba4cfe570c68b506f2942ca85a09d70d6f49db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,164,207,229,112,198,139,80,111,41,66,202,133,160,157,112,214,244,157,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
