Comprehensive and forward thinking, these books offer a valuable guide to both cellular processes while inciting researchers to explore their potentially important connections.\n\nConsidering that autophagy is associated with numerous biological processes, including cellular development and differentiation, cancer (both antitumor and protumor functions), immunity, infectious diseases, inflammation, maintenance of homeostasis, response to cellular stress, and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases, there is a great need to understanding its role. Cell homeostasis is achieved by balancing biosynthesis and cellular turnover. In spite of the increasing importance of autophagy in various pathophysiological situations (conditions) mentioned above, this process remains underestimated and overlooked. As a consequence, its role in the initiation, stability, maintenance, and progression of these and other diseases (e.g., autoimmune disease) remains poorly understood.\n\nPresents the most advanced information regarding the role of the autophagic system in life and death and whether autophagy acts fundamentally as a cell survivor or cell death pathway or both\nIntroduces new, more effective therapeutic strategies in the development of targeted drugs and programmed cell death, providing information that will aid on preventing detrimental inflammation\nStates recent advancements in the molecular mechanisms underlying a large number of genetic and epigenetic diseases and abnormalities\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nDr. Hayat has published extensively in the fields of microscopy, cytology, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and antigen retrieval methods. He is Distinguished Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Kean University, Union, New Jersey, USA.\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a7972419bb8e3fb3a4b1f4b8ac838286d684002","amp;dn":"Autophagy%3A+Cancer%2C+Other+Pathologies%2C+Inflammation%2C+Immunity%2C+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a7972419bb8e3fb3a4b1f4b8ac838286d684002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,121,114,65,155,184,227,251,58,75,31,75,138,200,56,40,109,104,64,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
