Instead, members Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow, Walter Parazaider,\nJason Scheff, Lou Pardini, Tris Imboden, Keith Howland and Drew Hester treat us to 14 Christmas\nand holiday favorites that have been &quot;Chicagoized&quot; with that famous sound we've all come to\nknow and enjoy since the late 1960s.\n\n&quot;O Christmas Three&quot; will thrill longtime Chicago fans and will probably enlist many more who\nare simply looking for a wonderful holiday recording.\n\nFrom the jazzy &quot;It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot;\nto the rocking &quot;On The Last Night Of The Year&quot; and &quot;Rockin' and Rollin' On Christmas Day,&quot;\nChicago XXXIII is a nonstop holiday musical treat that is performed to typical CHICAGO perfection.\n\nSolid vocals by Lamm, Scheff, Pardini, Loughnane and Howland are supported by hard hitting\nbrass runs and licks by the force known as Pankow, Parazaider and Loughnane.\n\nGuest performances by artists Dolly Parton, America, Steve Cropper and BeBe Winans add to\nthe holiday spirit as if CHICAGO simply invited some of their musical friends and us over\nfor some hot chocolate and a cozy, warm fire.\n\nChicago XXXIII has definitely become one of &quot;My Favorite Things!&quot;\n\n\n\n   1.
