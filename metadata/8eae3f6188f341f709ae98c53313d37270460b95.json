In the old ACM Curriculum Guidelines, this course was known as CS7. This text is for readers who want to learn good programming and algorithm analysis skills simultaneously so that they can develop such programs with the maximum amount of efficiency. Readers should have some knowledge of intermediate programming, including topics as object-based programming and recursion, and some background in discrete math.\n\nAs the speed and power of computers increases, so does the need for effective programming and algorithm analysis. By approaching these skills in tandem, Mark Allen Weiss teaches readers to develop well-constructed, maximally efficient programs in Java.\n\nWeiss clearly explains topics from binary heaps to sorting to NP-completeness, and dedicates a full chapter to amortized analysis and advanced data structures and their implementation. Figures and examples illustrating successive stages of algorithms contribute to WeissÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ careful, rigorous and in-depth analysis of each type of algorithm. A logical organization of topics and full access to source code complement the textÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coverage.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nMark Allen Weiss provides a proven approach to algorithms and data structures using the exciting Java programming language as the implementation tool. With Java he highlights conceptual topics, focusing on ADTs and the analysis of algorithms for efficiency as well as performance and running time. Dr. Weiss also distinguishes this text with a logical organization of topics, his engaging writing style, and an extensive use of figures and examples showing the successive stages of an algorithm.\n\nFeatures\n\nContains extensive sample code using Java 1.2, which is available over the Internet.\nCovers the Java Collections Library in an appendix.\nIncludes a chapter on algorithm and design techniques that covers greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming,\nrandomized algorithms, and backtracking.\nPresents current topics and new data structures such as Fibonacci heaps, skew heaps, binomial queues, skip lists, and splay trees.\nOffers a chapter on amortized analysis that examines the advanced data structures presented earlier in the book.\nProvides a chapter on advanced data structures and their implementation, covering red-black trees, top-down splay trees, treaps, k-d trees, pairing heaps, and more.\nBook Details\nHardcover: 576 pages\nPublisher: Addison Wesley; 3rd Edition (November 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0132576279\nISBN-13: 978-0132576277","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eae3f6188f341f709ae98c53313d37270460b95","amp;dn":"Addison.Wesley.Data.Structures.and.Algorithm.Analysis.in.Java.3r","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eae3f6188f341f709ae98c53313d37270460b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,174,63,97,136,243,65,247,9,174,152,197,51,19,211,114,112,70,11,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
