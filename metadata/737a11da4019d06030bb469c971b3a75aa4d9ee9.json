They're simply too cute for words, and just right for intermediate-level crocheters. Helpful instructions teach all the necessary specialty stitches and explain how to master such techniques as crocheting 3-dimensional forms. The projects (organized by theme) feature adorable images and lots of time-tested tips. And each one is simply irresistible: a lion hooded jacket with a fuzzy yarn mane and matching mitten paws, a Heidi hat with a folk design and fake yarns braids peeking out the sides, and a dress-up royal purple cape and bejeweled crown. There's no collection like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:737a11da4019d06030bb469c971b3a75aa4d9ee9","amp;dn":"Too+Cute+Crochet+for+Babies+and+Toddlers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"737a11da4019d06030bb469c971b3a75aa4d9ee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,122,17,218,64,25,208,96,48,187,70,156,151,27,58,117,170,77,158,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
