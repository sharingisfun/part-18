He died in a fire at his home but it is not clear if the fire was \nset deliberately, so the team analyse the severely burned body without knowing the \ncause of the fire.\n\nWarner had recently been visited by one of his old clients - Joseph Marial, an \nasylum seeker from Sudan, who had been deported a year earlier after he was found \nguilty of assault. Warner defended him, but was unable to get him acquitted. \nWarners son, Nick, is convinced that Joseph must be responsible, but there appears \nto be no proof.\n\nIn a race against time, Oggy, Mike and the team reconstruct the fire in their lab \nto try and establish more information about the fire that killed Warner. Their \nfindings bring fresh evidence to light.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/P1Zks.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/P1Zks.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 581 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 390 Kbps\nDuration: 58mn 43s\nSample: NO\nSubtitles External:NO\n\n::Video Info::\n\nContainer: avc\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 1 200 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16.9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.167\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: (oan).Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 208 Kbps ((( Stereo )))\nMaximum Bitrate: 576 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels [Front: L R]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6a630bd907d4903526dc11178da6fdb1b75b6b9","amp;dn":"BBC+-+The+Body+Farm+2011+5+of+6+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6a630bd907d4903526dc11178da6fdb1b75b6b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,166,48,189,144,125,73,3,82,109,193,17,120,218,111,219,27,117,182,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
