In recent years, a new community of people who want alternative energies for their cars, public vehicles, and houses has emerged. &quot;Renewable Energy&quot; reviews the current status of technologies in renewable energy, a critical subject since the world now increases its energy consumption between 1 to 3 percent each year. Covering the current rate of energy consumption and the consequences of continuing this rate, this new book explains how the main conventional forms of energy - including coal, oil, and gas - contribute to economies. The focus of this full-color book is the remarkable diversity of ideas that are born every day in the field of alternative energy. \nThe chapters include:\nEarth's Energy Sources; \nRecycling\nGasoline Alternative Vehicles\nBiorefineries\nInnovations in Clean Energy\nGreen Building Design and\nEnergy from Solid Biomass.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:717663062ed338eeaf674d1344cc64b13e380542","amp;dn":"Renewable+Energy+-+Sources+and+Methods+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"717663062ed338eeaf674d1344cc64b13e380542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,118,99,6,46,211,56,238,175,103,77,19,68,204,100,177,62,56,5,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
