ENJoY!\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally released in 1983 as Rhythms of the Grasslands: Music of Upper Volta, Volume II \n\nIn order to provide a historical context for this recording, the liner notes that accompanied its original release have been reprinted in full below. The text has not been edited to reflect changes in general cultural perceptions or specific factual information that may have occurred since then.\n\nA series of military coups in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to the rise of Captain Thomas Sankara as the leader of Upper Volta in 1983. A Marxist, Sankara worked towards domestic social and economic reform. At the same time, he severed connections to his countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s colonial past by aligning with Communist states abroad. Furthermore, in 1984, the name Upper Volta was shed in favor of Burkina Faso, which, through a combination of words in two of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s main languages, means ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe land of incorruptible/upright men.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nSankara was assassinated in 1987, allowing his closest ally, \nCaptain Blaise CompaorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, to seize control. Through single- and \nmulti-party elections in the 1990s, CompaorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and his party have \nmaintained control of the government ever since. They have worked \nto reverse the trends set by his predecessor, seeking the assistance \nof the World Bank and the international community at large.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ed.\n\n\n\nUpper VoltaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 105,869 square miles of semi-desert savannah plains in \nthe heart of West Africa contain nearly six million people divided into \nover 50 distinct ethnic groups, speaking as many an languages. Centuries \nof traditional farming and nomadic cattle herding have provided the \npeople with the expertise to subsist on marginal resources, and left \nthem with a heritage of survival in a harsh environment. This album \npresents samples of the music of Upper Volta from several converging \nperspectives: cultural, musical, and social.\n\nUpper Volta may be divided into three major cultural areas reflecting \ngeneral differences in lifestyle, customs, language and music. The \nVoltaic area, in the central and eastern part of the country, is the \nlargest. The countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s three million Mossi live there. Musical \ntraditions reflect both the indigenous religious contexts and the court \nmusic sustaining the prestige of prominent political lineages.\n\nMusically speaking, this area is strong in drumming traditions, including \ncylindrical wood and spherical gourd and pressure drums, the tone of which \nmay be altered by squeezing or releasing the strings that connect the heads \nstretched over the ends of the hour-glass-shaped body. Solo lute and fiddle \nmusic also occur, as do ensembles of oblique flutes. Xylophones are found \nin the western Voltaic cultural area.\n\nIn the northern Sahel region the music traditions of nomadic herding groups \nsuch as the Fulani, Bella and Toureg are heard. The instruments are light \nand portable and may have other practical uses. Hand clapping with bracelets \nalso provides rhythmic accompaniment. Other instruments include lutes, \nfiddles, transverse and oblique end-blown flutes, but drums are rarely found \nhere. The music reflects Islamic influences from North Africa carried across \nthe Sahara with the trade caravans.\n\nThe MandÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© cultural area of western Upper Volta comprises the eastern extension \nof a larger MandÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© cultural area that spreads westward across West Africa \nthrough southern Mali, Northern Sierra Leone, and into northern Guinea, \nGambia and Senegal. The origins of this large cultural grouping trace back \nto the Mali Empire of the 14th century. Instruments that are common in \nthis area include harp-lutes, fiddles, lutes, xylophones, musical bows and \nconical, cylindrical, and pressure drum ensembles. More emphasis is placed \non solo singing.\n\n- KATHLEEN JOHNSON, 1983\nCredits\n\nPRODUCTION CREDITS\nRecorded 1973ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“75 in Upper Volta by Kathleen Johnson\nEditing: John Howell, Library of Congress\nMastered by Michele Stone, Elektra Sound Recorders\nProduction Coordinator: Elise Keen\nDirector: Keith Holzman\nRe-mastered by Robert C.
