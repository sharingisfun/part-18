Created by scientist Dr. William &quot;Will&quot; Magnus, the six robots were field leader Gold, strong man Iron, slow-witted and loyal Lead, hot-headed Mercury, self-doubting and insecure Tin, and Platinum (also called &quot;Tina&quot;), who believed she was a real woman and was in love with her creator. The group's personalities mirrored their namesake metals, being dictated by devices called &quot;responsometers&quot;. Each Metal Man also possessed abilities that reflected the traits of their namesake metal: Gold could stretch his form almost infinitely, Iron was super strong, Lead could block harmful radiation by morphing into thick shields, Mercury could melt and pass through small spaces before reforming and Platinum could stretch, flatten or spin herself into long filaments. The robot heroes were all destroyed in the story, since no further need for them was foreseen at the time.\n\nThough the Metal Men story was meant as a One-shot filler, the characters featured in the following three issues of Showcase (#38 - 40, June. Aug. &amp; Oct. 1962) and proved popular enough to warrant a reappearance in their own eponymous title. First published in May, 1963, the title ran on a bi-monthly schedule with original stories until Metal Men #41 (Dec. 1969). A second female robot (created by Tin) was introduced in issue #13 (AprilÃ¢â‚¬â€œMay 1965), and she was later (issue #15, AugustÃ¢â‚¬â€œSeptember 1965) christened as &quot;Nameless&quot;, last appearing in issue #32.[4] Her disappearance was unexplained until Brave &amp; the Bold #87. In issue #33 the direction of the comic changed from light-hearted pseudo-science to suspense &amp; tragedy, as Dr. Magnus was put in a coma by a lab accident, and mankind turned against the Metal Men, finally forcing them in #37 to assume human identities: Guy Gilden, (Wall St. financier), Leadby Hand and Tinker (musicians), Tina Platt (fashion model), Mercurio (artist), and &quot;Iron Man&quot; Munro (construction foreman). The series ended with issue #41 in 1970, with the &quot;Dr. Magnus, terrorist&quot; plotline unresolved. The Metal Men lost their appeal by looking like humans and wearing street clothes.\n\nThe series returned three years later in 1973 with three experimental reprint issues (Issues #42, 43, and 44 (March, May and July 1973)) of earlier Showcase appearances and the first issue, with the title then on hiatus until returning with original numbering in issue #45 (May 1976), with Dr. Magnus regaining enough sanity to become responsible for his creations again, when they all perish from the radiation fury of Plutonium Man. The bi-monthly publishing schedule continued until issue #56 (March 1978), when the title and many others were cancelled due to the DC Implosion.\n\nThe Metal Men co-starred with other DC heroes such as Atom, Metamorpho and Batman in The Brave and the Bold #55 (Sept. 1964), #66 (July 1966), #74 (Nov. 1967), #103 (Nov. 1972), #113 (July 1974), #121 (Sept. 1975), #135-136 (July-Sept. 1977) and #187 (June 1982). This trend was repeated with Superman in DC Comics Presents #4 (Dec. 1978) and #70 (June 1984), followed by an appearance in Showcase #100 (May 1978).\n \nThis series is remembered for it's brief but fantastic art by artist, Walter Simonson and it's acclaimed story by Steve Gerber in issue #45, that is highly praised by legendary writer, Grant Morrison.\n\nMetal Men #1-6 (2007-2008): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4035419/Metal_Men_1-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4035419/Metal_Men_1-6&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCollection of most of the Metal Men special appearances: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4035404/Metal_Men_Various&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4035404/Metal_Men_Various&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3da35fa33916e4e52db6e639308b9bd9b2134b4e","amp;dn":"Metal+Men+v1+%231-56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3da35fa33916e4e52db6e639308b9bd9b2134b4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,163,95,163,57,22,228,229,45,182,230,57,48,139,155,217,178,19,75,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
