The enjoyable voice of Seagrave blissfully adds a unique touch to this song. A haunting beat and crispy melodies introduce &quot;H2O&quot;, and the combination of gorgeous pad layers and piano lines carefully carries the track to its completion. &quot;Void&quot; quickly establishes a darker and energetic soundscape. It features a mesmerizing vocal stem, energy-filled pad layers, and many intriguing arpeggio leads. A gorgeous atmosphere is introduced in &quot;Mountains&quot;, and Seagrave's voice once again flows really well with the enjoyable pad and percussion structures. &quot;Solar Flare&quot; begins with quite unique percussion and sound effects, and a powerful, well-crafted bassline adds extra texture later. &quot;Winter Dust&quot; continues in the same style, where darker melodies and sound effects dominate the soundscape. A hypnotizing aura introduces &quot;Ember&quot;, and the song features intriguing synth layers and percussion elements that unite beautifully. Last but not least is &quot;Tick Tock&quot;, which was recently released as a single with two interpretations from Jani R.\n It is a calm, inspiring outro tune, which perfectly encapsulates Seagrave's talents in the chillout and downtempo genres.\n\n=======================================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38fcd359363ac3544b45f6f0822b10db181b0347","amp;dn":"Seagrave+-+Seagrave+%282014%29+Album+%2F+ChillOut+%40+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38fcd359363ac3544b45f6f0822b10db181b0347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,252,211,89,54,58,195,84,75,69,246,240,130,43,16,219,24,27,3,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
