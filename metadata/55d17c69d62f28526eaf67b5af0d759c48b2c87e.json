But he acquits himself most competently here, mixing blues, funk, R&amp;B, and a little jazz into his sparkling fretwork. His brother Floyd Murphy, a Memphis blues guitar legend himself, is on hand for a family reunion.\n\n\nTrack List:\n1. Way Down South\n2. Big Six\n3. Gonna Be Some Changes Made\n4.
