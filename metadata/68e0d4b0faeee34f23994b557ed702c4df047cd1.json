Former CIA director Leon Panetta describes how Obama decides to go ahead despite odds no better than 50:50 and the strong misgivings of top advisors.\r\n\r\nAs his re-election campaign gears up, Obama has to make a tough choice on contraception - whether to side with the Catholic bishops, or health secretary Kathleen Sebelius and feminist activists. Obama chooses the women and they contribute to his convincing election victory.\r\n\r\nBut soon after his re-election, America is shocked by the Sandy Hook massacre - 20 children are shot dead in a Connecticut school. The families of the victims and senior advisor Valerie Jarrett recall the president's attempts to strengthen gun legislation but they are defeated by the gun lobby.\r\n\r\nObama's other ambitious reforms fared no better. Cecilia MuÃ±oz and Valerie Jarrett reveal how Obama worked with allies in Congress to create a bipartisan consensus on immigration but is defeated by the Republicans. The president can move forward only through executive action.\r\n\r\nThe background of the first black president is different from most African Americans'. Raised in Hawaii by white grandparents, Obama initially downplays racial issues but the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin provokes him to speak out. When Ferguson, Missouri, becomes a flash point of conflict between police and African Americans, Obama urges young activists to channel their anger into progressive change.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 021 MiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 35s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 396 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 2 300 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68e0d4b0faeee34f23994b557ed702c4df047cd1","amp;dn":"BBC+Inside+Obamas+White+House+4of4+The+Arc+of+History+720p+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68e0d4b0faeee34f23994b557ed702c4df047cd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,224,212,176,250,238,227,79,35,153,75,85,126,215,2,196,223,4,124,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
