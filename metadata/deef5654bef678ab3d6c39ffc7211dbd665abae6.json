Just as the cameras rolled on that day, veteran filmmaker Anthony Thomas returns to China 17 years later to recall the importance of this defiance.\n\nIn the search for ?The Tank Man? Thomas draws on interviews with Chinese and Western eyewitnesses and recounts the amazing events that preceded the resistance and the massacre of ordinary people in Tiananmen Square.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the massacre, students protested over the hardships, government corruption and 40 year?s under repression communist government rule. Soon attitudes hardened and tens of millions openly demonstrated against the country?s military surrounding Tiananmen Square.\n\n?The move from student uprising to a worker uprising is what really scared the Chinese Government.? ? Jim Laurie, Former ABC Foreign Correspondent.\n\nThe protesters including Navy personnel, doctors, wives and children all took to the streets to seek reform not revolution. As the army closed in from four different military districts in China, order was given to clear Tiananmen Square by 6.00am on June 4. Tens of thousands of people were arrested, unknown numbers died from shootings, more were later executed and some still remain in prison.\n\n?If you have ever seen security people man-handle a Chinese citizen, they are really brutal.? ? Jan Wong, the Global and Mail, Toronto.\n\nYears down the track students of Beijing University have no recollection or understanding when shown a photograph of ?The Tank Man?. The embarrassment for the government to have shed so many lives led to strict censorship of the media, limiting the evidence even in overseas-owned online resources.\n\n?Leading US companies such as Yahoo, Cisco, Google and Microsoft have compromised both the integrity of their product and their duties as responsible corporate citizens.? - Rep. Christopher Smith, New Jersey.\n\nSince the heroic stand of ?The Tank Man? China has changed beyond recognition. The identity and fate of ?The Tank Man? still remains a mystery but the symbolism he represents has provided enduring power for man kind. \n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Tianamen.Square.-.The.Tank.Man.2006.TVRip.XviD.avi\nFilesize.....: 696 MB (or 713,694 KB or 730,822,656 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:52:37 (157,871 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1725 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 115 kb/s (57/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97b\u0002Ã‚Âª\nFrame Size...: 608x352 (1.73:1) [=19:11]\nLanguage.....: English\n\n\ned2k://|file|Tianamen.Square.-.The.Tank.Man.2006.TVRip.XviD.avi|730822656|D01085E210494B69DD5CD5F1742CEA2E|/\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deef5654bef678ab3d6c39ffc7211dbd665abae6","amp;dn":"Tianamen+Square+-+The+Tank+Man+%282006%29+SBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deef5654bef678ab3d6c39ffc7211dbd665abae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,239,86,84,190,246,120,171,61,108,57,255,199,33,29,189,102,90,186,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
