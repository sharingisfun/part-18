Liverpool have been scoring for fun this season, and hope to add to their impressive tally at home to Tottenham, against whom they scored five without reply at White Hart Lane earlier this season.\n\nElsewhere, Everton travel to Fulham, who they defeated 4-1 in December. But the Cottagers, who have changed managers again since then, did beat Roberto Martinez's side in the League Cup back in September. They are hoping to recreate that winning feeling and earn three points, which could be vital in their battle for Premier League survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff31b7e7e0d22ad8c0ca03544f9511c8082966a","amp;dn":"Match.Of.The.Day.Two.2014.03.30.720p.HDTV.x264-FTP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff31b7e7e0d22ad8c0ca03544f9511c8082966a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,243,27,126,126,13,34,173,140,12,160,53,68,249,81,28,128,130,150,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
