Hardy teamed up with producer/director Leila Sansour and other members of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) in an effort to try his hand at ending occupation of the West Bank. Hardy could only describe the next four days of filming as &quot;four days in hell&quot;.\n\nThe footage  captured covers everything from the standoff at Yasser Arafat&amp;#039;s compound to the siege at the Church of the Nativity. It gives an inside look into the operations and birth of the ISM and the stories that were never reported in last year&amp;#039;s news bulletins.\n\nThree  previous screenings of the film at the Bloomsbury have attracted more than 1800 people- the phenomenal response from audiences means Jeremy Hardy v. the Israeli Army now stands as one of a handful of documentaries to make it to cinemas around the UK, responding to the growing appetite for political engagement, independent film making and the growing interest in the International Solidarity Movement.\n\nProduced by Asparagus Films in association with Diva Pictures\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393396/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393396/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29018d064b95a293ec8fed40f8b8af2bada6fd93","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Hardy+vs+the+Israeli+Army","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29018d064b95a293ec8fed40f8b8af2bada6fd93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,1,141,6,75,149,162,147,236,143,237,64,248,184,175,43,173,166,253,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
