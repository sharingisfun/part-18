Eisenhower the soldier, bestselling historian Stephen E. Ambrose examines the Allied commanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership during World War II.\n \nAmbrose brings EisenhowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience of the Second World War to life, showing in vivid detail how the generalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skill as a diplomat and a military strategist contributed to Allied successes in North Africa and in Europe, and established him as one of the greatest military leaders in the world. Ambrose, then the Associate Editor of the GeneralÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official papers, analyzes EisenhowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult military decisions and his often complicated relationships with powerful personalities like Churchill, de Gaulle, Roosevelt, and Patton. This is the definitive account of EisenhowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evolution as a military leaderÃ¢â‚¬â€from its dramatic beginnings through his time at the top post of Allied command.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9cb5611dfa6a3d3e26336bce3d55929cafb32c","amp;dn":"The+Supreme+Commander+-+Stephen+Ambrose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9cb5611dfa6a3d3e26336bce3d55929cafb32c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,156,181,97,29,250,106,61,62,38,51,107,206,61,85,146,156,175,179,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
