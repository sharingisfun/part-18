Charlene Lee  \n  Bruce Davison  ...  Rodney Bingham  \n  Lee Grant  ...  Amalia Stark  \n  Devon Gummersall  ...  Andrew Bingham  \n  Gregory Harrison  ...  Brandon Theis  \n  Marlee Matlin  ...  Daphne Stark  \n  Roddy McDowall  ...  Damian Knowles  \n  Olivia Newton-John  ...  Lina Bingham  \n  Bronson Pinchot  ...  Monty Tipton  \n  Paul Regina  ...  Tony Zamara  \n  George Segal  ...  Paul Stark  \n  Eric Roberts  ...  Nick Stark  \n  Steve Antin  ...  Zack Phillips  \n  Dimitra Arliss  ...  Fanny Kondos  \n  Christopher Atkins  ...  Jack Allen  \n\nThe film is based on the true events of the death of Harry Stein, accomplished architect and designer, who was actually director Kleiser's ex-lover. Stein's actual farewell party was held in 1992.\n\nThe cast includes Olivia Newton-John, Margaret Cho, Bronson Pinchot, Devon Gummersall, George Segal, Lee Grant, Marlee Matlin, Roddy McDowall, Steve Antin, Bruce Davison, Sally Kellerman, Lou Liberatore, Nina Foch, the dreamy Eric Roberts as Nick Stark and 80s man meat Gregory Harrison as Brandon, Stark's estranged lover who returns to attend the party and say goodbye. Kleiser directed Newton-John in Grease almost 20 years earlier.\n\nIt's My Party is an outstanding ensemble effort, with plenty of laughter, drama, and pathos to go around. Watch Kleiser's long tracking takes and he moves the camera indoors and out, through room after room, dropping in and out of conversations. The commentary reveals just how hard it was for him to pull this labor of love together, shooting around his large cast's schedules and trying to maintain continuity of everything from wardrobe to the length of burning candles over a period of more than a year. Roberts and Harrison really shine (this is one of Roberts' few really human performances), and the supporting cast gives effortless, almost improv-like performances, too. It's a powerful experience.\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba9eda4c0bf13f66f62bc454380eee2c73535834","amp;dn":"It%5C%27s+My+Party+%28eng+subs%29++%5B1996%5D+Eric+Roberts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba9eda4c0bf13f66f62bc454380eee2c73535834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,158,218,76,11,241,63,102,246,43,196,84,56,14,238,44,115,83,88,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
