Though they'd as soon cut each other's throats than cooperate, Zack and Joe are forced to unite against a pair of common enemies: crooked banker Harvey Burden (played by Victor Buono, a favorite of director Robert Aldrich) and cold-blooded outlaw/hired-gun Matson (Charles Bronson, virtually the only person in the film who takes his role seriously). The heroes also battle over the affections of well-endowed heroines Elya Carlson (Anita Ekberg) and Maxine Richter (Ursula Andress), both of whom are sharp-witted businesswomen who match Zack and Joe scam for scam. The Three Stooges show up for a moment, in which they repeat their &quot;point to the right&quot; and &quot;State of Texas&quot; routines, and get into a fracas with feisty little old lady Jesslyn Fax. Also making guest appearances are Arthur Godfrey and Teddy Buckner and His All Stars. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057071/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057071/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSubs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-16816&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-16816&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:55:09\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x400 1.80:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1215 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e3e1de7e7bd36b6dab53f68f2d1e3e23a7b56ed","amp;dn":"4+for+Texas+%281963%29+Frank+Sinatra+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e3e1de7e7bd36b6dab53f68f2d1e3e23a7b56ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,62,29,231,231,189,54,182,218,181,63,104,242,209,227,226,58,123,86,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
