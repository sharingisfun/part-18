This reader-friendly book begins \nwith an overview of basic electricity concepts rather than introducing \ncomplex mathematical calculations. From this starting point, readers proceed \ndirectly to &quot;must-know&quot; information, including how to determine wire sizes \nand make a variety of common switch connections. Different types of electrical \npower panels are also examined in detail. Discussion of general wiring \npractices and circuit protectors, as well as an introduction to transformers \nand three-phase and single-phase motors, round out the comprehensive coverage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909637b5028d9919bc730617758a16867c03e332","amp;dn":"Cencage+Electrical+Studies+for+Trades+5th+Edition+2013+Retail+eB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909637b5028d9919bc730617758a16867c03e332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,150,55,181,2,141,153,25,188,115,6,23,117,138,22,134,124,3,227,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
