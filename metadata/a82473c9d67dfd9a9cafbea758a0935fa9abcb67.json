Two experienced Finnish players have described an exciting repertoire based on the move 1...d6 in reply to whatever White's first move happens to be. Black's strategy is hypermodern and dynamic: White is encouraged to seize space, while Black develops his pieces rapidly and actively, waiting for the ideal moment to attack and destroy White's central bastions. The variations advocated have been proven in top-level play and have quick-strike potential if White is at all careless or imprecise. The repertoire is based around the Pirc Defence and the variations 1 d4 d6 2 c4 e5 and 1 d4 d6 2 Nf3 Bg4, which fit seamlessly together with 1...d6 systems against White's various flank openings.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a82473c9d67dfd9a9cafbea758a0935fa9abcb67","amp;dn":"An+Explosive+Chess+Opening+Repertoire+for+Black","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a82473c9d67dfd9a9cafbea758a0935fa9abcb67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,36,115,201,214,125,253,154,156,175,190,167,88,160,147,95,169,171,203,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
