It will be a concept album based on a single episode from Finland's national epic, the Kalevala. The album is scheduled for release on May 27, 2009 in Finland and May 29, 2009 in Europe. The North American release is scheduled to be during the summer. Guitarist Esa Holopainen states the album is their most musical record so far.\n\nAlong with their two previous albums, Eclipse and Silent Waters, Skyforger was recorded at Sonic Pump Studios in Helsinki. The cover of the album bears a striking resemblance to that of A Static Lullaby's album Faso Latido.\n\nSkyforger will be released as a limited digipak edition, containing &quot;Godlike Machine&quot; as a bonus track. &quot;Silver Bride&quot; was released as a Finland-only single on April 22, 2009 and topped the Finnish single charts. The music video for the single premiered on May 11, directed by Owe Lingvall.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.
