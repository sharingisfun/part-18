It was their last album before their break they had between 2003 and 2005. This is the last EToS album to feature keyboardist Pasi Hiltula (who had been in the band since early 1999) and the only album to feature guitarist Antti Kokko.\n\nThe seventh song on the album, &quot;Sick, Dirty and Mean&quot; is a cover song, originally written and performed by Accept. The band had rehearsed the song for a two-part tribute album (Tribute to Accept vol. 1 &amp; 2) in 1999 but didn't have any extra time to record it. So, they decided to include the song on A Virgin and a Whore.\n\nThe album cover art was made by Niklas Sundin of Cabin Fever Media and guitarist of Dark Tranquillity.\n\nContentsTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tLyrics \tMusic \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Aurora Borealis&quot;   \tVetelÃƒÂ¤inen &amp; Puolakanaho \tHiltula &amp; Puolakanaho &amp; VetelÃƒÂ¤inen \t5:04\n2. \t&quot;Heart of Wilderness&quot;   \tVetelÃƒÂ¤inen &amp; Puolakanaho \tKokko &amp; Hiltula \t3:40\n3. \t&quot;Prophetian&quot;   \tVetelÃƒÂ¤inen &amp; Puolakanaho &amp; Sankala \tHiltula &amp; Puolakanaho &amp; Kokko \t5:24\n4. \t&quot;Fall of Man&quot;   \tPuolakanaho &amp; VetelÃƒÂ¤inen \tPuolakanaho &amp; Hiltula \t4:58\n5. \t&quot;The River Flows Frozen&quot;   \tVetelÃƒÂ¤inen &amp; Kokko &amp; Puolakanaho \tKokko &amp; Puolakanaho \t5:47\n6. \t&quot;The Last One for Life&quot;   \tVetelÃƒÂ¤inen &amp; Puolakanaho \tPuolakanaho &amp; Kokko &amp; Hiltula \t4:59\n7. \t&quot;Sick, Dirty and Mean&quot;   \tAccept \tAccept \t4:16\n8. \t&quot;Blood of Hatred&quot;   \tVetelÃƒÂ¤inen \tKokko &amp; Hiltula \t3:12\n9. \t&quot;Aeon&quot;   \tVetelÃƒÂ¤inen &amp; Puolakanaho \tVetelÃƒÂ¤inen &amp; Hiltula &amp; Puolakanaho &amp; Kokko \t5:45\n\nJapanese bonus tracks:\n\n    &quot;As I Die&quot; (Paradise Lost cover) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:03\n    &quot;The River Flows Frozen&quot; (Acoustic Version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:47\n\nCreditsBand members\n\n    Altti VetelÃƒÂ¤inen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, bass guitar\n    Jarmo Puolakanaho Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Antti Kokko Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar\n    Pasi Hiltula Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n    Petri Sankala Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nGuest appearances\n\n    Juha KylmÃƒÂ¤nen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ clean vocals (on tracks #5, #6 and #11)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f454e01f4b49d34227d75eb3e9794282e675d79f","amp;dn":"Eternal+Tears+Of+Sorrow-A+Virgin+And+A+Whore++mp3+320k++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f454e01f4b49d34227d75eb3e9794282e675d79f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,84,224,31,75,73,211,66,39,215,94,179,233,121,66,130,230,117,215,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
