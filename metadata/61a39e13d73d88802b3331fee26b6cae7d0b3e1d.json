It ran for seven seasons (122 episodes) on NBC from 1993 to 1999, and was succeeded by a TV movie, which also acted as the de-facto series finale. The series was originally based on David Simon\\'s book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Many of the characters and stories used throughout the show were based on events depicted in the book, which was also used for Simon\\'s own series, The Wire on HBO.\n\nHomicide featured an ensemble cast, with starring roles given to Richard Belzer, Daniel Baldwin and Ned Beatty. However, Andre Braugher (as Frank Pembleton) emerged as the series\\' breakout star. The show won Television Critic\\'s Awards for outstanding drama in 1996, 1997, and 1998. It also became the first drama ever to win three Peabody Awards for best drama in 1993, 1995, and 1997.\n\nChris Tergesen became music coordinator during the second season, and more music is featured than in the previous episodes as a result.\n\nA commercial soundtrack CD was never release, but this torrent has surfaced, and I share it with you. In contains several tracks from the soundtrack of the show and some audio clips from episodes.  Homicide Life on the Streets was ground breaking in many areas, story acting and editing.  The inclusion of popular rock music as part of its episodes was another area where the show broke new ground.\n\n\n101 - Homicide-Life on the Street Theme\n\n102 - Seal - Killer\n\n103 - Tori Amos - Crucify\n\n104 - Peter Gabriel - No Self Control\n\n105 - Iguanas - Boom Boom Boom\n\n106 - Faith No More - Evidence\n\n107 - Bo Diddley - You Can\\'t Judge a Book By Its Cover\n\n108 - Dada - Feel Me Don\\'t You\n\n109 - John Hiatt - Blue Telescope\n\n110 - Nina Simone - Sinnerman\n\n111 - Dawn Penn - You Don\\'t Love Me (No No No)\n\n112 - Dire Straits - Your Latest Trick\n\n113 - Buddy Guy with Bonnie Raitt - Feels Like Rain\n\n114 - Heather Nova - Walking Higher\n\n115 - Spinners - Working My Way Back to You\n\n116 - Third Eye Blind - God of Wine\n\n117 - Lisa Germano - The Darkest Night of All\n\n201 - Collective Soul - Bleed\n\n202 - Ani DiFranco - Shameless\n\n203 - Barenaked Ladies - What a Good Boy\n\n204 - Reverend Horton Heat - Your Wildest Dreams\n\n205 - Big Walter Horton - Trouble in Mind\n\n206 - Counting Crows - Raining in Baltimore\n\n207 - Joan Armatrading - Down to Zero\n\n208 - Cowboy Junkies - This Street, That Man, This Life\n\n209 - John Lee Hooker with Van Morrison - I Cover the Waterfront\n\n210 - Tom Waits - Cold Cold Ground\n\n211 - Better Than Ezra - One More Murder\n\n212 - Edwin Hawkins Singers - Im Going Through\n\n213 - Belly - Full Moon, Empty Heart\n\n214 - Drifters - Save the Last Dance for Me\n\n215 - Suzanne Vega - Blood Makes Noise\n\n216 - Soul Coughing - Super Bon Bon\n\n217 - Smashing Pumpkins - Crestfallen\n\n218 - Jimmy Scott - There\\'s No Disappointment in Heaven\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a39e13d73d88802b3331fee26b6cae7d0b3e1d","amp;dn":"Homicide-Life+on+the+Street+-+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a39e13d73d88802b3331fee26b6cae7d0b3e1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,163,158,19,215,61,136,128,43,51,49,254,226,107,108,174,125,11,62,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
