Written by &quot;professors of robotics&quot; such as Gordon McComb and John Iovine, they're great for beginners as well as experienced robot builders.\nAuthoritative, innovative, fun, and always far ahead of anyone else, TAB continues the tradition with Build Your Own Remote-Controlled Robot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30f60eb232a91602250d57fd8a737fa042fe12f6","amp;dn":"Build+A+Remote-Controlled+Robot+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30f60eb232a91602250d57fd8a737fa042fe12f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,246,14,178,50,169,22,2,37,13,87,253,138,115,127,160,66,254,18,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
