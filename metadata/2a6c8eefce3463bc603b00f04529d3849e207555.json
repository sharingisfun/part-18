In Wing Commander you blast your way through the Vega Campaign. You'd better be as good as your reputation because the stakes are too high to play it safe. Just when you think that the action cant get any more intense, or the opposition any stiffer, you'll plunge into Wing Commander II. Disgraced and unjustly court-martialed, you have to prove yourself once again and earn the respect of the Confederation High Command. Of course, there is also the little matter of preventing the destruction of the Terran home-worlds.\n\nFeatures:\n    - The classic of classics, grandfather for a new genre, and an example that was followed by all future space sims\n    - One of the best dynamic soundtracks ever to appear in a video game\n    - The branching storyline shape is based on your successes or failures; you will never have to replay a failed mission\n\n===\n\nIncludes:\n  * manuals\n  * reference cards\n  * ship blueprints\n  * Wing Commander Bible\n\n\nInstall and Play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6c8eefce3463bc603b00f04529d3849e207555","amp;dn":"+Wing+Commander+1%2B2+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6c8eefce3463bc603b00f04529d3849e207555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,108,142,239,206,52,99,188,96,59,0,240,69,41,211,132,158,32,117,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
