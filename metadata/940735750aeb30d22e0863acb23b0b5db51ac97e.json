The group was formed in \n1967 and signed to Decca in England. Their first album was not a success, but \ntheir second, the live Undead (1968) containing &quot;I'm Going Home,&quot; a \nsix-minute blues workout by the fleet-fingered Alvin, hit the charts on both \nsides of the Atlantic. Stonedhenge (1969) hit the U.K. Top Ten in early 1969. \nTen Years After's U.S. breakthrough came as a result of their appearance at \nWoodstock, at which they played a nine-minute version of &quot;I'm Going Home.&quot; \nTheir next album, Ssssh, reached the U.S. Top 20, and Cricklewood Green, \ncontaining the hit single &quot;Love Like a Man,&quot; reached number four. Watt \ncompleted the group's Decca contract, after which they signed with Columbia \nand moved in a more mainstream pop direction, typified by the gold-selling \n1971 album A Space in Time and its Top 40 single &quot;I'd Love to Change the \nWorld.&quot; Subsequent efforts in that direction were less successful, however, \nand Ten Years After split up after the release of Positive Vibrations in 1974. \nThey reunited in 1988 for concerts in Europe and recorded their first new \nalbum in 15 years, About Time, in 1989 before disbanding once again. In \n2001, Ric Lee was preparing the back catalog for re-release when he \ndiscovered the Live at the Fillmore East 1970 tapes. He approached Alvin \nabout getting back together to promote the lost album, but Alvin Lee \ndeclined. The rest of the band was up for it, though, and together with \nguitarist Joe Gooch, Ten Years After started touring again. In addition to \ntouring the world, this new incarnation recorded its first new material in about \na decade and a half and released Now in 2004 and added the live double CD \nset Roadworks in 2005. Alvin Lee died on March 6, 2013 at the age of 68 due \nto complications from a routine surgery. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940735750aeb30d22e0863acb23b0b5db51ac97e","amp;dn":"Ten+Years+After+-+Gold+Collection+%281998%29+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940735750aeb30d22e0863acb23b0b5db51ac97e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,7,53,117,10,235,48,210,46,8,99,172,178,59,11,93,181,26,201,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
