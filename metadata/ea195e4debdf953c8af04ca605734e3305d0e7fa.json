First and foremost is &quot;Hold On,&quot; a cool, shuffling, timeless hip-hop R&amp;B track which peaked at number two on the pop charts and showcased the girls' effortless harmonies. &quot;Lies,&quot; which alternated lead vocalists (and featured a rap courtesy of Debbie T.), managed to crack the Top 40 while proving that all members of the quartet were equally adept at handling lead vocals. \nThe biting &quot;You Don't Have to Worry&quot; and the sensual &quot;Don't Go&quot; both scored high on the R&amp;B charts without becoming pop hits. Other highlights include the funky new jill swing track &quot;Strange&quot; and their one-minute version of &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; (which should have been a full-length recording). \nThere are a couple of duds, including &quot;Part of Me,&quot; &quot;Just Can't Stay Away,&quot; and the CD bonus track, &quot;Waitin' on You,&quot; but overall this album is a winner, and was just a preview of the massive success they would achieve with 1992's Funky Divas.
