Not only did Monk help invent the music we now call be-bop, but he also introduced jazz music to the avant-garde, setting the table for a tradition unmatched in American music. Monk's legacy is unquestioned and his melodies echo through almost every genre of music to this day. Yet one thing Thelonious never got enough credit for was his piano playing. Monk developed a halting, stop-start style as unique and singular as his compositions. While melodies seemed to drop from Monk's fingers, he also spiced his tunes with left-field plinks and plunks, blistering right-handed runs and thunderous left handed slams. \nOn Monk Alone: The Complete Solo Studio Recordings of Thelonious Monk 1962-1968, , the genius of Monk is plainly evident. Monk can ache with what he called &quot;ugly beauty&quot; while also adding his own inventions to standards. The highlight of this collection are 14 previously unreleased tracks, including alternate takes of Monk masterpieces like &quot;Ruby, My Dear,&quot; &quot;Introspection,&quot; and &quot;Ask Me Now \n\nTracklist, \nDisc One:\n01.
