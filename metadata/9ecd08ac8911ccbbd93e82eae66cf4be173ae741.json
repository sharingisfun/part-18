They ultimately defeated him and hunted down his descendants, as they are the only ones able to wield the blade.\n\nIts members are drawn both from the Shi'ar and other alien races governed by the Shi'ar. The majority of the Imperial Guard's members are known as Borderers. They assist the governors of conquered planets in enforcing the Shi'ar imperial law.\n\nThe Imperial Guardsmen however belong to the elite corps that protects the ruler of the empire, known as the Majestor or Majestrix, and executes his or her orders. The praetor (leader) of this elite corps is Gladiator, the most powerful member of the entire Imperial Guard.\n\nThe duty of the Imperial Guard is to serve the monarch of the Shi'ar, no matter who it may be. The Guardsmen once aided the mad emperor D'Ken against his rebellious sister Lilandra, but when Lilandra succeeded D'Ken as ruler, the Guard switched their loyalty to her.\n\nThe Imperial Guard was created by Chris Claremont, Dave Cockrum and Dan Green in 1977 and first appeared in X-Men # 107. Many of the characters that make up the Imperial Guard are in fact loosely based on many of the characters that make up DC Comics Legion of Superheroes. Scintilla for example bearing resemblance to Shrinking Violet, Hobgoblin based on Chameleon Boy, Fang based on Timber Wolf, and Astra based on Phantom Girl, among many other parallels.\n\nThanks goes to Meganubis and Mediozo for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ecd08ac8911ccbbd93e82eae66cf4be173ae741","amp;dn":"Imperial+Guard+1-3+%281997%29+%28Complete%29+%28Megiozo-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ecd08ac8911ccbbd93e82eae66cf4be173ae741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,205,8,172,137,17,204,187,217,62,130,234,230,108,244,190,23,58,231,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
