cover to cover\nc2cO - Official Marvel scan\nremix - a full version of the comic sourced from reprints\n24pgs - not a c2c,usually just the cover and story pages\nfc only - front cover only where the comic is missing\n\nAbout the Complete Marvel Chronology\n\nThe Complete Marvel Chronology (CMC) is version 2.0 of the Marvel Chronology (MC).\n\nThe MC was created by cyager69, aka Chuck, who uploaded Marvel comics beginning with Fantastic Four 001 (Nov 61) through to the issues published in Jun 1997.\n\nWhen Chuck was unable to continue the uploads I took over the MC and uploaded the remainder of the issues through to December 2008. Additional uploads added various titles not cover-dated with a specific month (the 'Decades' uploads) and seven Fill packs added new scans for issues missing when the original uploads were done for the 70's through to the 90's.\n\nWith none of Chuck's original uploads online, the decision was to either upload the original version of 1961-1996 or go with a brand new, full version incorporating the missing genres, such as romance, western and humour, and including the imprints which Chuck intended to upload following the completion of the MC.\n\nThe CMC will cover Marvel's entire seventy year history. 1939-2006 and 2009-2012 (apart from 201200) are now complete, during 2013 the gap of 2007-2008 will be added as will the 2013 uploads, along with 201200\n\nNews and Notes\n\nThe CMC is back! Following the temporary demise of h33t all went quiet on the torrent front but starting now you can look forward to seeing all the Marvel uploads return to both Kickass and h33t.\n\nToday sees the upload of 201301 and 201302, next up will be 201303 in a week or so.\n\nAlso look out for ZincÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upload of the Complete Marvel Chronology, who uploaded 1939-1969 when h33t was offline.\n\nFor details of future uploads keep track of all the news at\n\nPete\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nBooks used as research material in completing the CMC include -\n\nMarvel Chronicle - Tom DeFalco\nMarvel Vault - Roy Thomas and Pete Sanderson\nTales of the Implosion - Tom Lammers\nStandard Catalogue of Comics 5th Edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b568c3413b08967969dfe2bf34ba355dedcbcff8","amp;dn":"+%2B1+++0+++report+fake+Complete+Marvel+Chronology+2013+01+%5BPeteTh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b568c3413b08967969dfe2bf34ba355dedcbcff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,104,195,65,59,8,150,121,105,223,226,191,52,186,53,93,237,203,207,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
