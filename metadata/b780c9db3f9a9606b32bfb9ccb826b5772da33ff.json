It contains twenty chapters covering several interesting research topics written by researchers and experts in the field of earthquake engineering. The book covers seismic-resistance\n\ndesign of masonry and reinforced concrete structures to be constructed as well as safety assessment, strengthening and rehabilitation of existing structures against earthquake loads. It also includes three chapters on electromagnetic sensing techniques for health assessment of structure, post earthquake assessment of steel buildings in fire environment and response of underground pipes to blast loads. The book provides the state-of-the-art on recent progress in earthquake-resistant structures. It should be useful to graduate students, researchers and practicing structural engineers.\n\n\nEnjoy And Seed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b780c9db3f9a9606b32bfb9ccb826b5772da33ff","amp;dn":"EarthQuake+Resistant+Structures-2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b780c9db3f9a9606b32bfb9ccb826b5772da33ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,128,201,219,63,154,150,6,179,43,251,156,203,130,107,87,114,218,51,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
