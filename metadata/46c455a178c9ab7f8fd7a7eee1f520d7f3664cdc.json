Join the unlikely  duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventures as they leave their mark on monumental events and keep history from becomingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ well history...\n\nI have all 91 Episodes which were all a part of the Rocky and Bullwinkle show which ran for 5 years (form 1959 to 1964).  I am posting 5 torrents - one for each year.\n\nPlease note:  Since Peabody and his boy Sherman were incorporated in the RB show, I have cut out just their segments - each program runs for about 5 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46c455a178c9ab7f8fd7a7eee1f520d7f3664cdc","amp;dn":"Mr.+Peabody+and+Sherman+-+Season+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46c455a178c9ab7f8fd7a7eee1f520d7f3664cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,196,85,161,120,201,171,127,143,215,167,238,225,245,32,215,243,102,76,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
