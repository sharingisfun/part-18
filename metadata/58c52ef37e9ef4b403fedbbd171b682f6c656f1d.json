Here&amp;#039;s a few different ways to look at it:\n\nFor those that haven&amp;#039;t seen the film, this director&amp;#039;s edition is undoubtedly the way to go. It&amp;#039;s a fuller, richer, and more epic narrative packed solid with everything you&amp;#039;d be prepared to see from an action / adventure rendition of Troy&amp;#039;s tale. Those that liked the original enough to own the flick or who saw it and didn&amp;#039;t enjoy it, this cut is undoubtedly worth a look. You&amp;#039;re working with a fantastic video and audio presentation, as well as the lion&amp;#039;s share of extras from the original disc (The Gallery of the Gods portion doesn&amp;#039;t seem to be on this new set). And, for those collectors who are looking into the HD-DVD or Blu-Ray version in comparison to the Ultimate Edition with all the beautiful supplements, you won&amp;#039;t be terribly disappointed with the aesthetic presentation of the film itself - though a slight boost in sharpness in video and, especially, in audio might be worth your consideration.\n\nNo matter which edition you pick up, whether it&amp;#039;s the Ultimate Edition, high-definition, or the beautifully cost efficient standard edition, Troy: The Director&amp;#039;s Cut is a worthy, beautifully reengineered epic that&amp;#039;s worth your time. Highly Recommended.\n\nWith &quot;30 Minutes of Never Before Seen Footage&quot;, Troy is longer, bloodier, and much more sprawling in scope. More importantly, it recovers the stolen spirit lost in the theatrical cut. In short, Troy: The Director&amp;#039;s Cut, though still not the perfect marriage between Homer and the cinema screen, stands strong as a more enthralling and sweeping epic that easily trumps its predecessor.\n\n\nEnglish Subs http://subs.sab.bz/index.php?act=download&amp;attach_id=8031\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nFRAGMENT\n?
