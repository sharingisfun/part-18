After a nearly three year hiatus, John Frusciante returns with PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone, a full length album that marks the former RHCP guitarists foray into the world of electronic music. Produced, engineered and performed by Frusciante himself, PBX blends Frusciante's well known songwriting prowess with his newfound love for electronic music.\n\n\n The ever-winding path of John Frusciante's solo career is a confusing one to say the least. Light years away from his contributions to the Red Hot Chili Peppers as a guitar slinger from the school of Hendrix, Frusciante's solo albums have been visceral, howling affairs dealing with raw nerves and dark places in the human spirit. Now with both PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone and the Letur-Lefr EP that came just before it, his music becomes an unfiltered mesh of every conceivable style, sometimes to the point of incoherence. Recorded throughout 2011, the album was the result of Frusciante's dream to create electronic music, but seems like more of a synthesis of a multitude of different directions, sometimes branching out in all of these directions at once. &quot;Ratiug&quot; is one of the tracks more easily recognizable as a traditional rock song, but it's still a dizzying mixed bag. Moody alt-rock chord progressions and multi-tracked vocals float over collage-style drumbeats. A sample of the snare hit introduction from Joy Division's &quot;Disorder&quot; is easily picked out, but less familiar sampled drum breaks make way for lazy horn sections and eventually a freestyle routine by MC Kinetic 9 rounds out the confusing song over a bed of synth strings. This kind of experimentation runs wild throughout the album, with every song a collision of rudimentary electronics, gritty drum'n'bass rhythm tracks, and even a little dubstep wobble thrown in for good measure before quickly jumping ship to the next sound. &quot;Sam&quot; begins with a nauseating duo of rhythmless live drums and stuttering vocal samples, breaking into a burst of distorted jungle rhythms thick with metal guitars, melding Atari Teenage Riot with Negativland with Soundgarden. A song like &quot;Mistakes&quot; moves so frantically from out-of-the-box keyboard sounds and by-the-book electro sounds to a mishmash of rock guitar and prog histrionics it threatens to come off as parody. The thing is, there's no doubt that Frusciante is sincere in his expression with this incredibly warped music. There's no easy explanation for these sounds, no context for a lot of the choices he makes with the rapid-fire style changes and jarring production choices that come one after another after another on almost every song here. Instead of sounding indulgent, or even busy, the field of sound Frusciante creates sounds strangely uniform in its complete insanity. Much like the schizophrenic landscape of a record like Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, PBX FIZ creates a language of its own out of the chaos, and by the end, we have a few hints at what kind of deeper message lies beneath the confusion. Frusciante's specific breed of acid house-inspired electro dabbling with roots in alternative radio rock circa 1995 is going to prove too challenging for most listeners, and even fans of his strange language might have a hard time peeling back the layers.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Intro / Sabam\n 02 - Hear Say\n 03 - Bike\n 04 - Ratiug\n 05 - Guitar\n 06 - Mistakes\n 07 - Uprane\n 08 - Sam\n 09 - Sum\n\n It was purchased as Official Digital Download 32bit/96kHz and downsampled to 24bit for FLAC compatiblity.\n\n\n\nJohn Frusciante - Outsides (EP 2013)\n FLAC (tracks) 24 bit/96 kHz | Time - 36:59 minutes | 434 MB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: WEB | Front cover\n\n 2013 EP by former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante. Outsides consists of a 10 minute guitar solo and 2 abstract 'out' pieces of music. This 10 minute song gives new life to the long ago popularly discarded form of the extended Rock guitar solo, and is also Progressive Synthpop just the same.\n\n\n Anyone following the warped path of John Frusciante's solo music can tell you that all bets are off when trying to determine its motivations, process, or intent. Since the mid-'90s, the recordings Frusciante made while moonlighting from his main gig as guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers have always been obtuse, confusing affairs, ranging from early dazed singer/songwriter outsider sounds to a series of EPs and mini-albums in the early 2010s that incorporated twisted electronic elements into their sliced-and-diced take on pop tracks. Outsides, yet another EP in line with its predecessors, takes another odd turn, offering just three almost completely instrumental tracks, each harder to pin down than the last. Acting almost more like a &quot;maxi-single,&quot; the EP centers around opening track &quot;Same,&quot; a ten-minute guitar solo with live drums and pads of various synths backing up the meandering exploration through various changes in key and effects processing. This is a little too scattered and the backing instrumentation a bit too jarring to hit the heights of something like Funkadelic's similarly epic &quot;Maggot Brain,&quot; but through Frusciante's weird lens, it comes close. The remaining tracks, while shorter, veer into much stranger waters. &quot;Breathiac&quot; takes on an almost musique concrÃƒÂ¨te feel, meshing cinematic strings, dubby vocal samples, and malfunctioning drum machine sounds into an extremely fragmented collage. The experiments with both tape and arrangements for woodwinds give way to a gurgling acid house bassline as the song wraps up, effectively imagining a collaboration between Aphex Twin and Stockhausen. The final track, &quot;Shelf,&quot; is much the same, with more moments of rhythmic cohesion and an icy synth melody that recalls the earliest Squarepusher albums. Outsides is yet another strange installment in Frusciante's unabashedly weird and sometimes uncomfortably naked evolution as a solo artist. His dabbling with electronic music makes as little sense as any of his other abstract styles, but there's something undeniable about it in its honesty and raw presentation. Again Frusciante succeeds in making music caught between extremely deliberate tendencies and total randomness.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Same\n 02 - Breathiac\n 03 - Shelf\n 04 - Sol\n\nIt was purchased as Official Digital Download 32bit/96kHz and downsampled to 24bit for FLAC compatiblity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7680564c1a1806b465254a336602a5a172877a54","amp;dn":"John+Frusciante+-2+albums%28Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers%29%5B24-96%5D+Official","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7680564c1a1806b465254a336602a5a172877a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,128,86,76,26,24,6,180,101,37,74,51,102,2,165,161,114,135,122,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
