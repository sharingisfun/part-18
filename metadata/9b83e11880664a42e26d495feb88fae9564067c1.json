These artists were Barry Windsor-Smith, Jeff Jones, Michael William Kaluta, and Bernie Wrightson - known colloquially as the &quot;Fab Four&quot;.\n\nThe studio space was a converted machine shop with high ceilings.\n\nIndustry journalist Tom Spurgeon commented on the broader significance and influence of The Studio in his 2011 obituary of Jones at The Comics Reporter:\nThe legacy of that much talent doing what was collectively very good work at a point of almost monolithic and degrading corporate influence over the kind of art they wanted to do has provided The Studio with a legacy that can be embraced even by those that didn't particularly care for the artists' output. The idea of a dedicated workplace that would allow for coercive influence one artist to another has been carried over into very nearly every cartoonists' collective space initiative since.\n\nBy 1979, the &quot;Fab Four&quot; had produced enough material to issue an art book under the name The Studio, which was published by Dragon's Dream. That same year the members of The Studio moved on to independent projects and work spaces.\n\nThe Studio &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7575064/The_Studio_-_Michael_Kaluta__Barry_Windsor-Smith__amp__more__&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7575064/The_Studio_-_Michael_Kaluta__Barry_Windsor-Smith__amp__more__&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRavens &amp; Rainbows (wish IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been more aware I was titling this torrent Jeffrey Jones instead of Jeff) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7690816/Jeffrey_Jones_-_Ravens__amp__Rainbows_(Expanded_-_Restored)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7690816/Jeffrey_Jones_-_Ravens__amp__Rainbows_(Expanded_-_Restored)&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b83e11880664a42e26d495feb88fae9564067c1","amp;dn":"Jeff+Jones+-+Spasm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b83e11880664a42e26d495feb88fae9564067c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,131,225,24,128,102,74,66,226,109,73,95,235,136,250,233,86,64,103,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
