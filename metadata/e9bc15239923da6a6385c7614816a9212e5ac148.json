With bassist Wilbur Ware and drummer Philly Joe Jones, Drew interprets eight Rodgers and Hart tunes, five written for the play Pal Joey and three of their earlier hits that were included in the film version. \n\nDrew contributes swing and subtle bop-based improvising to these superior melodies (which are highlighted by &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,&quot; &quot;I Could Write a Book,&quot; and &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot;), and the results are quite memorable.\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
