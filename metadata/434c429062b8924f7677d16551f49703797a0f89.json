He played with all the greats, from Bessie Smith and Duke Ellington to Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis. \n\nOn the positive side: \nOver an hour of varied material from the 40's thru the 60's.  Highlights includes: another rendition of the famed &quot;Body and Soul&quot; solo, a gorgeious duet (duel?) with Ben Webster, an awesome unaccompanied solo &quot;Picasso&quot;, a heart-rending &quot;Night and Day&quot;, and a total of 62 minutes of the mother of all (tenor) sax players.  There is some great piano work from Hank Jones, Tommy Flannagan and Oscar Peterson.  \n\nOn the negative side: \nThere seems to be no rhyme or reason to the order of the tracks.  There is a jarring inconsistency in sound quality; to be expected on older vs newer tracks, but there seems to be some big differences in sound on cuts from the same date! And can't we use digital remastering to reduce or eliminate the jarring applause on the live tracks? Contrast this with the Decca &quot;Coleman Hawkins in the 50's&quot;, which mixes arguably weaker commercial, bop, and swing jazz in a sequence that plays well and with a consistency of sound quality that makes for a better listening experience when playing the CD straight through.  ~ Johnny Hodges\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 34 - Coleman Hawkins Tracks:\n01  Body And Soul 3:24 \n02  The Big Head 3:20 \n03  Time On My Hands 2:28 \n04  Rifftide (aka ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDisorder At The Border&quot;) 4:24 \n05  Bean And The Boys 7:02 \n06  Cocktails For Two 2:39 \n07  Hanid 4:50 \n08  Just One Of Those Things 4:29 \n09  I Only Have Eyes For You 3:09 \n10  Hallelujah 3:58 \n11  Night And Day 3:18 \n12  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“S Wonderful 2:56 \n13  Ill Wind (YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re BlowinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Me No Good) 5:33 \n14  The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise 3:47 \n15  I Wished On The Moon 3:37 \n16  Picasso 3:14 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:434c429062b8924f7677d16551f49703797a0f89","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+34+-+Coleman+Hawkins+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160-32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"434c429062b8924f7677d16551f49703797a0f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,76,66,144,98,184,146,79,118,119,209,101,81,244,151,3,121,122,15,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
