As you pass your mouse cursor over a section of the viewing area, \nthe display is magnified making it instantly more readable and accessible.\nIn addition, you can apply a variety of visual effects and enhancements to that \ndisplay.\n\n\n\nWhat can &quot;Magnifying Glass Pro&quot; do for you?\n\n- Aid with compromised vision.\n- Lessen eyestrain for those with normal vision.\n- Enhance onscreen and projected detail.\n- Allow modification of the magnified area in real time (e.g., invert or rotate \n  the image, change the contrast).\n- Take advantage of multi-monitor systems. For example, one monitor (or TV screen)\n  could be dedicated to a full-screen Glass -- a magnified, easy-to-view display of \n  the image on the primary working display.\n- Provide you with more control over your business presentations.\n\n\n\nUnique Features\n\nMagnifying Glass Pro differs from similar utilities with the inclusion of a unique \nset of features, including: \n\n- Modification of an onscreen image in real time (e.g., adjust contrast, add \n  special effects, smoothing, and so on). \n- Adjust the screen position of the magnifying Glass (e.g., a fixed position, \n  under the cursor, angular, and so on). \n- Save multiple set of viewing preferences as individual Profiles, then switch \n  between those Profiles instantly (e.g., you can have one Profile for viewing \n  text and another for working with graphic images). \n- Show/hide the Magnifying Glass simply by shaking the mouse cursor from side to \n  side. This is much easier than using the keyboard shortcut when your hand is \n  already on the mouse. \n- Command Mode, which enables you to quickly change/apply Magnifying Glass options \n  (e.g., Glass size and position, transparency, contrast, effects, and so on). \n- The Auto-switcher, which enables you to associate individual applications, \n  windows, and screen elements with specific user-defined Profiles (group of Glass \n  settings). As the &quot;target&quot; changes (e.g., you switch applications) the Auto-\n  switcher applies the appropriate Glass settings automatically, based on the \n  defined Profile association, with no interruption to your productivity. \n -No restrictions on how you can use Magnifying Glass Pro. You control the size \n  and position of the Glass -- it can occupy the entire screen, or a smaller, \n  user-defined area. It can even extend beyond the edges of your screen to move \n  to a second monitor. You can quickly and easily apply a myriad of effects to \n  enhance your viewing experience and solve the sophisticated needs of any text- \n  or graphics-based project. \n\n\n\nLanguages: English, Russian, German, Dutch, Portugues, French, Spanish.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n- Windows 9x /ME, Windows NT / 2000 / XP, Windows Vista\n- Preferred CPU frequency is 500 MHz and more.\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.workerscollection.com/wcollect/english/html/mg_pro.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.workerscollection.com/wcollect/english/html/mg_pro.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- Avira AntiVir Premium \n3- avast! Pro Antivirus\n4- Kaspersky Antivirus \n\nAlso scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected \nby other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at April 05, 2010 - 22.45 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85af360f3ece8906b09fc99e7ff5013f5aba91b","amp;dn":"Magnifying+Glass+Pro+v1.8+%28Multilanguage%29+%2B+Key+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85af360f3ece8906b09fc99e7ff5013f5aba91b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,90,243,96,243,236,232,144,107,9,252,153,231,255,80,19,245,171,169,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
