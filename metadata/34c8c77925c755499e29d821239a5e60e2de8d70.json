We All Know That You Can Do It 7&quot; Bicycle Records release isn't included.  I plan to make a separate torrent for that release.\n\nThis torrent contains:\n[1997] Big City (EP)\n[1997] Broken Star\n[2000] Broken Van\n+ &quot;Fuck the Church&quot; from Drive-Thru Records' &quot;Where's the Beef?&quot; compilation\n\n\nThis torrent contains 3 of the many CDs I ripped for posterity a while back.\nI went through many phases when it came to rip/encode/split methods.\n\n[1997] Broken Star\nThis one was made before I documented the split.\nI used CUETools to verify each file and generate an AccurateRip/CTDB log. This log as well as the original EAC log is included.\n\n[1997] Big City (EP) &amp; [2000] Broken Van\nThe original morituri logs are included.\n\nWhat is morituri?\n&quot;morituri is a CD ripper aiming for accuracy over speed. Its features are modeled to compare with Exact Audio Copy on Windows.&quot; - https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri\n\nWhy use morituri over the de facto EAC?\nI'm a long-time Linux user.  Tired of running EAC in Wine and all the tweaking required to do so.\n\nI'm new to this.  Please comment and tell me if I'm doing anything right or wrong.
