The monarchy is one of longest surviving institutions -- as well as one of its most tumultuous and revered. In this masterful book, David Starkey looks at the monarchy as a whole, charting its history from Roman times, to the Wars of the Roses, the chaos of the Civil War, the fall of Charles I and Cromwell's emergence as Lord Protector -- all the way up until the Victorian era when monarchs came face-to-face with modernity. \n\nThis brilliant collection of biographies of kings and queens provides an in-depth examination of what the monarchy has meant, what it means now and what it will continue to mean. Bringing to life a cast of colourful characters, Starkey's trademark energy and authority make him the perfect guide on this epic, accessible and compelling journey, as he offers us a vivid portrait of culture, politics and nationhood through an institution that has defined the realm for nearly two thousand years.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20fdb29cbfc4f29cb4c7714137753325575bb2b9","amp;dn":"Crown+and+Country+-+David+Starkey+%28Unabridged+-+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20fdb29cbfc4f29cb4c7714137753325575bb2b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,253,178,156,191,196,242,156,180,199,113,65,55,117,51,37,87,91,178,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
