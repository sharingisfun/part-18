Indeed, the Hawaiian surfing champion turned alternative pop-folk star really hasn't changed things one iota for his sophomore release. Fans of Brushfire Fairytales should be delighted with the results. The groove is a mellow one--most of the 16 tracks here are semi-acoustic--and that easy-going spirit filters into Johnson's lyrical philosophies. &quot;What will be will be / And so it goes&quot; he sings on &quot;Times Like These,&quot; the opening track. Thankfully, Johnson is never too mellow, and there's a &quot;Don't worry, be happy&quot; vibe to most of his music. &quot;The Horizon Has Been Defeated&quot; even has a pseudo-reggae feel to it. Although classified as an alternative musician, the singer-songwriter's compositions owe much to past hits. &quot;Traffic in the Sky&quot; is reminiscent of Jim Croce's &quot;Operator&quot; and Looking Glass's one-hit-wonder, &quot;Brandy.&quot; On the splendid &quot;Taylor,&quot; Johnson sounds an awful lot like Donovan. And &quot;By The Way&quot; recalls the Lovin' Spoonful. -- Bill Holdship \n\nTracklisting:\n\n1 Times Like These (2:21) \n2 The Horizon Has Been Defeated (2:33) \n3 Traffic In The Sky (2:50) \n4 Taylor (3:59) \n5 Gone (2:10) \n6 Cupid (1:05) \n7 Wasting Time (3:50) \n8 Holes To Heaven (2:54) \n9 Dreams Be Dreams (2:12) \n10 Tomorrow Morning (2:50) \n11 Fall Line (1:35) \n12 Cookie Jar (2:56) \n13 Rodeo Clowns (2:38) \n14 Cocoon (4:10) \n15 Mediocre Bad Guys (2:59) \n16 Symbol In My Driveway (2:53) \n\nEnjoy and Seed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:229e2f1c37f3da15806650ce38e86daf8feef907","amp;dn":"Jack+Johnson+On+%26+On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"229e2f1c37f3da15806650ce38e86daf8feef907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,158,47,28,55,243,218,21,128,102,80,206,56,232,109,175,143,238,249,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
