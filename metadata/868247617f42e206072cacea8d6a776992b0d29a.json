However, I can't seem to get this version to update. Otherwise it works perfectly if your moto is supported.  \n\nIf you have an older version, say 3.xx for my older V551, please post the link here.  The contact/address book function won't allow me to save or change the contacts which sucks. BTW 3.11's got no valid seeders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:868247617f42e206072cacea8d6a776992b0d29a","amp;dn":"Motorola+Phone+Tools+5.0.5.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"868247617f42e206072cacea8d6a776992b0d29a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,130,71,97,127,66,226,6,7,44,172,234,141,106,119,105,146,176,210,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
