Alan Moore either wrote a poem or a movie script and then someone else turned them into comics. \n\nTitles include Alan Moore's Fashion Beasts, Alan Moore's Hypothetical Lizard, Alan Moore's The Courtyard, Alan Moore's Another Suburban Romance, Alan Moore's Light Of Thy Countenance, Alan Moore's Magic Words, Alan Moore's Old Gansters Never Die\n\nPlease enjoy. Please please please donate to this Kickstarter\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b266c32f293840eaacdad8ea7e1672815b4a647","amp;dn":"Alan+Moore+Collection+VI-+Made+For+Moore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b266c32f293840eaacdad8ea7e1672815b4a647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,38,108,50,242,147,132,14,170,205,173,142,167,225,103,40,21,180,166,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
