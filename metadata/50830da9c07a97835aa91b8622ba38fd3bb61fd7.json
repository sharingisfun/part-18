Situated in the hills above Innsbruck, the Castle of Ambras is one of the most important sights of the city. Its cultural and historical importance is closely connected with Archduke Ferdinand II and was a residence of his from 1563 to 1595.\n\nIn the lower part of the castle there are two rooms containing arms and armor, on the first floor a valuable art collection and in the upper part of the castle, the bathroom of Ferdinand's wife Philippine Welser. The Spanish hall between the lower and upper part of the castles is a notable example of German Renaissance architecture and is adorned with frescoes on the walls.\n\nToday, collections at Ambras Castle are administered by the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50830da9c07a97835aa91b8622ba38fd3bb61fd7","amp;dn":"Portraits+Collection+of+Ambras+Castle+in+Innsbruck+%28Art+painting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50830da9c07a97835aa91b8622ba38fd3bb61fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,131,13,169,192,122,151,131,90,169,27,134,34,186,56,253,59,182,31,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
