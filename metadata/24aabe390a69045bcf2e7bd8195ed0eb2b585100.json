Their sound has been described as hard rock, heavy metal and Southern metal.\n\nThe band is best known for its song &quot;The Lumberjack&quot;, which features a chainsaw solo by lead singer Jesse James Dupree. On the recording, Dupree alternately revs the chainsaw's engine or uses the chain brake to slow the engine down to change the pitch. He also performs this stunt live and the number typically climaxes with Dupree slicing up a wooden stool onstage, smashing it, and throwing the sliced pieces out to the crowd. He once had been asked, &quot;How the hell can you play a chainsaw?&quot;, to which he responded, &quot;How the hell can you not play a chainsaw?&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nJackyl is the 1992 debut album by the band of the same name.\n\nThe clean version omitted &quot;She Loves My Cock.&quot; Likewise, on the cover art of edited versions, the &quot;Parental Advisory&quot; logo in the background is altered to say &quot;Meaty bones beware of Jackyl.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24aabe390a69045bcf2e7bd8195ed0eb2b585100","amp;dn":"Jackyl+-+Jackyl+%5B1992%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24aabe390a69045bcf2e7bd8195ed0eb2b585100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,170,190,57,10,105,4,91,207,46,123,216,25,94,208,235,43,88,81,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
