He also refrains from any virtuoso performances, delivering very little of his usual flashy fretwork. While this might disappoint some, the simplified approach magnifies his improvements as a songwriter. &quot;Birth of the True&quot; opens the album with an effective stab at melodic pop/rock, while &quot;Great Big Sea&quot; is a fun tribute to Chuck Berry complete with rolling drums, lyrical double entendres, and his signature stuttered guitar chords. The melancholy &quot;May You Never&quot; is an optimistic slice of acoustic blues that is given a country tinge by a lovely, understated slide guitar solo. &quot;Singing in the Dark&quot; counters its funky acoustic guitar riff with a stark tale of heartbreak, while &quot;She Loves Me (When I Try)&quot; is a lovelorn ballad that comes closest to his mellow early work. At just under 40 minutes, Nectar is a concise effort that emphasizes Williams' growth as a songwriter, filtering his many influences into a delightful folk-pop effort that de-emphasizes his technical prowess and continues his streak of winning albums. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/10/24/brooks-williams/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11be530af93d2b71073d1f1d8cfc6853a43213ed","amp;dn":"Brooks+Williams...Nectar%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11be530af93d2b71073d1f1d8cfc6853a43213ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,190,83,10,249,61,43,113,7,61,31,29,140,252,104,83,164,50,19,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
