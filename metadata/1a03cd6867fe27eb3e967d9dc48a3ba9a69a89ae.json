On the back of this, The Very Best Of Andy Williams collects a massive 50 tracks on two CDs, providing a definitive overview of the lounge icon's career. Of course, &quot;Music To Watch Girls By&quot; is here--it could hardly claim to be the definitive &quot;Best Of&quot; collection without the song that relaunched his career at the end of the Twentieth Century. Where this collection really succeeds, however, is through its inclusion of the songs he helped to turn into standards: &quot;Moon River&quot;, &quot;Spooky&quot;, &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You&quot;, &quot;Up, Up And Away&quot; and the jaunty &quot;The House Of Bamboo&quot;. The Very Best Of Andy Williams is good, clean, wholesome fun, saved from the abject depths of irony by the singer's obvious sincerity. -- Amazon.co.uk Review By Michael Carter.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Music To Watch Girls By\n[02] The House Of Bamboo\n[03] Spooky\n[04] Happy Heart\n[05] Up, Up And Away\n[06] Born Free\n[07] The Impossible Dream\n[08] A Time For Us\n[09] Almost There\n[10] Call Me Irresponsible\n[11] I'm All Smiles\n[12] Can't Get Used To Losing You\n[13] It's So Easy\n[14] Can't Help Falling In Love\n[15] MacArthur Park\n[16] Home Lovin' Man\n[17] Where Do I Begin\n[18] Whistling Away The Dark\n[19] Love Theme From The Godfather\n[20] Getting Over You\n[21] The Other Side Of Me\n[22] You Lay So Easy On My Mind\n[23] Abraham, Martin And John\n[24] Amazing Grace\n[25] Solitaire\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:16m:25s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Moon River\n[02] Can't Take My Eyes Off You\n[03] On The Street Where You Live\n[04] Embraceable You\n[05] Canadian Sunset\n[06] Dreamsville\n[07] The Shadow Of Your Smile\n[08] In The Arms Of Love\n[09] Under Paris Skies\n[10] April In Paris\n[11] Charade\n[12] Days Of Wine And Roses\n[13] The Hawaiian Wedding Song\n[14] Unchained Melody\n[15] Danny Boy\n[16] The Village Of St.Bernadette\n[17] Stranger On The Shore\n[18] Do You Mind\n[19] (In The Summertime) You Don't Want My Love\n[20] A Fool Never Learns\n[21] I Like Your Kind Of Love\n[22] Butterfly\n[23] Lonely Street\n[24] September Song\n[25] May Each Day\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:11m:10s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 02h:27m:35s\nTotal File Size....................... 351mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
