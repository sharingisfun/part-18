Unfortunately, Zevon's follow-up, 2002's My Ride's Here, for the most part recalls second-tier Zevon albums like Mr. Bad Example or Mutineer; the jokes tend to be a bit obvious, the more introspective moments don't connect the way one might hope; and the music often lacks the physical or emotional strength to bring these songs across. (It doesn't help that Zevon sounds a bit bored or distracted on much of this set.) My Ride's Here also finds Zevon collaborating with a number of writers from outside the world of music (not the first time he's done this; novelist Tom McGuane co-wrote &quot;The Overdraft&quot; on Envoy), but the results are not especially encouraging. Novelist Carl Hiaasen co-wrote &quot;Basket Case,&quot; an ode to an insane girlfriend that's one of the least effective tunes on the album, and while gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson struggles to make &quot;You're a Whole Different Person When You're Scared&quot; sound ominous, the results fall flat. Sportswriter Mitch Albom, of all people, turns in the best collaboration on the album; if there isn't much depth or subtlety to &quot;Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song),&quot; at least the jokes are funny and the narrative holds together (and that's David Letterman providing the voice of the obnoxious fan). The sardonic &quot;Genius&quot; and &quot;Sacrificial Lambs,&quot; and the title cut -- a meditation on mortality that would have fit in on Life'll Kill Ya -- are strong enough to remind listeners of just how talented Zevon still is, but for the most part My Ride's Here is a misfire from an artist capable of much better work.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca2e27e2a02cae12098fa184b4acc207be291ecb","amp;dn":"Warren+Zevon+-+My+Ride%27s+Here+%5B2001%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca2e27e2a02cae12098fa184b4acc207be291ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,46,39,226,160,44,174,18,9,143,161,132,180,172,194,7,190,41,30,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
