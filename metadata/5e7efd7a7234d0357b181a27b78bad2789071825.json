It also offers plenty of opportunities for a veteran mercenary \ncommander... Such as yourself.\n\nMechCommander 2 is a game of real-time tactical mech combat, and a \nsequel to the original MechCommander. Take on missions from your \nemployer(s).\n\nOnce you have selected a mission, you need to outfit your mechs. You \ncan purchase new mechs if you have enough C-Bills, but most of your \nacquisition will come from salvage of downed mechs. You can then refit \nthe mechs by changing its loadout to customize for the pilot.\n\nAfter you have chosen your mechs and properly outfitted them, it's time \nto assign your pilots. Each pilot can have zero or more specialties, depending \non experience level, and those skills can siginificantly increase his or her \neffectiveness. It takes good planning to match the right mech to the right \npilot.\n\nOn the full 3D battle field, you will control movement, targetting, and \nengagement tactics of your mechs. Call in support elements such as \nartillery and airstrikes, scout choppers and sensor probes, even a \nsalvage team to salvage downed mechs. Capture resource buildings or \nresource trucks for more &quot;support pts&quot;. Capture turret stations to turn \nthe owner's weapons against them, or blow up the generators, or the \ncontrol station, or the turrets. It's all up to you. Take over the sensor \ncontrol station to obtain sensor data. Capture military installations to \nget better weapons.\n\nThe action is in real-time (pausable), and the full 3D view is rotatable in \nall directions (up/down/full 360 pan) and zoomable. Terrain is full 3D with \nplenty of trees and other objects, from infantry and battlearmor to trucks \nand other transport vehicles. Plenty of things to blow up on the ground, \nfrom fuel tanks (which causes BIG explosions) to ammo dumps (more big \nexplosions), to plenty of civilian buildings.\n\nAfter you fulfill your mission objectives (primary and secondary available), \nthe pilots get medals and campaign ribbons if applicable based on \nperformance, and gain experience. If they gain sufficient experience they \nmay gain a level and win a special expertise (such as LRM, Laser, etc.) You \ncan also salvage downed mechs (including any you lost) and perhaps sell \nthem for further profit.\n\nMultiplayer is quite robust with internet play and plenty of options and \ndifferent game modes. \n\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image \n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\nKeep Image Mounted To Play Game\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e7efd7a7234d0357b181a27b78bad2789071825","amp;dn":"MechCommander.2.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e7efd7a7234d0357b181a27b78bad2789071825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,126,253,122,114,52,208,53,123,24,26,39,183,139,173,39,137,7,24,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
