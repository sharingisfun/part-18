Like his first two solo albums (1974's I'VE GOT MY OWN ALBUM TO DO and 1975's NOW LOOK), NECK boasts an all star guest list. \n\nThe list is long, but such renowned rockers as Dave Mason, Mick Fleetwood, Ian McLagan, and such fellow Stones members as Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and even the man Wood replaced in the Stones, Mick Taylor, appears. Featured are the previously unheard Bob Dylan original &quot;Seven Days&quot; and the guitar-heavy rocker &quot;Buried Alive.&quot; \n\nProducer Roy Thomas Baker keeps things simple (unlike his work with Queen and the Cars), which makes GIMME SOME NECK another tasty slice of fun and sloppy rock n' roll.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Worry No More\n02 - Breakin' My Heart\n03 - Delia\n04 - Buried Alive\n05 - Come To Realise\n06 - Infekshun\n07 - Seven Days\n08 - We All Get Old\n09 - F.U.C.
