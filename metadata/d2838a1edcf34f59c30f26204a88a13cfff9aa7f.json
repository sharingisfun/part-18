They were signed to Bieler Bros. Records.\n\n\nBurn Season formed in 2001, and immediately gained the attention of several major record labels. They ultimately decided to sign with Elektra Records to what was rumored as an &quot;obscenely&quot; large deal.\n\nThe band went to work recording their debut album with highly renowned producers Bob Marlette and Tim Palmer. However, during this time, many major record labels felt financial pressure, and Elektra was no exception. Ultimately, Burn Season were dropped, and their recorded album never saw the light of day.\n\nHowever, independent label, Bieler Bros. Records signed the band. They negotiated the rights to four songs from their unreleased Elektra record, and recorded eight new songs. After a long delay, Burn Season released their self-titled debut album on October 11, 2005. Bieler Bros. Records CEO, Jason Bieler, stated that:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \tThis band clearly had the talent and the songs to be huge. As Elektra folded...this was a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water; decisions were made on budgets and inter office politics, not on music. We know they're a great rock band and if it takes us 3 weeks or 3 years to break them, we're ready! \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe band was working on their new album, the title is unknown but 2 new songs can be heard in their purevolume.\n\nOn May 1st, 2007, Damien Starkey posted a MySpace bulletin, discussing the band breaking up. What he said was:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \tI'm sorry to break the news to everyone but we have officially broke up. After 6 years, 2 record deals, and over 40 recorded songs we feel that the band has run its course. All of us are still great friends and have no animosity within the group but have come to a point where it makes more sense to pursue other projects. We want to thank everyone across the country for all of your continued support and must tell you that i have had more fun out on tour w/ all of you than ive ever had in my life. This band has been my whole world for so long that it truly leaves an empty spot inside of me to think of it not existing anymore. But so be it. Bobby and I are continuing to pursue music as vigurously as ever w/ Adam and Kevin possibly doing the same in the future. So look out for more music soon as i am heading in the studio this month to debut the dozens of demoed songs that i have. Bobby also has another project in the makings so look out for that as well. Fuck, it really sucks to tell you guys all of this, but it had to be said. We love you guys and hope to see all of you at these 2 last shows. No matter where you live, if you can make it, we'd love to party one more time burn season style w/ you. \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAlso noted was that the final show was going to be on May 25th, at the first place the band ever played a show, called Jack Rabbits.\n\n\n    * Damien Starkey joined forces with Dizzi Devereaux, Paul Phillips (formerly of &quot;Puddle of Mudd&quot;), Brad Moxey, and Brad Stewart(formerly of &quot;Shinedown&quot;) to form another pulse-pounding group called &quot;Society Red&quot;. The band is currently performing at shows in Florida with others TBD. Songs of note include &quot;Love and Hate&quot;, &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;So Unhappy&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Show&quot;, &quot;High Life&quot;, and &quot;Chasing the Reason&quot;.\n\n\n    * Bobby Amaru went on to form his own band &quot;Amaru&quot;.\n\n\n--===VIPER666===--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2838a1edcf34f59c30f26204a88a13cfff9aa7f","amp;dn":"Burn+Season+-+Burn+Season+%282005%29+%5BVIPER666%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2838a1edcf34f59c30f26204a88a13cfff9aa7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,131,138,30,220,243,79,89,195,15,38,32,74,136,161,60,255,249,170,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
