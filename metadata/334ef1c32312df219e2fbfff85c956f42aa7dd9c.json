You're not fitting in with society; you're viewed as an outsider. There are a lot of social prohibitions about the outsider and the person who's going to upset things. From the time we're very young, we're taught to worship authority, basically, because that's our key to survival as young children. But as adults, we never go through the rights of passage that tell us how to methodically think for ourself, and thus we're always in a state of extended adolescence.\n\nWe take all this stuff, whether it's the television or it's the inculturation, the school yards, the teachers... we take this whole system, we put it into our unconscious mind, and it is the GIGO that comes out... Garbage In, Garbage Out. We simply have harnessed our own power by accepting all these beliefs as though they are factual, whether it's the flat earth of Columbus or it's the idea that I'm not good enough to be or to do something I've dreamed to do.\n\nTo the degree that the individual loses the sense of what freedom really means for him, mind control is working. Everybody's born into this control structure, everybody's born into authority. Everyone's born into the situation, but just because you have an authority making decisions for you at some point when you're very young, too young to take care of yourself, doesn't mean you should always cater to authority your whole life. We have established a framework which for the most part works pretty good. People enter into this contract with society. That contract allows them to follow certain rules and expect certain returns on their investment of working within the framework of the contract.\n\nHuman beings form habits. At some point in our lives, many of us realize that the lives we are living are not those which we have imagined, but rather lives reflecting others' imaginations, as if we have been unwitting actors in someone else's script. Can be the minds of individuals harnessed by systems of psychological control?\n\nAre the habits reflected by human beings in direct conflict with their needs to survive and thrive in this world? The enormous implications deter many of us from asking these simple questions and finding answers relevant to our daily lives. If we don't resist all of the different information that comes our way and weigh it and use our own mind instead of what somebody else wants us to think, eventually society would become nothing more than automatons, robots. The establishment has protected itself. Unless you submit to the saturation indoctrination and adopt all its values, you can't get in.

Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
