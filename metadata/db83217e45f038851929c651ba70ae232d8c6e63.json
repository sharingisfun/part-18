Amen?  I was doing just that this morning when I was listening to a recent SiriusXM Artist Confidential by Amy Grant.  It's included in today's bundle.  Her final song on that Artist Confidential was an old Rich Mullins song from the 1980's called &quot;Sing Your Praise To The Lord.&quot;  It's always been one of my favorite songs by Rich, just as he has equally been one of my favorite Artists.  Too bad the music world lost him in September of 1997.  But what a blessing he was, and inspiration to many while he was here recording his music.\n\nMy attempt at a genre breakdown for today's bundle might look something like this...  HIP-HOP/RAP: Alex Faith, Dee-1, Doc Jones, D-Tropp, Justin Moran, Lance Penland, Lyrics 1, Oracle, Shyne On Me, Various.  ROCK: Alter Bridge.  FOLK: Amos Lee.  BLUES: Brixtonboogie.  POP: Christina Grimmie, Dave Barnes, David Gaulton, Jonny Diaz, Rapture Ruckus.  PRAISE &amp; WORSHIP: Gateway Next, Keith Elgin, Maranatha Music, Marilyn Mann, Richard Jensen.  GOSPEL: Kirk Franklin, Stubborn Love, The Wisecarvers.  CONTEMPORARY: Koo Chung, Sara Groves.  ROCK: Kutless, Righteous Vendetta, Take Part.
