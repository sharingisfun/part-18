Has God Seen My Shadow? An Anthology 1989-2011 is a collection that brings together 20 outstanding performances from LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums for Sub Pop and Beggars Banquet, and also features 12 previously unreleased tracks from LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s archives. The physical editions of this set also include a booklet with reproductions of LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original handwritten lyrics.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e065b710b7d6aeb373ee504659dfdb641e39ad06","amp;dn":"Mark+Lanegan+-+Has+God+Seen+My+Shadow+%5B2CD%5D+An+Anthology+%282014%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e065b710b7d6aeb373ee504659dfdb641e39ad06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,101,183,16,183,214,174,179,115,238,80,70,89,223,219,100,30,57,173,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
