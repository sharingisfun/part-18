Rock impresario Bill Graham said of Money, &quot;Eddie Money has it all.... Not only can he sing, write, and play, but he is a natural performer.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEddie Money is the self titled debut album by American musician Eddie Money, originally released in 1977.\n\nContaining two songs that achieved generous radio airplay (&quot;Two Tickets to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Baby Hold On&quot;), the album peaked at #37 on the charts, establishing Money as a successful artist. &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise&quot; remains one of his most frequently played songs.\n\nThis album features Money on vocals, Jimmy Lyon on guitar, saxophone player Tom Scott, and former Steve Miller bassist Lonnie Turner.
