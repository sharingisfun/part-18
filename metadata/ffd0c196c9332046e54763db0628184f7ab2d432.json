The treasure is hidden on a mysterious Cutthroat Island. Unfortunately, the final portion is held by her villainous uncle, Douglas ('Dawg') Brown (Frank Langella). Her crew is skeptical of her leadership abilities, so she must complete her quest before they mutiny against her. This is made more difficult by the efforts of the Royal Navy from Jamaica under the command of the self-serving Governor Ainslee (Patrick Malahide) to end her piratical career. On her ship, Morning Star, Morgan starts the voyage to Cutthroat Island.\n\nDuration :2:03:53\n\nDimensions 720 x 544 NTSC\n\nSize 699MB\n\nGood movie i hope you enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffd0c196c9332046e54763db0628184f7ab2d432","amp;dn":"CutThroat+Island","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffd0c196c9332046e54763db0628184f7ab2d432","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,208,193,150,201,51,32,70,229,71,99,219,6,40,24,79,122,178,212,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
