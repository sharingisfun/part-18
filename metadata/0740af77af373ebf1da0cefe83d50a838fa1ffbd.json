With burns on one hundred percent of his body, Oâ€™Leary mustered an almost unimaginable amount of inner strength just to survive the ordeal. The insights he gained through this experience and the heroes who stepped into his life to help him through the journeyâ€”his family, the medical staff, and total strangersâ€”changed his life. Now he is committed to living life to the fullest and inspiring others to do the same.\r\n\r\nAn incredible and emotionally honest account of triumph over tragedy, On Fire contains Oâ€™Learyâ€™s reflections on being that little boy, the life-giving choices made then, and the resulting lessons he learned. Oâ€™Leary very clearly shares that without the right people providing the right guidance, at the right time, he never would have made it through those five months in the hospital, let alone the years that followed as he struggled to regain mobility, embrace his story, and ignite clarity of his lifeâ€™s purpose.\r\n\r\nOn Fire encourages us to seize the power to choose our path and transform our lives from mundane to extraordinary. Once we stop thinking solely on the big moments in our lives, we can begin to focus on those smaller opportunities that tend to pass us by. These are the eventsâ€”the inflection points in our livesâ€”that can determine how we feel about life now, where we are headed in the future, and how many lives we can impact along the way. We canâ€™t always choose the path we walk, but we can choose how we walk it. Empowering, inspiring, remarkably honest, and heartfelt, Oâ€™Learyâ€™s strength and incredible spirit shine through on every page","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0740af77af373ebf1da0cefe83d50a838fa1ffbd","amp;dn":"On+Fire+-+John+O%27Leary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0740af77af373ebf1da0cefe83d50a838fa1ffbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,64,175,119,175,55,62,191,29,160,206,254,131,213,10,131,143,161,255,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
