I shall be active as often as possible but NOT 24/7.\n\nap20110704 DITCHED 1-2, Doug Lucie .mp3\nap20110705 DITCHED 2-2, Doug Lucie .mp3\nap20110706 WHENEVER I GET BLOWN UP I THINK OF YOU.mp3\nap20110707 LIFE BEGINS AT CRAWLEY, Roy Apps.mp3\nap20110708 GILDA AND HER DAUGHTERS-LOOKING FOR GOLDIE.mp3\nap20110711  TORCHWOOD - LF 1 THE DEVIL AND MISS CAREW.mp3\nap20110712  TORCHWOOD - LF 2 SUBMISSION .mp3\nap20110713  TORCHWOOD - LF 3 HOUSE OF THE DEAD.mp3\nap20110714 BEST INTERESTS (Ethics 1), Sasha Hails.mp3\nap20110718 SMOKE AND DAGGERS, Hugh Costello.mp3\nap20110719 GETTING TO ZERO, Sarah Woods.mp3\nap20110720 ROCK OF EYE, Anita Sullivan.mp3\nap20110721 POSITIVE (Ethics 2), Tina Pepler.mp3\nap20110722 CRY BABIES, Kim Newman.mp3\nap20110725 A9, Helen Cooper.mp3\nap20110726 DEAR WRITER, Jane Rogers.mp3\nap20110727  IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, Simenon 1-3.mp3\nap20110728 WELCOME TO THE WASTELAND, DJ Britton.mp3\nap20110729 DELOREAN, Glenn Patterson.mp3 \n \nfp20110702 STONE #3 -  DEAD FISHES, Chloe Moss.mp3\nfp20110709 STONE #4 GODS WITNESS, Danny Brocklehurst.mp3 \n  \nsp20110702 THE ADMIRABLE CHRICHTON, JM Barrie.mp3\nsp20110702 WHITE NIGHTS [crime], Ann Cleeves.mp3\nsp20110709 THE PENNY DREADFULS PRESENT REVOLUTION.mp3\nsp20110716 THE PURPLE LAND, WH Auden.mp3\nsp20110723 PLAYING WITH FIRE, David Edgar.mp3\nsp20110730 THE GREAT TENNESSEE MONKEY TRIAL.mp3\n \nDonleavy :-)\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece0ca16fe3f2d9d8a3073894454e3ae890865d3","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+Plays+2011-07%28Jul%29+Donleavy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece0ca16fe3f2d9d8a3073894454e3ae890865d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,224,202,22,254,63,45,157,138,48,115,137,68,84,227,174,137,8,101,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
