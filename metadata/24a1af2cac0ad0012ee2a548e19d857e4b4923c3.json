The\nbest of the free software, the best of the commercial software, and it all fits on\none CD-R that's readable by any computer worth booting on. Not everything can read\na DVD, and USB booting is hit and miss at best.\n\nThis is the Ultimate Boot CD that I've used myself, and all the combined tools I\nuse for PC diagnostics at the shop I work at. It's been part of my toolbox for\nyears.With the release of Hiren's BootCD 9.7, the entire playing field has been\nshifted, with the new MiniXP boot functionality. It's a 30mb image that loads and\ndecompresses into RAM, then boots Windows off RAM at lightning speed - including\nreading to RAM, it appears to boot even faster than off a hard drive... and still\ngives you network (and internet) functionality on many PCs. Many drivers for net\nand SATA are built right in, but you can load anything with the F6 driver prompt\nduring startup.\n\nHiren's XP BootCD is an extremely useful diagnostic tool, and is at the heart of\nthis BootCD. However, several techs (myself included) have found issues with the\nlack of easy access to the multitude of tools on the disc, so I modified the disk\nimage to add shortcuts to many popular applications right on the desktop, and\nadded a shiny wallpaper :P . More applications can be found by browsing the CD's\n&quot;PROGRAMS&quot; folder.\n\nMany techs use ERD Commander, which (after the Microsoft acquisition) is now\nknown as Microsoft DaRT - the Diagnostic and Recovery Toolkit. It's a considerably\nsmaller (than Hiren/UBCD4Win) set of extremely useful and specialized tools to\nrepair Windows. I've repackaged the XP version into a lightning-fast-booting\ncompressed RAM disk, and added DaRT 6.0 for Windows Vista. Both versions include\ntools like Offline System Restore, System File Checker, and Crash Analyzer.\n\nIf you work in a tech shop, you know the pain of user passwords. The typical order\nof business would be to use NTPWEdit to erase the login passwords (replaces Active\nPassword Changer). However, Kon-Boot actually patches the Windows kernel in RAM\nduring startup, causing it to ignore an incorrect password at login! You can log in\nwithout entering the user's password, perform your tech duties, shut the system off,\nand their password stays intact. It's still an experimental tool, and often fails to\nstart on many computers, but it's a great new tool that makes a valuable addition to\na tech toolkit.\n\nOnce you dive into this disc, you'll never need another boot CD.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n                                O N   T H E   D I S C                              |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nHiren's XP 9.9 + MyDefrag 4.0 w/ FalconFour's FullOptimize script, fix_hdc, HD Tune\n        Pro, desktop icons, Taskmgr as task manager\nMisc apps: Active File Recovery, Keyfinder, Victoria for Windows, windirstat,\n        ImgBurn 2.5\nHiren's DOS 9.9 + SpinRite 6.0 (under Hard Disk Tools)\nERD Commander / Microsoft DaRT 5.0 (WinXP)\nMS DaRT 6.0 (Vista)\nDell MBR Recovery Disk\nMemtest86+ 2.11\nKon-Boot 1.1\nWindows Recovery Console","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24a1af2cac0ad0012ee2a548e19d857e4b4923c3","amp;dn":"FalconFour%5C%27s+Ultimate+Boot+CD%2FUSB+2.0+-+Hiren%5C%27s+9.9%2C+ERD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24a1af2cac0ad0012ee2a548e19d857e4b4923c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,161,175,44,172,10,208,1,46,226,165,72,225,157,133,126,75,73,35,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
