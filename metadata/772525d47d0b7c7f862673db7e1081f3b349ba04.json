Not only that, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tim BurtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s version of Wonderland, so you know itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be colorful! In fact, the graphics are SO colorful in this game, they almost make you want to believe in magic again. Everything from the characters (who actually resemble the actors in the movie) to the environments look very magical, and the voiceovers in the game are phenomenal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ most of them are done by the actual filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actors and actresses. By playing this game, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll probably get a glimpse into what watching the movie will be like.\n\nFirst upload for me  please comment\n\nRegion :  usa\n\nTested on Drivekey, neogamma, and USB loader GX   4.2 U\n\ncant speak for others SO PLEASE LEAVE COMMENT   thanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:772525d47d0b7c7f862673db7e1081f3b349ba04","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Wonderland++usa+WII++NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"772525d47d0b7c7f862673db7e1081f3b349ba04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,37,37,212,125,11,124,127,134,38,115,219,126,16,129,243,179,73,186,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
