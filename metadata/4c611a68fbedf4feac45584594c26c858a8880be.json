But I knew I wasn't imagining things when I found one in my kitchen baking muffins. I'd seen him before: lurking in my closet, scaring the crap out of my five-year-old self. Turns out that was a misunderstanding, and now Maurice needs a place to stay. How could I say no?\n\nAfter all, I've always been a magnet for the emotionally needy, and not just in my work as a wedding planner. Being able to sense the feelings of others can be a major pain. Don't get me wrong, I like helping people--and non-people. But this ability has turned me into a gourmet feast for an incubus, a demon that feeds off emotional energy. Now, brides are dropping dead all over town, and my home has become a safe house for the supernatural. I must learn to focus my powers and defeat the demon before he snacks on another innocent woman and comes looking for the main course...\n\nPooka in my Pantry\nZoey DonovanÃ¢â‚¬â€empath, wedding planner, go-to girl for monsters with personal problemsÃ¢â‚¬â€has been marked twice for pickup by Death. On both occasions, Riley the smoking-hot reaper has refused to follow through. For his breach of protocol, Riley is now on probation. For her refusal to die on schedule, Zoey's right to live is challenged. She will have to undergo a life-or-death trial, but she won't know when or where it will happenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nStaying alive might not be so difficult if the Leprechaun Mafia hadn't strolled into town. Now every business owner with the slightest connection to the supernatural community is being threatened with the most appalling bad luck if they don't pay up. Mirrors are smashed, bodies are dropping, and Zoey's still got clients waiting for fabric samples.\n\nWith a little luck, she might be able to save everyone and still have time for a second attempt at a decent first date with her favorite reaper.\n\nFairies in my Fireplace\nA migration of mythical creatures has begun, and more and more of them are landing on Zoey Donovan's doorstep. As the only Aegis left in the country, it falls to her to protect the Hidden and keep them safe-and her house has become a sanctuary for water sprites, goblins, harpies, djinn and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c611a68fbedf4feac45584594c26c858a8880be","amp;dn":"Monster+Haven+books+1-3+by+RL+Naquin+%28.ePUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c611a68fbedf4feac45584594c26c858a8880be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,97,26,104,251,237,244,254,172,69,88,69,148,194,108,133,138,136,128,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
