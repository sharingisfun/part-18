Dark nights aren't all though, much thought has been put into selecting the correct lighting colours for each time of the day so at mid-day it feels very bright but as the day draws to a close, all objects gradually take on a warmer feel until sunset where everything takes on a lovely orange glow, then before you know it, the sun dips, the glow gradually fades with no sudden changes and night descends through dusk as the signals fast become the only things you can truly make out; just like a real train driver.\n\nSeasonal differences have also been taken into account. For example, realistic sunrise/sunset times and dusk lengths (for the south of the UK) are used for each season. As well as this, the height of the sun has been changed to prototypical values so in the winter it is low whilst in the summer, high.\n\nFinally, this pack also reduces the blue fog in clear conditions that tends to dominate too much in Train Simulator 2014.\n\nPictures speak louder than words though so feel free to check out the screenshots to the left.\n\nAs well as environmental lighting, this pack has been updated to include new and improved signal light textures for the default UK colour light signals and tradtional bulb 'UK Pro' signals (as seen in Edinburgh to Glasgow &amp; London to Brighton). Check out the screenshots to the left to see this improvement in action.\n\nDuring installation, these lighting effects will be applied to the following routes:\n\nBristol to Exeter\n\nCajon Pass\n\nCastle Rock Railroad\n\nCologne - Dusseldorf\n\nDonnor Pass Southern Pacific\n\nEast Coast Main Line\n\nEast Coast Main Line: London - Peterborough\n\nEdinburgh to Glasgow\n\nGreat Eastern Main Line\n\nGreat Western Main Line\n\nHamburg to Hanover\n\nHedborough North\n\nThe Isle of Wight\n\nLondon to Brighton\n\nLondon to Faversham\n\nMarias Pass\n\nThe Maerdy Branch\n\nMunich to Augsburg\n\nNewcastle to York (Modern)\n\nNortheast Corridor\n\nPortsmouth Direct Line\n\nThe Port Road\n\nRuhr Sieg Line\n\nSeebergbahn\n\nSettle to Carlisle\n\nSomerset Dorset Joint Railway\n\nTestTraK\n\nWCML North\n\nWCML over Shap\n\nWest Somerset Railway\n\nWestern Lines Of Scotland\n\nWoodhead\n\nWe shall endeavour to update this pack whenever new routes are released.\n\n\nTHIS HAVE THE LATEST UPDATED ROUTES ENJOY AND SEED PEOPLE!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2159854069f75e39fe860c42ed4cb6064d5631","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+AP+Lighting+Effects+Enhancement+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2159854069f75e39fe860c42ed4cb6064d5631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,33,89,133,64,105,247,94,57,254,134,12,66,237,76,182,6,77,86,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
