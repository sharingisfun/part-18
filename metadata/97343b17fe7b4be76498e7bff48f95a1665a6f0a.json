Featuring Sonny Charles - Love Is All We Have To Give 1969 (Black Pearl)\nCD (2000) To Mp3 256 mbit/s\nIncluded: CD Covers and this Info\n\nCheckmates, Ltd. were an American R&amp;B group from Fort Wayne, Indiana. The group, discovered by Nancy Wilson, included both black and white members; their one major hit was 1969's &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, produced by Phil Spector. The song peaked at #13 on the U.S. pop chart.\n\nThe group broke up in 1970, but reunited in 1974 for a few more years. Lead singer Sonny Charles later had a moderately successful career as a solo artist. Charles and Smith later reunited and toured the U.S. into the 2000s. Some of the duo's highlights included performing with Frank Sinatra at the Oakland Coliseum, a concert at Madison Square Garden with Herb Alpert, and singing the National anthem for the 'Thrilla in Manila,' the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier heavyweight championship boxing match in the Philippines in 1975.\n\n&quot;Sweet Louie&quot; Smith (born Marvin Smith) died of a heart attack on 15 December 2007, while on a cruise ship in the Caribbean where he was to perform. He was 68    &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmates,_Ltd.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmates,_Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Love Is All We Have To Give&quot;  Review   by Joe Viglione  Allmusic.com\n&quot;Black Pearl&quot; is one of the great Phil Spector productions, a phenomenal song with his extraordinary sound. That being said, it would be easy to try to dismiss this excellent album and focus just on the hit. That's the wonderful paradox of Love Is All We Have to Give by the Checkmates, Ltd. and Sonny Charles. Charles only re-scratched the Top 40 once (and that in 1983), but it is this album which showcases his major voice. The Leiber &amp; Stoller composition &quot;I Keep Forgettin'&quot; has that sound from the 1966 Billy Stewart hit version of Gershwin's &quot;Summertime&quot; without the scat singing. Spector's remake of his own 1961 classic for Ben E. King, &quot;Spanish Harlem,&quot; fits perfectly here, while &quot;Proud Mary,&quot; the simple John Fogerty title, becomes a gospel tour de force falling somewhere between Tina Turner and the Edwin Hawkin Singers. The indomitable Perry Botkin, Jr., who would hit seven years later with &quot;Nadia's Theme&quot; (aka &quot;The Young &amp; the Restless&quot;), arranges and conducts side one with assistance from Dee Barton. Side two is another kettle of fish. Barton arranges Spector's adaption of &quot;The Hair Anthology Suite&quot; from the play Hair, most notably the material made famous by the 5th Dimension (&quot;Age of Aquarius&quot;/&quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot;). Though both artists probably tracked it around the same time -- the 5th Dimension hitting in March and &quot;Black Pearl&quot; hitting in May 1969 -- there is none of the life here that Marilyn McCoo, Billy Davis, Jr., and their group put into their first number one hit. Like a classic Spector 45, this album has one side that is totally inspired and brilliant, and a flip that won't get as many spins. All in all, it's a very important, and largely forgotten, bridge in Spector's catalog and his only hit in America on A&amp;M, the same label he brought the Ronettes and Ike &amp; Tina Turner's classic &quot;River Deep, Mountain High.&quot; \n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
