It contains one track which was performed live on the Kukl's TV show (studio version) and another track which was used by Gudlaugur Ottarsson for his &quot;Dense Time&quot; album (this is the original without mixing). I'm not sure those had ever been circulated and its a shame I can't burn those fine tracks. I'll try my best if they're in demand, but they must exist somewhere else....\n\nBut please enjoy these KUKL tracks nevertheless.\n\nPlease check out and seed my other rare icelandic new-wave music as well....tah\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42004357fcc70f485d70d66546c4b92f1db04119","amp;dn":"KUKL+-+RUV+Radio+Demos+%2B+Live+Pandora%5C%27s+Box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42004357fcc70f485d70d66546c4b92f1db04119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,0,67,87,252,199,15,72,93,112,214,101,70,196,185,47,29,176,65,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
