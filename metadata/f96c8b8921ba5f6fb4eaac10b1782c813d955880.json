After the Boston Tea Party, British and American soldiers and Massachusetts residents have warily maneuvered around each other until April 19, when violence finally erupts at Lexington and Concord. In June, however, with the city cut off from supplies by a British blockade and Patriot militia poised in siege, skirmishes give way to outright war in the Battle of Bunker Hill. It would be the bloodiest battle of the Revolution to come, and the point of no return for the rebellious colonists.\nPhilbrick brings a fresh perspective to every aspect of the story. He finds new characters, and new facets to familiar ones. The real work of choreographing rebellion falls to a thirty-three year old physician named Joseph Warren who emerges as the on-the-ground leader of the Patriot cause and is fated to die at Bunker Hill. Others in the cast include Paul Revere, WarrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiancÃƒÂ© the poet Mercy Scollay, a newly recruited George Washington, the reluctant British combatant General Thomas Gage and his more bellicose successor William Howe, who leads the three charges at Bunker Hill and presides over the claustrophobic cauldron of a city under siege as both sides play a nervy game of brinkmanship for control.\n\nWith passion and insight, Philbrick reconstructs the revolutionary landscapeÃ¢â‚¬â€geographic and ideologicalÃ¢â‚¬â€in a mesmerizing narrative of the robust, messy, blisteringly real origins of America.\n\nThe Washington Post - Walter Isaacson\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a tightly focused and richly detailed narrativeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Histories of America's birth tend to glorify the founding fathersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦who gathered in a stately hall in Philadelphia to debate whether to declare independence. But Philbrick's focus is on Boston, where that decision was sealed a year earlier by passionate rebels and trigger-happy rabble-rousers. The cityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦is the book's main protagonistÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Philbrick is at his most vivid in conveying scenes of battle, both on the road between Boston and Concord and on the ridges of Bunker Hill. But what adds depth to the narrative is his fine sense of the ambitions that drive people in war and politics.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nNational Book Award winner and Pulitzer Prize finalist Philbrick (Why Read Moby-Dick, 2011, etc.) will be a candidate for another award with this ingenious, bottom-up look at Boston from the time of the December 1773 Tea Party to the iconic June 1775 battle. Independence Day rhetoric extols our forefathers' battle for freedom against tyranny and unfair taxation, but the author points out that American colonists were the freest, most-prosperous and least-taxed subjects of the British Empire and perhaps the world. A century and a half of London's salutary neglect had resulted in 13 nearly independent colonies. Trouble began in the 1760s when Parliament attempted to tax them to help pay for the ruinously expensive victory in the French and Indian War. Unexpected opposition handled with spectacular clumsiness by Britain guaranteed trouble. Among Massachusetts' resistance leaders, most readers know John Hancock and Samuel Adams, but Philbrick concentrates on Joseph Warren, a charismatic young physician, unjustly neglected today since he died at Bunker Hill. His opposite number, British Gen. Thomas Gage, behaved with remarkable restraint. Despite warnings that it would take massive reinforcements to keep the peace, superiors in London goaded him into action, resulting in the disastrous April 1775 expedition to Lexington and Concord. They also sent a more pugnacious general, William Howe, who decided to expel colonial militias, now besieging Boston, by an uphill frontal attack on their entrenched lines, a foolish tactic. British forces succeeded but suffered massive casualties. It was the first and bloodiest engagement of the eight years of fighting that followed. A rewarding approach to a well-worn subject, rich in anecdotes, opinion, bloodshed and Byzantine political maneuvering.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96c8b8921ba5f6fb4eaac10b1782c813d955880","amp;dn":"Nathaniel+Philbrick+-+Bunker+Hill-+A+City%2C+a+Siege%2C+a+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96c8b8921ba5f6fb4eaac10b1782c813d955880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,108,139,137,33,186,95,111,180,234,172,16,177,120,44,129,61,149,88,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
