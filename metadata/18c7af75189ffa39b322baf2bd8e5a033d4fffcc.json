The album took its title from the Deep Purple song &quot;Child in Time&quot;, a version of which appears on side two of the LP. The album reached No. 36 on Swedish charts and No. 55 in UK. \n\nThis was Ian Gillan's first release after leaving Deep Purple, and also features his former Deep Purple colleague Roger Glover. Before Ian returned full-time to the rock music industry, he made one brief, but significant, live appearance on the performance of Roger Glover's &quot;The Butterfly Ball&quot;, on 16 October 1975 at Royal Albert Hall, London. Ian sang &quot;Sitting in a Dream&quot;. A film of the event was originally shown in UK cinemas in 1977. Later released on video, it was quickly deleted.\n\nAlthough not credited with playing on the album, Dave Wintour (bass player), Andy Steele (drummer) and Bernie Holland (guitarist), are listed among the songs' composers. In fact, Gillan had been recording demo tapes with non-Deep Purple material as early as 1972, and some of the Child in Time material was taken from the period September 1972 to April 1974. Parts of these early sessions can be heard on the Ian Gillan CD &quot;cherkazoo and other stories&quot; released in 1992 and on the DVD bonus tracks from &quot;Live at the Rainbow 1977&quot;.\n\nThe album was recorded at Musicland Studios, Munich between December 1975 and January 1976 and mixed at Mountain Studio, Montreux, in February 1976. One single was released from the album, &quot;You Make Me Feel So Good&quot;/&quot;Shame&quot; in the UK in July 1976, on the Oyster label.\n\nAlthough Ian Gillan Band went on to produce material more suited to their jazz-rock label, this first album has much more of a harder rhythm and blues style.\n\nThe album was reissued on CD when Virgin Records reissued the entire Ian Gillan Band catalogue in 1989\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n    &quot;Lay Me Down&quot; (Ian Gillan, Ray Fenwick, Nauseef, Gustafson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n    &quot;You Make Me Feel So Good&quot; (Gillan, Moran, Wintour,Holland) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41\n    &quot;Shame&quot; (Gillan, Fenwick, Nauseef, Gustafson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:47\n    &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot; (Gillan, Fenwick, Nauseef, Roger Glover) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:35\n    &quot;Down the Road&quot; (Gillan, Fenwick, Nauseef, Gustafson, Glover) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:27\n    &quot;Child in Time&quot; (Blackmore, Gillan, Glover,Lord, Ian Paice) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:23\n    &quot;Let It Slide&quot; (Gillan, Fenwick, Nauseef, Gustafson, Moran) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:41\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18c7af75189ffa39b322baf2bd8e5a033d4fffcc","amp;dn":"Ian+Gillan+Band+-+Child+In+Time+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18c7af75189ffa39b322baf2bd8e5a033d4fffcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,199,175,117,24,159,250,57,179,34,186,242,189,142,90,3,61,79,255,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
