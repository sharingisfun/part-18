In fact, with a tally of 16, he has won more Brits than any other artist since the awards began, including 'Angels' being voted the best single of the last 25 years. A plethora of other record-breaking awards include a Guinness World Record for fastest ever ticket sales, coupled with the honour of playing the largest open-air concert in UK history, at Knebworth in 2003 have meant that his status as a live performer has equalled his massive achievements as a recording artist.\n\nRobbie's current studio album Reality Killed The Video Star was released in the UK in November last year and has now sold a million copies in the UK alone. The album also achieved the third highest week 1 sales of any album in the UK last year, narrowly beaten by JLS and the phenomenon that is Susan Boyle.\n\nRobbie Williams said: &quot;It's incredible to listen to the album and realise that it's already been 20 years of making music and playing gigs. And the great thing about the album is that it's not only a celebration of my past but also a bridge to the future. The fact that part of the future includes a name from my past makes it all the more poignant for me&quot;.\n\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\nDisc 1\n\n   1.
