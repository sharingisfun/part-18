This course will help you get started with the language in no time. We will cover installing a web server, PHP, and the MySQL database server. Then we will process form data and later store everything in a MySQL database. We will take special care about common security-related pitfalls and will avoid common attacks. Finally, we will develop a small sample application which also features authentication and authorization. This course does not provide a complete introduction into the language syntax, so knowledge of any programming language is beneficial but you will be able to pick up the rest!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5da667a56c3e3c2740b83759ffa86a8f3f692b2c","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+PHP+Get+Started","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5da667a56c3e3c2740b83759ffa86a8f3f692b2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,166,103,165,108,62,60,39,64,184,55,89,255,168,106,143,63,105,43,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
