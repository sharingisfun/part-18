The film was half-complete at this point. You'll see a lot of finished scenes, including a few that don't appear in the final movie, but you'll also see scenes which are only storyboard drawings. There is a lot of temporary audio and music. Oogie Boogie's scenes, for example, aren't ready yet - they're storyboards, with temporary audio on his song, which is a longer version probably sung by Danny Elfman. &quot;Making Christmas&quot; is also just storyboards with an extra verse. The final confrontation between Jack and Oogie (and pretty much the entire ending) is also just storyboards, and a bit vague compared to the final film.\n\n   Quality here is from a 4th-generation VHS (or so) but is watchable.\n\n   A rare treat for fans who want to see the process behind this great film.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e40b49a8c11d48cce009364ecfaec6c61632f4","amp;dn":"The+Nightmare+Before+Christmas+Workprint+1993+Tim+Burton+Disney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e40b49a8c11d48cce009364ecfaec6c61632f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,228,11,73,168,193,29,72,204,224,9,54,78,207,174,198,198,22,50,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
