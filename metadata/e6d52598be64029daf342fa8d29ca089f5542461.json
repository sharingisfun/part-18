This recommendation was powerful given that McCartney and Lennon were the most successful rock music composing team of the era, as well as being members of the most successful rock group of all time. Paul and John's recommendation characterized Nilsson; he was the singer and songwriter that other singers and songwriters admired. While Nilsson was not as popular as many of his contemporaries, he had his contemporaries' admiration, and many of his contemporaries covered his compositions.  \nThis a terrific overview of one of the most powerful singer/songwriters of the seventies.  Nilsson did not have a lot of hits, but he was a prolific songwriter and many artists covered his songs, including Three Dog Night (they had their first Top 10 hit with &quot;One&quot;), David Cassidy (He had a U.K. No. 1 with &quot;The Puppy Song&quot;), Blood Sweat and Tears (who recorded &quot;Without Her&quot; for their debut), and the Monkees (&quot;Cuddly Toy&quot;).\nOddly, two of Nilsson's biggest hits &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Talkin'&quot; which became the theme song to &quot;Midnight Cowboy,&quot; were written by other composers.  \nWhile Nilsson may not have been a superstar in terms of hits or record sales, he was one of the best artists of the decade. This collection is a fitting tribute to an artist who deserves wider recognition.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] 1941\n[02] Cuddly Toy\n[03] Without Her\n[04] One\n[05] Everybody's Talkin'\n[06] Girlfriend\n[07] Good Old Desk\n[08] I Guess The Lord Must Be In New York City\n[09] The Puppy Song\n[10] Living Without You\n[11] Me And My Arrow\n[12] Without You\n[13] Coconut\n[14] Jump Into The Fire\n[15] The Moonbeam Song\n[16] Remember (Christmas)\n[17] Spaceman\n[18] You're Breakin' My Heart\n[19] Daybreak\n[20] Don't Forget Me\n[21] As Time Goes By\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:02m:37s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 155mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
