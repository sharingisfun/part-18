Now Wright attempts something even more ambitious: explaining the direction of evolution and human historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and discerning where history will lead us next.\n\nIn Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, Wright asserts that, ever since the primordial ooze, life has followed a basic pattern. Organisms and human societies alike have grown more complex by mastering the challenges of internal cooperation. Wright's narrative ranges from fossilized bacteria to vampire bats, from stone-age villages to the World Trade Organization, uncovering such surprises as the benefits of barbarian hordes and the useful stability of feudalism. Here is history endowed with moral significanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“a way of looking at our biological and cultural evolution that suggests, refreshingly, that human morality has improved over time, and that our instinct to discover meaning may itself serve a higher purpose. Insightful, witty, profound, Nonzero offers breathtaking implications for what we believe and how we adapt to technology's ongoing transformation of the world.\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:389d7cef4e8de6c3d2baa2c07d4c63347ccdf63c","amp;dn":"Nonzero+The+Logic+of+Human+Destiny+-+Robert+Wright.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"389d7cef4e8de6c3d2baa2c07d4c63347ccdf63c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,157,124,239,78,141,230,195,210,186,162,192,125,76,99,52,124,205,246,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
