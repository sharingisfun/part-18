In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and other arts. It is organised by Michael Eavis on his own land, Worthy Farm in Pilton. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.\n\nthanks to capper and poster ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caedece5b843fbcc7e9a29d2ffc7a81b8fb5576b","amp;dn":"Glastonbury+2014+Day+1+Highlights+HDTV+x264-TVCUK+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caedece5b843fbcc7e9a29d2ffc7a81b8fb5576b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,237,236,229,184,67,251,204,126,154,41,210,255,199,168,27,143,181,87,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
