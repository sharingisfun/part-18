Amateur or professional, beginner or old-timer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will\ncherish, and watch over and over again.\n\nThe first one is about Harry LorayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classics, and classics\nthey are. Nowhere else will you see Harry perform and teach his\nAMAZING REVELATION DISPLAY Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is a great piece of card\nmagic.\n\nAnd hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only place youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see the performance of his\nINVISIBLE PASS ROUTINE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and he teaches you how to do it!\nDo you want a non-sleight-of-hand card miracle? You have it\nhere in his AMAZING PREDICTION. And youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll love his handling\nof the $1 bill RIP-STORATION.\n\nNone of these are on any other video. But also included are\nthese other Lorayne classics: IMPROMPTU LINKING CARD\nROUTINE, SNAP! (rubber band little miracle), THE LORAYNE\nSPREAD CONTROL, ULTRA MOVE, HaLo CUT.\n\nOn Magic Video #2 youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also see and learn effects and\nroutines that are not on any other video. TOGETHER AT LAST\nis a beauty, and if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t learn MONTE MONTE PLUS, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll\nmiss out on the best monte routine weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen (which\ndoes not use the too-well-known Ã¢â‚¬Å“hopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ move).\n\nSILKNOT and IMPOSSIBLE 2-CARD LOCATION are each worth\nthe price of any video out there today.\n\nThen thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s THE RIBBON-SPREAD PALM, KINGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S HIGHWAY,\nand SPREAD PASS DELAY. And if that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough, Harry\ndemonstrates and teaches SALT-LESS, DOUBLE PANCAKE\nREVELATION, HAN PING CHIEN FINESSE (and Ã¢â‚¬Å“finesseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ it is),\nEASY INDICATOR and THE TOP-CARD COVER PASS.\nThese alone are more than you get on other magic videos Ã¢â‚¬â€œ\nand nowhere else do you get Harry Lorayne!\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also see Harry perform CARD SHARP &amp; FOUR\nGAMBLERS for a lay audience. Watch closely to see how he\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“setsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a shuffled deck. This is a performance only. Harry\nteaches it on volume 3 of his &quot;Best Ever&quot; 4-volume DVD set.\nYou can check that out on this site.\n\nAlso included (performance and explanation): THE STING, THE\nORLAM SUBTLETY, THE STATUS QUO SHUFFLE, THE\nCHARLIER SHUFFLE, NO GET-READY DOUBLE LIFT FROM\nFOUR CARDS, THE UNIVERSAL REVERSAL, PARA-\nPSYCHOLOGY, SECRET SUBTRACTION MOVE, RED/BLACK\nSHUFFLE, A GREAT 4-ACE LOCATION, TO CATCH AN ACE\n#5, THE FLIP-UP DOUBLE LIFT, THE HaLo CUT, SLIP CUT TO\nTABLE, A DOUBLE-LIFT FINESSE.\n\nYou always get more than your moneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth with a Harry\nLorayne product. These two videos are perfect examples of\nthat!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8d65c58e055d2f14159e70d3b2145a4324db8f","amp;dn":"Harry+Lorayne+Magical+Classics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8d65c58e055d2f14159e70d3b2145a4324db8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,141,101,197,142,5,93,47,20,21,158,112,211,178,20,90,67,36,219,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
