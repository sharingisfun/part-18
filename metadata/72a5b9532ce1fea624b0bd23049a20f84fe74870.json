But they made a resurgence with this The track that got me into it was the title track good solid tune for the time also on the release was Come dancing which grabbed MTV attention and went into Hot rotation,myself did not really care for it but what the hell there were plenty of tracks which I did like, so everybody got what they needed,now lets see if it can get seeded. I know this and for the most part outside of hits packages and towering 2-3 or more GB torrents its not real accessable of course you can click on a giant torrent and open the file window and isolate certain pieces but thats not to cool. For the obvious reasons. Anyway enough rambling lets get to it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a5b9532ce1fea624b0bd23049a20f84fe74870","amp;dn":"The+Kinks-State+of+Confusion+320kbps+mp3+CBR+%28ak6103%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a5b9532ce1fea624b0bd23049a20f84fe74870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,165,185,83,44,225,254,166,36,176,189,35,4,154,32,248,79,231,72,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
