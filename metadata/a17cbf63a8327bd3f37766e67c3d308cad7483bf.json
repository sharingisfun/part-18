This 1997 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; \ncompilation truly lives up to its title as it includes nearly \nevery big hit Marx had during his successful heyday.\n\nMellow rock classics such as &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot;, \n&quot;Now and Forever&quot;,&quot;Hazard&quot;, &quot;Angelia&quot; and Marx's signature \nballad &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; are included here alongside the \nmore aggressive hits &quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot;, &quot;Take This Heart&quot;, \n&quot;Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Should've Known Better&quot;. \n\nIt's telling that Richard Marx broke into the music business \nsinging backup vocals for Lionel Richie and writing songs with \nKenny Rogers and Chicago, for he kept to the straightforward,\nmiddle-of-the-road approach of those acts once he became a \nrecording artist in his own right--not that there's anything \nwrong with that. \n\nA dependable hitmaker throughout the late '80s and early '90s, \nMarx scored with rockers (&quot;Don't Mean Nothing,&quot;-\n- &quot;Should've Known Better&quot;, and ballads (&quot;Right Here Waiting,&quot;\n&quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot; alike. \n\nGreatest Hits collects those songs as well as the lion's share \nof his high-end chart action--of which there was plenty, proving \nthat a devotion to craft sometimes pays off better than fickle \ninspiration.\n_____________________________\n\n 1.
