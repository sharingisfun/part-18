More than enough mercury to contaminate 2,500 city blocks.  Radioactive americium 241 from thousands of smoke detectors, and the highest levels of vanadium ever recorded.  Children in nearby schools have developed serious respiratory problems.  Half of those who cleaned Ground Zero have serious health problems.  Hundreds of firefighters can no longer work; and fourteen rescue dogs have died.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78d3038792d2464beefc96e798e51926c2e2347b","amp;dn":"Confronting+the+Evidence+%282005%29+DVD+RIP+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78d3038792d2464beefc96e798e51926c2e2347b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,211,3,135,146,210,70,75,238,252,150,231,152,229,25,38,194,226,52,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
