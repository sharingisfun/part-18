Faded And Gone\n11. St. Lucy's Eyes\n\nThere is a forlorn and melancholy vibe hanging over Micky Braun these days. Listening to Raise My Glass, the latest studio album from his Texas-based band, Micky &amp; The Motorcars,\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a early Springsteen vibe going on on the title track, which launches Raise My Glass. Minor key guitars, an accordion, a steady beat, and a vocal performance from Braun that will break your heart. The pain is real, or at least Braun makes it sound real.\n\nThat brokenhearted feeling continues on Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Thousand TearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that runs into Ã¢â‚¬Å“Any Longer Any More,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ two songs that are side-by-side but are not as distinctive as they could be. I did like Kris FarrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar solo on the latter track.\n\nFans of the Texas/Red Dirt sound will latch on to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Far From You.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And if you like the chilly roots-country of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Odessa Snow,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not alone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a keeper!\n\nBraunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal performance on slow-burning ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“How Far IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is workmanlike, but decent.\n\nThe song that hits the hardest, though, is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never Been Out West,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a bittersweet slice of country, complete with pedal steel and an interesting drum pattern from stickman Shane Vannerson.\n\nVannersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drums are mixed up front on the bold and rapid-fire Ã¢â‚¬Å“St. LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eyes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This song shows what MMC are truly capable of.\n\n&quot;This life I lead, it's not for the faint of heart,&quot; Micky Braun warns listeners. Rough out there on the road, methinks.\n\nGary Braun, rhythm guitarist for the Motorcars, takes lead vocals on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big Casino,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song he co-wrote with brother and Reckless Kelly frontman Willy Braun. In fact the song has a muscular Reckless Kelly feel to it. A beefy track, for sure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f890c9451e6fe39e0220009fb6c1b9c920fb1eb2","amp;dn":"Micky+and+The+Motorcars+-+Raise+My+Glass+%5B2011%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f890c9451e6fe39e0220009fb6c1b9c920fb1eb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,144,201,69,30,111,227,158,2,32,0,159,182,193,185,201,32,251,30,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
