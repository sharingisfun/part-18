It is home to the world's first planned cities, where every house had its own bathroom and toilet five thousand years ago.\n\nThe Ancient Indians have not only given us yoga, meditation and complementary medicines, but they have furthered our knowledge of science, maths -- and invented Chaturanga, which became the game of chess.\n\nAccording to Albert Einstein, they &quot;taught us how to count&quot;, as they invented the numbers 1-9 and 'zero', without which there would be no computers or digital age. Unfairly we call this system of counting Arabic numbers -- a misplaced credit.\n\nTwo thousand years ago the Indians pioneered plastic surgery, reconstructing the noses and ears on the faces of people who had been disfigured through punishment or warfare. They performed eye operations such as cataract removal and invented inoculation to protect their population from Smallpox, saving thousands of lives.\n\nHosted by Jack Turner.
