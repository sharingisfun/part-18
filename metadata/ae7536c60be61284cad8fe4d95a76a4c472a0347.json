There is also a moving moment in the video in which a girl mourns the loss of her dog.\n\nIn the beginning of the video, it shows a man taking a gun and his wife worried. In the end, the video shows his wife and his son waiting for him as he leaves the prison. What he did and his time in prison are shown in the video of the song &quot;Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot;.\n\n\n\nFile Name:\n11 Can't Stop Lovin' You - Van Halen\n\nFile Format:\nmp4\n\nDuration:\n00:04:06\n\nBit Rate:\n1702k\n\nFile Size:\n49.99 MB\n\nVideo Codec:\nh264\n\nVideo Bitrate:\n1572k\n\nVideo Size:\n720x528\n\nAspect Ratio:\n1.36:1\n\nFrame Rate:\n23.98fps\n\nAudio Codec:\nmp3\n\nAudio Bitrate:\n128k\n\nChannels:\n2\n\nSample Rate:\n48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae7536c60be61284cad8fe4d95a76a4c472a0347","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Can%27t+Stop+Lovin%27+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae7536c60be61284cad8fe4d95a76a4c472a0347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,117,54,198,11,230,18,132,202,216,254,77,149,167,106,76,71,42,3,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
