Navas argues that Remix, as a form of discourse,     :\n : affects culture in ways that go beyond the basic recombination of material.:\n : His investigation locates the roots of Remix in early forms of mechanical  :\n : reproduction, in seven stages, beginning in the nineteenth century with the:\n : development of the photo camera and the phonograph, leading to contemporary:\n : remix culture. This book places particular emphasis on the rise of Remix in:\n : music during the 1970s and '80s in relation to art and media at the        :\n : beginning of the twenty-first Century. Navas argues that Remix is a type of:\n : binder, a cultural glueÃ¢â‚¬â€a virusÃ¢â‚¬â€that informs and supports contemporary     :\n : culture.                                                                   :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46254446de4295fa94639597da829570f6e2cd29","amp;dn":"Springer+Remix+Theory+The+Aesthetics+of+Sampling+2012+Retail+eBo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46254446de4295fa94639597da829570f6e2cd29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,37,68,70,222,66,149,250,148,99,149,151,218,130,149,112,246,226,205,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
