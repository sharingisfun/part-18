Hands down, the best heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever seen.  Lord, does Grigorovich know how to Bring It.\n  \nFirst, the renovated Bolshoi Theater is incredibly beautiful.  The stage is easily the size of Staten Island.  \nTwenty-four flowers in Waltz of the Flowers looked like it could have been half of a cast.\n \nIn this production, GrigorovichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Drosselmeyer is a full-dancing principal character, today performed by Denis Savin.  \nHe was marvelous in the way that he segued from the character acting into extraordinary technique.  \nIt was all very seamless and kind of made you nervous about what this character might do next.  \nSpooky, charming, and one heck of a dancer. \n \nAfter the Christmas tree grows gigantic with flashing lights, it then changes into a stunning snow-covered tree \nand remains in the background for the rest of the ballet.\n \nThe entire company appeared stoked (with energy) for the performance.  \nThere really was only one mishap when Victoria Osipova as one of the Indian Dolls unintentionally sat down on the stage.  \nShe and her partner, Ruslan Pronin, seemed to be uncertain about each other from the start.  \nDaria Khokhlova and Vadim Kurochkin were the French Dolls who danced an inventive pas de trois with a cute rocking-lamb that \nthey pulled along on a pair of long ribbons.  \nThe Spanish Dolls, Anna Okuneva and Andrei Bolotin, delivered some outstanding pyro-technical stuff:  \nshe breezed through a combination of fouette, double fouette, tour en lÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢air with feet crossed, single pirouette from fifth.  \nTry it. \n \nThe mice in this production are an advanced strain that return during Act II to harass the principals.  \nPavel Dmitrichenko was an exceptionally menacing Mouse King.\n \nThe little children are portrayed by the smaller corps women with the little ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œboysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in convincing short wigs.  \nFritz was danced by Anna Proskurnina, who occasionally took a step or two in a way that was a dead giveaway that \nshe was really a ballerina.\n \nArtem Ovcharenko and Nina Kaptsova were The Nutcracker and Marie, respectively.  \nOutstanding and perfectly cast in every way.  Grigorovich likes to employ that step where the male principal \ntour jetes and then passe developpes to the back ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with good reason ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spectacular when the dancer keeps \nthe energy flowing backward as he executes it.  Ovcharenko caught the step beautifully today.  \nHis legs are extraordinarily long, his feet acutely arched, and he caught the balance on the developpe like \na surfer catching a big wave.  Kaptsova gave a nearly flawless technical performance.  \nThe cameras did not provide many close-ups of her face, so it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t easy to see what was going on there.  \nBut her movement was sublime.  Haglund was disappointed with Kaptsova in a Spartacus DVD he once saw because \nshe didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t measure up to Bessmertnova.  But today, she was pitch perfect as Marie.\n\nThe classic corps in the Snow and Flowers scenes were exquisite.  \nThe cameras gave us a few glimpses of the stage from approximately the first or second balcony \nand the formations were just stunningly beautiful. \n \nGrigorovichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s PdD for the Nutcracker and Marie includes the same huge Bolshoi lift that \nwe will see in the upcoming ABT Nutcracker.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly wonderful if Ratmansky wants to include it as a tribute \nto the great, great Grigorovich, and the audience will appreciate that.  \nAfter all, we hardly ever get to see these spectacular lifts.  \n However, the lift, as we saw today, is done by the Bolshoi in ONE piece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not pause, get set for five minutes, and then hoist the ballerina up as was done by two sets of ABT principals in last WednesdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rehearsal.  If weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to honor Grigorovich by including his lift in our new Nutcracker, letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s do it right, Folks.  In ONE piece, People.  Mukhamedov could have done it with one hand.\n \nThe Bolshoi Orchestra wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t about to be outshone by the extraordinary dancers on the stage.  \nThe music was magnificent, rich, and evenly miked so that we heard everything.  \nWe had, in fact, a seat so good that you couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have bought it in the theater.  What a treat!\n \nHaglund must bestow upon the Bolshoi and Yuri Grigorovich this \nWaltz of the Flowers First Position Pump Bump Award for a splendid Nutcracker performance today\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.78:1 \nRun Time: 1:54 \nchapters: NONE\nresolution: 640x368\nVideo Codec: AVC/h.264\nAudio Codec: AAC \nEncoder handbrake: 0.9.5\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1a0924935d8bd219bc84efc2df147aec29be72","amp;dn":"The+nutcracker-Bolshoi+ballet-2010%5BiPod+H264+TSrip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1a0924935d8bd219bc84efc2df147aec29be72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,26,9,36,147,93,139,210,25,188,132,239,194,223,20,122,236,41,190,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
