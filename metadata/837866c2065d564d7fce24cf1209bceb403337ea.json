The film features an additional cast of Luke Wilson, Dave Chappelle, William Forsythe, Nicole Ari Parker, and others.\n\nThe film was released in September 1999 and opened as the number one movie in North America. It went on to gross over US$60 million at the box office and was considered a great success because it nearly doubled its production costs. A sequel was in the works but never materialized and has since been dropped from plans at Columbia Pictures.\n\n\nTHIS IS A DVD RIP\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:837866c2065d564d7fce24cf1209bceb403337ea","amp;dn":"Blue+Streak%28DVD%29.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"837866c2065d564d7fce24cf1209bceb403337ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,120,102,194,6,93,86,77,127,206,36,207,18,9,188,235,64,51,55,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
