In this cyberpunk adventure inspired by Blade Runner and Neuromancer, you are free to choose your playstyle: will you be a silent assassin, a hacker, a diplomat or a straightforward gunfighter?\r\n\r\nDesigned as a throwback to earlier 2D platforming and action games combined with modern RPG elements, Dex offers real-time combat, a mature storyline and interactive dialogues.\r\n\r\nCustomize your characterâ€™s skills, equipment and even augmentations â€“ implants which grant you superhuman abilities and open up new paths within the gameâ€™s open world.\r\n\r\nA revolutionary hacking mechanic also lets you dive into Cyberspace: overcome viruses and intrusion countermeasures to deactivate turrets, overload devices, steal corporate data and cripple your enemies!\r\n\r\nRare blend of realism and creative vision: Realistic action, mature storyline, and complex character interactions combined with hand-drawn characters, animations, and environments, arcade-style melee combat, and an original conception of cyberspace.\r\nMultiple paths: Operate in physical reality or in Cyberspace.

Improve your character and gear to unlock gameplay-changing upgrades that reinforce and customize your gameplay style.\r\nUnique hacking mechanic: Transfer your consciousness to your avatar, overcome intrusion countermeasures, take action, and then return back to your body in a fraction of a real-time second to see the results â€“ deactivated turrets, overloaded devices, enemies with crippled implantsâ€¦\r\nNeo-cyberpunk: Story deeply inspired by the cyberpunk novels of William Gibson and other classical cyberpunk authors, flavored with a contemporary concept of augmented reality.\r\nRich game world and diverse level design: Visit diverse locations in Harbor Prime, a futuristic city complete with luxurious skyscrapers, run-down shantytowns, and seedy red-light districts. Take part in street brawls, steal corporate data, overcome environmental hazards, and, of course, stay alive â€“ no easy task.\r\nThree special outfits: The Samio Cyberwear allows you to regenerate your Focus when hacking, the Euroforce BattleRig offers physical protection against bullets, and the Armagear InvisiSuit can make you invisible!
