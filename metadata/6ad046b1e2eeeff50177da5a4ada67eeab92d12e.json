Witmark &amp; Sons, from 1962 to 1964. The album, released on October 19, 2010, is the latest addition in the series of official &quot;bootleg&quot; recordings issued by Columbia Records.[1]\n\nThe album features 47 tracks with Dylan accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, harmonica and occasionally piano. The recordings were only available as bootlegs until the 1991 release of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1991, which included three of the demos.[2] A fourth demo, a version of &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot;, was included on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack, which came out in 2005. The remaining tracks on The Witmark Demos were officially released for the first time in 2010. While Dylan recorded subsequent versions of most of the songs, the album features 15 that were produced exclusively as demos and had never been heard before except as bootlegs.\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Man on the Street&quot; (Fragment) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:07\n2.\t&quot;Hard Times in New York Town&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:57\n3.\t&quot;Poor Boy Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n4.\t&quot;Ballad for a Friend&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:23\n5.\t&quot;Rambling, Gambling Willie&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n6.\t&quot;Talking Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:42\n7.\t&quot;Standing on the Highway&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:32\n8.\t&quot;Man on the Street&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:30\n9.\t&quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:38\n10.\t&quot;Long Ago, Far Away&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:29\n11.\t&quot;A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:49\n12.\t&quot;Tomorrow Is a Long Time&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:46\n13.\t&quot;The Death of Emmett Till&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:32\n14.\t&quot;Let Me Die in My Footsteps&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:37\n15.\t&quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n16.\t&quot;Quit Your Low Down Ways&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:50\n17.\t&quot;Baby, I'm in the Mood for You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:36\n18.\t&quot;Bound to Lose, Bound to Win&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:19\n19.\t&quot;All Over You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:52\n20.\t&quot;I'd Hate to Be You on That Dreadful Day&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:00\n21.\t&quot;Long Time Gone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:46\n22.\t&quot;Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:17\n23.\t&quot;Masters of War&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:23\n24.\t&quot;Oxford Town&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:33\n25.\t&quot;Farewell&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38 previously issued in part on The Bootleg Series Volume VII\n2.\t&quot;Walkin' Down the Line&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23 previously issued on The Bootleg Series Volume I\n3.\t&quot;I Shall Be Free&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:30\n4.\t&quot;Bob Dylan's Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:58\n5.\t&quot;Bob Dylan's Dream&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n6.\t&quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:49\n7.\t&quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n8.\t&quot;Seven Curses&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n9.\t&quot;Hero Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:36\n10.\t&quot;Whatcha Gonna Do?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n11.\t&quot;Gypsy Lou&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:45\n12.\t&quot;Ain't Gonna Grieve&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:28\n13.\t&quot;John Brown&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19\n14.\t&quot;Only a Hobo&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:25\n15.\t&quot;When the Ship Comes In&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:56 previously issued on The Bootleg Series Volume I\n16.\t&quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03 previously issued on The Bootleg Series Volume I\n17.\t&quot;Paths of Victory&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:11\n18.\t&quot;Guess I'm Doing Fine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n19.\t&quot;Baby, Let Me Follow You Down&quot; (Eric Von Schmidt, Reverend Gary Davis, Dave Van Ronk) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:56\n20.\t&quot;Mama, You Been on My Mind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:14\n21.\t&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:55\n22.\t&quot;I'll Keep It with Mine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ad046b1e2eeeff50177da5a4ada67eeab92d12e","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Witmark+Demos+1962+-+1964+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ad046b1e2eeeff50177da5a4ada67eeab92d12e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,208,70,177,226,238,239,245,1,119,218,90,74,218,103,238,171,146,209,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
