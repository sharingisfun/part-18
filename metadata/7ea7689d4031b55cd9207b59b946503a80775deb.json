Behind every dropout factory, we discover, lurks a powerful, \n\nentrenched, and self-serving cartel.\n\nTeachers punished for speaking out. Principals fired for trying to do the \n\nright thing. Union leaders defending the indefensible. Bureaucrats \n\nblocking new charter schools. These are just some of the people we meet \n\nin The Cartel. The film also introduces us to teens who can't read, \n\nparents desperate for change, and teachers struggling to launch stable \n\nalternative schools for inner city kids who want to learn. We witness the \n\ntears of a little girl denied a coveted charter school spot, and we share \n\nthe triumph of a Camden homeschool's first graduating class. \n\n\n=========================================================================\n\n================\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea7689d4031b55cd9207b59b946503a80775deb","amp;dn":"The+Cartel+%282009%29+Education+%2B+Politics+%3D+%24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea7689d4031b55cd9207b59b946503a80775deb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,167,104,157,64,49,181,92,217,32,123,89,185,70,80,58,128,119,93,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
