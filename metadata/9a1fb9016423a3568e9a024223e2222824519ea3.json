The band blended elements of folk and rock with distinctive three part harmonies. Their best known hits include &quot;A Horse with No Name,&quot; &quot;Sister Golden Hair,&quot; &quot;Ventura Highway,&quot; &quot;Tin Man,&quot; &quot;Daisy Jane,&quot; and &quot;Lonely People&quot;. The band won a 1972 Grammy for Best New Artist following the release of their second album, Homecoming, and was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. This definitive collection includes the following albums: America, Homecoming, Hat Trick, Holiday, Hearts, Hideaway, and Harbor. This Hi-Res collection is not to be missed!\n\n  \nAmerica - America #1971/2013#\n FLAC #tracks# 24 bit/192 kHz | Time - 46:28 minutes | 1,68 GB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: HDTracks.com | Front cover\n\n America's debut album is a folk-pop classic, a stellar collection of memorable songs that would prove influential on such acts as the Eagles and Dan Fogelberg. Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash are the group's obvious stylistic touchstone here, especially in the vocal harmonies used #compare the thick chordal singing of &quot;Sandman&quot; and &quot;Children&quot; to CS&amp;N's &quot;You Don't Have to Cry&quot; and &quot;Guinevere&quot;# and the prominent use of active strummed acoustic guitar arrangements #contrast &quot;Riverside&quot; to CS&amp;N's &quot;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes&quot;#. America's intricate interplay of acoustic guitar textures is more ambitious than that of their influences, however. Performance quality is usually good, though on occasion sloppily executed or out of tune #especially on the openings to &quot;Donkey Jaw&quot; and &quot;I Never Found the Time&quot;#. Lengthy instrumental introductions #&quot;Donkey Jaw&quot;#, middle improvisatory interludes #&quot;Here&quot;#, and closings #&quot;Clarice&quot;# are frequently encountered. Most of these selections boast highly unusual and inventive chord progressions that work well without drawing undue attention to themselves. Lyrics are sometimes trite #&quot;I need you/Like the flower needs the rain&quot;# or obscure #&quot;He flies the sky/Like an eagle in the eye/Of a hurricane that's abandoned&quot;#, but the music more than makes up for any verse problems; only the odd &quot;Pigeon Song&quot; seems an unsalvageable misstep. Sound quality here has a covered, intimate feel that lends a ghostly aura to this release. Chart hits from this album include the spectrally loping &quot;A Horse with No Name,&quot; the squarishly tuneful &quot;I Need You,&quot; and the nervously dour &quot;Sandman.&quot; Other highlights include the buoyantly charming &quot;Three Roses,&quot; the yearningly lovely &quot;Rainy Day,&quot; and the quietly ringing &quot;Clarice.&quot; In spite of its flaws, this platter is very highly recommended.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Riverside\n 02 - Sandman\n 03 - Three Roses\n 04 - Children\n 05 - A Horse With No Name\n 06 - Here\n 07 - I Need You\n 08 - Rainy Day\n 09 - Never Found The Time\n 10 - Clarice\n 11 - Donkey Jaw\n 12 - Pigeon Song\n\n\n\nAmerica - Homecoming #1972/2013#\n FLAC #tracks# 24 bit/192 kHz | Time - 33:27 minutes | 1,09 GB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: HDTracks.com | Front cover\n\n Homecoming, America's finest album, refines and focuses the folk-pop approach found on their debut release. The songs here are tighter and more forthright, with fewer extended solo instrumental sections than before. The sound quality is clear and bright; the colorful arrangements, while still acoustic guitar-based, feature more electric guitar and keyboards. The performance quality is more assured, among the most urgently committed the group would ever put on vinyl. Verses are still sometimes banal and clunky #&quot;You can't disregard your friends/But life gets so hard when you reach the end&quot;# or cryptic #&quot;Sorry, boy, but I've been hit by purple rain&quot;#, but a number of the song subjects here exhibit a yearning sense of wanderlust and love of the outdoors that proves to be highly evocative and compelling #particularly on &quot;Moon Song,&quot; &quot;Ventura Highway,&quot; &quot;California Revisited,&quot; and &quot;Cornwall Blank&quot;#. Chordal progressions are sophisticated and contain many subtle surprises. A few new style wrinkles can be seen in the country-influenced &quot;Don't Cross the River,&quot; the drivingly gutsy &quot;California Revisited&quot; #perhaps the hardest-rocking song the group would ever produce#, and the hushed yet mildly funky &quot;Head &amp; Heart.&quot; Chart hits from this release include &quot;Ventura Highway,&quot; &quot;Only in Your Heart,&quot; and &quot;Don't Cross the River,&quot; but each song here has something to recommend it. This top-flight album is a very rewarding listen.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Ventura Highway\n 02 - To Each His Own\n 03 - Don't Cross The River\n 04 - Moon Song\n 05 - Only In Your Heart\n 06 - Till The Sun Comes Up Again\n 07 - Cornwall Blank\n 08 - Head And Heart\n 09 - California Revisited\n 10 - Saturn Nights\n\n\n\n\nAmerica - Hat Trick #1973/2013#\n FLAC #tracks# 24 bit/192 kHz | Time - 42:00 minutes | 1,54 GB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: HDTracks.com | Front cover\n\n America's Hat Trick has the distinction of being the album that contained the first song that the band sang that wasn't theirs. Written by Willis Ramsey, the syrupy &quot;Muskrat Love&quot; only went as high as number 67 on the singles chart for America, but the Captain &amp; Tennille managed to take it all the way to number four only three years later. The rest of Hat Trick failed to garner any hits and is a slight disappointment after the success of their self-titled debut in 1972, which harbored the band's first number one hit in &quot;A Horse With No Name,&quot; and after Homecoming, their satisfying follow-up. Hat Trick peaked at number 28 on the album charts, faltering mainly because the songs lacked the cordial folk-rock melodies and mindful songwriting that prevailed on the earlier releases. &quot;She's Gonna Let You Down&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Song&quot; are the album's best cuts, but banal offerings such as &quot;Green Monkey,&quot; &quot;Willow Tree Lullaby,&quot; and &quot;Molten Love&quot; have Bunnell and Peek straying off course, sounding stale and musically feeble. The unsuccessful repercussions that evolved from Hat Trick both commercially and otherwise were not overlooked by the band, and they rebounded with 1974's Holiday, an album which yielded hits in &quot;Tin Man&quot; and &quot;Lonely People,&quot; which both made Billboard's Top Five.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Muskrat Love\n 02 - Wind Wave\n 03 - She's Gonna Let You Down\n 04 - Rainbow Song\n 05 - Submarine Ladies\n 06 - It's Life\n 07 - Hat Trick\n 08 - Molten Love\n 09 - Green Monkey\n 10 - Willow Tree Lullaby\n 11 - Goodbye\n\n\n\nAmerica - Holiday #1974/2013#\n FLAC #tracks# 24 bit/192 kHz | Time - 33:40 minutes | 1,22 GB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: HDTracks.com | Front cover\n\n America fully recovered from Hat Trick's dismal results with 1974's Holiday, with producer George Martin's influence rubbing off on both of the album's Top Five singles. With &quot;Tin Man&quot;'s wonderfully polished soft pop ease and the wispiness of &quot;Lonely People,&quot; the band was able to recapture the same formula that put early hits like &quot;A Horse with No Name,&quot; &quot;I Need You,&quot; and &quot;Ventura Highway&quot; in the Top Ten. The difference with &quot;Holiday&quot; is that their light and breezy melodies and attractive folk-rock sound filtered through more than just the two hit tracks on the album. &quot;Another Try,&quot; &quot;Old Man Took,&quot; &quot;In the Country,&quot; and even the clichÃƒÂ©-sounding &quot;Baby It's Up to You&quot; contain a sturdy enough mixture of guitar and harmony to rise them above inessential filler, at least as far as America's material is concerned. Cuts like &quot;Mad Dog&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot; suffer somewhat from trite lyrics and a seemingly hurried compositional formula, but this album as a whole ascertained that the group was definitely showing their true potential once more. The album that followed Holiday, 1975's Hearts, showed even stronger improvement, taking the overly catchy &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; to number one and scoring a Top 20 hit with the Sunday morning frailty of &quot;Daisy Jane&quot;.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Miniature #Instrumental#\n 02 - Tin Man\n 03 - Another Try\n 04 - Lonely People\n 05 - Glad To See You\n 06 - Mad Dog\n 07 - Hollywood\n 08 - Baby It's Up To You\n 09 - You\n 10 - Old Man Took\n 11 - What Does It Matter\n 12 - In The Country\n\n\nAmerica - Hearts #1975/2013#\n FLAC #tracks# 24 bit/192 kHz | Time - 37:00 minutes | 1,4 GB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: HDTracks.com | Front cover\n\n Hearts is the fifth original studio album by American folk rock trio America, released by Warner Bros.
