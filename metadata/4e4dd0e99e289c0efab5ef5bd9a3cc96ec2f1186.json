Together with Jack Bruce he is responsible for a characteristic bass playing - an important component for the sound of Cream and Mountain. Less known are Felix' solo works - and nowadays they are really hard to find... In his cooperation with Japanese Blues-Rock group Creation you find typical Pappalardi compositions, reminding at some Mountain classics. The sound of the live album is not the best, could be an audience recording, maybe a liberated bootleg. I can't read Japanese, maybe one of you downloaders is able to translate the liner notes. The last album Don't Worry Ma is better known - some nice covers played from high class session musicians.\n\n\nFelix Pappalardi, Creation - Felix Pappalardi And Creation\nLabel: A&amp;M Records - SP 4586, A&amp;M Records - SP-4586\nFormat: Vinyl, LP, Album\nCountry: US\nReleased: 1976\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Blues Rock, Prog Rock\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1 \tShe's Got Me \t3:50\nA2 \tDreams I Dream Of You \t4:05\nA3 \tGreen Rocky Road \t3:52\nA4 \tPreachers' Daughter \t2:52\nA5 \tListen To The Music \t3:35\nB1 \tSecret Power \t4:44\nB2 \tSummer Days \t4:36\nB3 \tDark Eyed Lady Of The Night \t4:22\nB4 \tBallad Of A Sad Cafe \t3:22\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nFelix Pappalardi - vocals, bass, keyboards, vibraphone, production\nKazuo &quot;Flash&quot; Takeda - lead guitar\nYoshiaki &quot;Daybreak&quot; Iijima - rhythm guitar\nShigeru &quot;Sugar&quot; Matsumoto - bass\nMasayuki &quot;Thunder&quot; Higuchi - drums\n\nPaul Butterfield - harmonica on track A1\nRalph Moss - percussion on track A5\n\n\n\n\nCreation with Felix Pappalardi - Live At Budokan 1976\nLabel: Universal Music / Hagakure Records - UPCH-20043~44\nFormat: 2 x CD, Album, Mono\nCountry: Japan\nReleased: 2007\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Blues Rock, Hard Rock\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1:\n01.
