To help them define their current musical and cultural standpoint the band recruited Brazil-based Scottish musician Paul Mounsey, whose contemporary grooves on Proterra sharpen but ultimately fail to modernise Runrig's stadium-Celt-rock oevre, based on unquestionable sincerity and decent musicianship though it is.\n\nAs ever, vast keyboard swathes swill around with assorted strings and peripatetic skirly pipes while drums and percussion pound the relentless anthem beat with occasional borrowings from elsewhere. Thus are illustrated songs of legend, aspiration and regret whose lyrical structures echo the bardic forms of old but lack the sparkle of true Lit: sun-soaked seas, crystal-clear fountains and phrases like &quot;...we rise/soul kites in a diamond sky&quot; trip the clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© meter on a regular basis. \n\nThe Gaelic material has always been Runrig's strength - here, An Toll Dubh (The Dungeon) evokes a genuine thrill of Celtic otherworldliness but it's an all-too-brief respite in a sea of overstated reverberama for the lighter-waving masses. Angels From The Ashes, a soothing but unmemorable piano instrumental, winds up a 'project' album which will be bought in cartloads by the band's huge international fanbase and unregenerated prog-rock fans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95aea3b55c00d4b416fc098d2e64c48e72d58bb7","amp;dn":"Runrig...Proterra%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95aea3b55c00d4b416fc098d2e64c48e72d58bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,174,163,181,92,0,212,180,22,252,9,141,46,100,196,142,114,213,139,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
