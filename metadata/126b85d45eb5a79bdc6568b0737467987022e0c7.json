In this course, Joseph Lowery tackles Dreamweaver CC 2015, built with both coding and design in mind. To start, Joe reviews Dreamweaver's revamped approach to responsive design, which includes integration with Bootstrap and new multi-device preview. Coding also gets a turbo boost from Emmet, and both sides benefit from the new and improved Live view workflow, CSS Designer, and DOM panel. The course also covers a variety of other improvements, such as the updates to the Extract and Snippets panels.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Check back often for updates. New chapters will be added each time Adobe releases a major Dreamweaver CC update.\n\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:126b85d45eb5a79bdc6568b0737467987022e0c7","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Dreamweaver%3A+2015+Creative+Cloud+Updates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"126b85d45eb5a79bdc6568b0737467987022e0c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,107,133,212,94,181,167,155,220,101,104,176,115,116,103,152,112,34,224,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
