It may be unfair to compare them to the Grateful Dead, but the Doctors often suggest a lighter, more pop-oriented version of that band. While all of the best tracks were issued as singles (\\&quot;Jimmy Olsen\\'s Blues,\\&quot; \\&quot;Two Princes,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Little Miss\\&quot;), there are still enough good moments on the rest of the album to please anyone who loves the hits. \n \n \n Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic, \n HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality \n of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is! \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Jimmy olsen\\'s blues [04:39] \n 02.What time is it [04:51] \n 03.Little miss can\\'t be wrong [03:55] \n 04.Forty or fifty [04:24] \n 05.Refrigerator car [04:46] \n 06.More than she knows [02:12] \n 07.Two princes [04:18] \n 08.Off my line [03:59] \n 09.How could you. want him [04:59] \n (when you know you could hav \n 10.Shinbone alley,hard to [12:43] \n exist \n ____ \n \n 50:46 min \n 75,4 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10aafdb93172fb800fe23e5776e26ab65bee6cf0","amp;dn":"Spin_Doctors-Pocket_Full_Of_Kryptonite-%28Retail%29-1991-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10aafdb93172fb800fe23e5776e26ab65bee6cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,170,253,185,49,114,251,128,15,226,62,87,118,226,106,182,91,238,108,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
