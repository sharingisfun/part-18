The two countries are compared with respect to issues concerning trade and development, the World Trade Organization, international dispute settlement, regional/free trade agreements, outsourcing, international investment, foreign investment, corporate governance, competition law and policy, and law and development in general.\n\nThe findings demonstrate that, though their domestic approaches to economic issues diverge, China and India adopt similar stances at the international level on many major issues, recapturing images which existed during the immediate post-colonial era. Cooperation between China and India could provide leadership in the struggle for economic development in developing countries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49eee931f74263e6fecf4d2f83d8efd456fb1d20","amp;dn":"China%2C+India+and+the+International+Economic+Order","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49eee931f74263e6fecf4d2f83d8efd456fb1d20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,238,233,49,247,66,99,230,254,207,77,47,131,216,239,212,86,251,29,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
