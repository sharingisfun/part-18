The problem is that an overhydrated athlete is at a performance disadvantage and at risk of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH)--a potentially fatal condition.\n\nDr. Tim Noakes takes you inside the science of athlete hydration for a fascinating look at the human bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s need for water and how it uses the liquids it ingests. He also chronicles the shaky research that reported findings contrary to results in nearly all of NoakesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ extensive and since-confirmed studies.\n\nIn Waterlogged, Noakes sets the record straight, exposing the myths surrounding dehydration and presenting up-to-date hydration guidelines for endurance sport and prolonged training activities. Enough with oversold sports drinks and obsessing over water consumption before, during, and after every workout, he says. Time for the factsÃ¢â‚¬â€and the prevention of any more needless fatalities.
