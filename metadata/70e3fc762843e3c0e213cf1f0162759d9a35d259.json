I have a personal friend who worked on this project, and the movies are hard to find on the internet and rarely get rerun, so I want to make sure people can see these engaging documentaries.\n\n\n\nFrom ESPN's 30 for 30 official site for The Band That Wouldn't Die:\n\nIn late March of 1984, a moving company secretly packed up the Baltimore ColtsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ belongings and its fleet of vans snuck off in the darkness of the early morning. Leaving a city of deeply devoted fans in shock and disbelief. What caused owner Robert Irsay to turn his back on a town that was as closely linked to its team as any in the NFL? Academy Award-winning filmmaker Barry Levinson, himself a long-standing Baltimore Colts fanatic, will probe that question in light of the changing relationship of sports to community. Through the eyes of members of the Colts Marching Band, Levinson will illustrate how a fan base copes with losing the team that it loves.\n\n\nAbout 30 for 30:\n\n[30 for 30] is an unprecedented documentary series featuring thirty films from some of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest storytellers. Each filmmaker will bring their passion and personal point of view to their film detailing the issues, trends, athletes, teams, rivalries, games and events that transformed the sports landscape from 1979 to 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e3fc762843e3c0e213cf1f0162759d9a35d259","amp;dn":"ESPN+-+30+for+30%3A+The+Band+That+Wouldn%5C%27t+Die+%28HD+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e3fc762843e3c0e213cf1f0162759d9a35d259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,227,252,118,40,67,227,192,226,19,207,31,1,98,117,157,154,53,210,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
