YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to write algorithms that automatically sort and redirect email based on statistical patterns. Authors Drew Conway and John Myles White approach the process in a practical fashion, using a case-study driven approach rather than a traditional math-heavy presentation.\n\nThis book also includes a short tutorial on using the popular R language to manipulate and analyze data. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get clear examples for analyzing sample data and writing machine learning programs with R.\nMine email content with R functions, using a collection of sample files\nAnalyze the data and use the results to write a Bayesian spam classifier\nRank email by importance, using factors such as thread activity\nUse your email ranking analysis to write a priority inbox program\nTest your classifier and priority inbox with a separate email sample set\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2cd270ad6c86ee61447a5c40aa2692fa3c4fdc","amp;dn":"Machine+Learning+for+Email+Spam+Filtering+and+Priority+Inbox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2cd270ad6c86ee61447a5c40aa2692fa3c4fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,44,210,112,173,108,134,238,97,68,122,92,64,170,38,146,250,60,79,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
