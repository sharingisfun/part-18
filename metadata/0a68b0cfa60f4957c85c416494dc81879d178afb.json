The Battle for Britain's Past \r\nSeries charting the movement to protect the heritage of the country, from its birth in the 19th century to the modern day. English Heritage cares for over 400 historic buildings, monuments and sites - from world-famous prehistoric sites to grand medieval castles, from Roman forts on the edges of the empire to a Cold War bunker. Through these, we bring the story of England to life for over 10 million people each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  From Old Bones to Precious Stones \r\nCharting the birth of the heritage movement and the first arguments of radical thought, from figures including John Lubbock MP, Lieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers, Charles Darwin and John Ruskin. These remarkable individuals asked important questions and came up with the building blocks of a new world that valued the past. Their actions led to the first piece of legislation to safeguard prehistoric and ancient structures which until then had often fallen prey to the short-term interests of farmers and landowners.\r\n\r\n2)  The Men from the Ministry \r\nThe second episode reveals the unsung heroes of the heritage movement, the clever civil servants who saved the great ruins of Britain. It explores the determination of Charles Reed Peers from the Office of Works, who seized the chance in the interwar years to make history a popular cause, and looks at how the increasingly mobile British public began to embrace the idea of a day out at an historic site. As the country houses faced a crisis with owners demolishing or abandoning their homes, who would come to the rescue - the Ministry of Works or the National Trust?\r\n\r\n3)  Broken Propylaeums \r\nThe final episode follows the changing fortunes of a heritage movement floored by the after-effects of World War II and looks at how people like Sir John Betjeman and Dan Cruickshank gave families access to heritage and architecture on television from the comfort of their living rooms. It looks at the preservation of sometimes ugly, certainly unpleasant parts of our built past such as workhouses and underground mineshafts, and contemplates what the future may hold for heritage in Britain - a nation faced with economic uncertainty, depleting resources and increasing challenges of sustainability.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/83/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/76/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8c/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/58/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/86/Heritage-the-Battle-for-Britain-s-Past-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3040 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.33 GB\r\n * Source: WEBRip\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p014fxzv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a68b0cfa60f4957c85c416494dc81879d178afb","amp;dn":"BBC+Heritage+The+Battle+for+Britains+Past+2of3+The+Men+from+the+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a68b0cfa60f4957c85c416494dc81879d178afb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,104,176,207,166,15,73,87,200,92,65,100,148,220,129,135,157,23,138,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
