More natural -\nless stylised - than the others. This production\nflows along quite nicely.\n\nSuperficially a comedy of manners, a party host's\nspouse has gone missing, guests are arriving and\nappearances have to be maintained. The uninvited\nguest, a psychiatrist, arrives, sets things to\nrights, and the host's mistress moves on.\n\nThe deeper theme is that, having made commitments,\nwe should make the best of things. Which seems to\nme to be Eliot's conscience playing up about his\ntroubled first marriage. Here matters are resolved.\nIn life his wife died in the lunatic asylum to\nwhich he'd had her committed.\n\nCast\nJeremy Child\nIan McDermott\nDiane Quick\nSheila Gish\nMalcolm Sinclair\nEmily Brune\nBenedict Cumberbatch\nRachel Atkins\nPhilip Vox\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cdca2f86b5d34f67dcf35780485c65664375ff2","amp;dn":"BBC+WS+-+T+S+Eliot%5C%27s+%5C%27The+Cocktail+Party%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cdca2f86b5d34f67dcf35780485c65664375ff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,220,162,248,107,93,52,246,125,207,53,120,4,133,198,86,100,55,95,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
