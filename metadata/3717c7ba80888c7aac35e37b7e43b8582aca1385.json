Amen?\n\nAs with the past two years of gathering together music for all of you to sample, it's my continued prayer that you will turn to your Bible for God's Word, and only tune into this music supplementary to that.  I also pray that you share this music with your family and friends, support those Artists whom songs find a regular home within your collection, continue to seed for perhaps a little longer than you might normally would, and above all else, give the glory to God where it rightfully and righteously belongs.\n\nThat being said, let's start 2013 right.  There are 26 titles being shared today.  Grab it all if you want to, but if you're genre specific, and looking for Pop, we have Adam Gilley and Capital Kings. If you're looking for some Praise And Worship we have Andy Park, Bluetree, Hillsong United, Hymns Collective, and Planetshakers to choose from. How about Contemporary?  Chris Tomlin, Jason Castro, and Kim Walker. There's a lot of Hip-Hop / Rap being shared today including CJ Luckey, Crossover, Forgiven, Je'kob, Ruslan, Skrip, and SOC. Are you looking for some Christian Hardcore? How about Defy Tolerance, and Overcome. Techno we have DJ Cmd. Rock we have Elizabeth South, Twenty One Pilots, and Vota in this bundle. Singer / Songwriter we have Ryan Delmore. And for Gospel there's The Tri-City Singers.\n\nSpecifically, this 1st bundle includes the following 26 releases...\n\n * Adam Gilley - 2013 - Audio Aftermath\n * Andy Park - 2013 - A Taste Of Heaven\n * Bluetree - 2013 - Live - Mission Edition\n * Capital Kings - 2013 - Capital Kings\n * Chris Tomlin - 2013 - Burning Lights\n * CJ Luckey - 2013 - The Transition\n * Crossover - 2013 - Diamond Life EP\n * Defy Tolerance - 2013 - Stop The Bleeding\n * DJ Cmd - 2013 - Dance 64 - Achieving The Promise\n * Elizabeth South - 2013 - Superstar - Single\n * Forgiven - 2013 - One Day At A Time\n * Hillsong United - 2013 - Top Five\n * Hymns Collective - 2013 - Session One\n * Jason Castro - 2013 - Only A Mountain - Deluxe Edition\n * Je'kob - 2013 - Faith Hope Love - Eutopian Mixes\n * Kim Walker - 2013 - Still Believe\n * Overcome - 2013 - No Reserves.
