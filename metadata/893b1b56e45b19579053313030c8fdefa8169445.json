It is a great surprise for most to learn that some troubadours were women; their existence, and the songs they wrote, raise new questions not only about medieval culture but about women in history.\r\nThe women troubadours flourished in Provence (Southern France) between about 1150 and 1250 - the great period of troubadour poetry.
