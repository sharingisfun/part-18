So Brian takes Dara on a crash course of the skies, showing him how to spot and take pictures of celestial marvels. Plus, Brian finds time to talk to three astronauts currently floating around the International Space Station.\n\nSpecial guest Jonathan Ross finds out that anyone can be an astronomer, as heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s taught Astronomy 101 by The One ShowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resident stargazer, Mark Thompson. Over three days, gadget-obsessed Jonathan has to prove that he can navigate the night skies with just a pencil, paper and a humble pair of binoculars.\n\nFrom their base at the world-famous Lovell Telescope at the University of Manchester (one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest telescopes), Dara and Brian take viewers on a whistle-stop tour across the galaxy as they identify three of JanuaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unusual astronomical events ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a partial solar eclipse, the Quadrantids Meteor Shower and Jupiter aligning with Uranus.\n\nAs well as coaching Jonathan through the basics of astronomy, Mark is on hand to offer viewers at home tips on how to navigate their own way across the skies. And Liz Bonnin looks up at the clear skies of Hawaii to explain how the stars affect people even during the daytime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ba5f710df3e830d73af4b23e44b9433fc38752a","amp;dn":"Stargazing+Live+++%28BBC+2011+-+Complete+Astronomy+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ba5f710df3e830d73af4b23e44b9433fc38752a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,165,247,16,223,62,131,13,115,175,75,35,228,75,148,51,252,56,117,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
