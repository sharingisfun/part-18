Lee (Wiley-VCH, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-527-33213-7\r\n\r\nReactive, but not a reactant. Heterogeneous catalysts play an unseen role in many of today's processes and products. With the increasing emphasis on sustainability in both products and processes, this handbook is the first to combine the hot topics of heterogeneous catalysis and clean technology.\r\n\r\nIt focuses on the development of heterogeneous catalysts for use in clean chemical synthesis, dealing with how modern spectroscopic techniques can aid the design of catalysts for use in liquid phase reactions, their application in industrially important chemistries - including selective oxidation, hydrogenation, solid acid- and base-catalyzed processes - as well as the role of process intensification and use of renewable resources in improving the sustainability of chemical processes.\r\n\r\nWith its emphasis on applications, this book is of high interest to those working in the industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ae43ac77a7f090cbda0b356026a5525879ecb7","amp;dn":"Heterogeneous+Catalysts+for+Clean+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ae43ac77a7f090cbda0b356026a5525879ecb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,174,67,172,119,167,240,144,203,218,11,53,96,38,165,82,88,121,236,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
