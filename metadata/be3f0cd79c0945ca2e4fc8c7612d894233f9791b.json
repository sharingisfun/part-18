JenniferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love of reading began when she was a small child, and only continued to grow as she entered adulthood. Ever since winning a writing contest at the young age of nine, when she wrote a book about a girl with a pet unicorn, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreamed of writing a book of her own. \n\nQuickly learning that dreams donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just fall into your lap, she knew she had to chase them herself and not be afraid to dream a little bigger. Most importantly, she is a wife and mother, and is very lucky to have a family that loves and supports her in all things. She also has an unhealthy addiction to handbags and chocolate covered strawberries, neither of which she cares to change.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3f0cd79c0945ca2e4fc8c7612d894233f9791b","amp;dn":"Pretty+Little+Lies+Series+%281-2%29+by+Jennifer+Miller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3f0cd79c0945ca2e4fc8c7612d894233f9791b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,63,12,215,156,9,69,202,46,79,200,199,97,45,137,66,51,249,121,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
