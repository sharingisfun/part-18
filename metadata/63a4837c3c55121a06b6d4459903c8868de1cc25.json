This technique became the basis of Emmanuel's guitar style.\n\nWhile Emmanuel has never had formal music training, his playing ability has won him fans from all over the world. He is known to play percussion parts on the body of his guitar. As a solo performer he never plays to a set list and uses a minimum of effects. He usually completes recordings in one take.\n\nHe frequently uses his left thumb to fret bass notes on the 5th and 6th strings as well as playing chords such as Am and E with just two fingers. He uses a thumb pick mostly, a flat pick or just fingers.\n\n\nWhat follows is a collection of some of his albums...

His major works are made up of the triad of consecutive full-length releases on Eclipse -- Red Horse, White Mule (2002), Opium Musick (2003), and Raag Manifestos (2004) -- in addition to his 2005 opus Kensington Blues, released by Tequila Sunrise.\n\nIn 1993 Jack Rose joined the noise/drone band Pelt, releasing a handful of albums and EPs. Rose further developed his acoustic guitar technique as the band slowly shifted from its electric roots. Although Pelt frequently went on and off hiatus during Rose's most involved periods in the band, he didn't begin to concentrate on his own recordings until the early 2000s. 2001 saw his first self-released CD-R of mostly blues and ragtime. In 2002, this new focus culminated in his public transformation from Pelt member to solo artist on his first proper full-length, Red Horse, White Mule, released by Eclipse Records.\n\nHis depth of knowledge in the traditions of blues, ragtime and Eastern music are complemented by the avant-garde and experimental spirit of Pelt. Comparisons to American primitive guitarist John Fahey are frequent, but Rose has been praised by reviewers, fans, and contemporaries alike for rising to the challenge of playing in a unique style despite his affection for music originating in decades past.\n\nWhat follows is a collection of some of his albums...
