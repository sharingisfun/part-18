ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnquestionably an artist of the first rank.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Kurt Vonnegut\n\n\nErnest Hemingway's first new book of fiction since the publication of A Farewell to Arms in 1929 contains fourteen stories of varying length. Some of them have appeared in magazines but the majority have not been published before. The characters and backgrounds are widely varied. &quot;A Clean, Well-Lighted Place&quot; is about an old Spanish Beggar. &quot;Homage to Switzerland&quot; concerns various conversations at a Swiss railway-station restaurant. &quot;The Gambler, the Nun, and the Radio&quot; is laid in the accident ward of a hospital in Western United States, and so on. Ernest Hemingway made his literary start as a short-story writer. He has always excelled in that medium, and this volume reveals him at his best.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  A Clean, Well-lighted Place\nThis is another of Hemingway's dense vignettes, filled with nuance but spare in style. The anecdote revolves around the difference between a clean, bright cafe and a dark, not-so-clean, bar as a place for lonely men to spend the long, sleepless nights. Two waiters discuss a lingering patron in a cafe who overstays his welcome as the night wears on. The old man gets quietly drunk each night; just last week he tried to kill himself, but was rescued.\n  Tonight he tries to pass the night in a clean, well-lighted place. The young waiter, impatient, to get home to his wife, does not comprehend the importance of this place to this old man's survival. The older waiter, who does understand, walks into the night himself, unable to find his own clean, well-lighted place in which to pass a lonely and sleepless night.\n\n\n  God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\nTwo physicians sit in the Emergency Room of a Kansas City hospital on Christmas Day. The narrator's references to the incompetence or past errors of each is slipped quietly into the text as the story unfolds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f369dac2c60f9ec636b609ff5e2054ca9e5a8d7","amp;dn":"WINNER+TAKE+NOTHING+-+Ernest+Hemingway.+Stacy+Keach+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f369dac2c60f9ec636b609ff5e2054ca9e5a8d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,54,157,172,44,96,249,236,99,107,96,159,245,226,5,76,169,229,168,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
