Founded in 1852 as a pioneering museum of applied and decorative arts, today it has incomparable holdings spanning 2,000 years of artistic achievement in virtually every form: ceramics, metalwork, jewelry, furniture and woodwork, sculpture, textiles, paintings, drawings, and prints. A Grand Design, published in conjunction with a major traveling exhibition, brings together more than 250 of the V&amp;A's finest treasures and recounts the institution's rich and vibrant history. \nCollectively, these splendid objects illustrate how the museum sought to establish a canon of excellence for the decorative arts by acquiring examples of superior craftsmanship, aesthetic beauty, and artistic merit from many of the world's cultures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aacd5ebc3d098d993fc6a72683f2936be2186d3","amp;dn":"A+Grand+Design+-+The+Art+of+the+Victoria+and+Albert+Museum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aacd5ebc3d098d993fc6a72683f2936be2186d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,172,213,235,195,208,152,217,147,252,106,114,104,63,41,54,190,33,134,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
