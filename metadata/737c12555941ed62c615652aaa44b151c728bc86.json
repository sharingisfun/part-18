The movie Disney doesn't want you to see! Excellent video quality, captured from rare import Japanese Laserdisc. NEVER released by Disney in the US due to alledged racial stereotypes. This one is FAR SUPERIOR to the .avi format that is floating around. Join Uncle Remus, Brer Rabbit, and all the critters in this timeless classic set down on the plantation! It has some Japanese Subtitles, but only during a few of the songs. Two large chapters represent each side of the laserdisc. This movie is where the classic song &quot;Zippity Doo Dah&quot; originates. They use it now in all their promotions, but refuse to release the film. ISO file ready to drop into DVD Decrypter (free downloadable program) Just click MODE - ISO - WRITE and select the ISO file and you are ready to go! This is my first upload, so I hope everything goes well! READY TO BURN TO DVD!!!
