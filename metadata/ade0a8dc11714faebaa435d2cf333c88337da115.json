Marieb\nISBN-10: 0321750012\nISBN-13: 978-0321750013\nPages (Spiral-bound version): 388 (including index and credits page), 375 (excluding index and credits page).\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!\nSome of the pages are a little faded (seems to be due to my having moved around slightly while scanning ha ha) although the text for the most part is still perfectly readable. Also, my Lexmark scanner/printer goofed up on a few occasions while I was scanning these pages, so the quality will change throughout the pdf. Some of the images will appear to be darker and more black and white while others will look more &quot;grayscale&quot;. I do  not feel like going back to re-scan those pages just so the appearances of the pages are more consistent, especially given that this is a FREE pdf. This pdf is text searchable and the pdf is bookmarked by the individual exercises and sections, so if you are looking for a particular phrase, word, exercise/section, etc., you should have no trouble with this :)\n\nAlso, I am currently working on putting together an answer key for some of the laboratory review sheets; however, some people like a challenge and don't want the answer key (or they simply don't trust that I'll have the accurate answers in there lol). Because of that, I am going to upload this separately when it is done (will comment and post the link for that torrent when I am complete with it). In the meanwhile, there are a lot of online documents with the answer keys to the individual exercises; however, these online documents often times aren't quite the same as what is in this manual, which is why I want to put together this answer key in the first place by hand. I did get an A in this class (teacher didn't collect the review sheets however) so I know what I'm doing I think he he :)\n*******************************************************************************\nWith this being said, please enjoy this FREE anatomy laboratory manual. This may not seem practical given this is a lab manual (if you think about it), although there have been plenty of times in my particular anatomy lab class where we could actually use our computers if we wanted to (no chemicals or anything of the sort). So electronic versions of this lab manual do have their place afterall! Please seed this torrent when you are done.
