Beginning in 1987, Bill Drummond (alias King Boy D) and Jimmy Cauty (alias Rockman Rock) released hip hop-inspired and sample-heavy records as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, and on one occasion (the British number one hit single &quot;Doctorin' the Tardis&quot;) as The Timelords. As The KLF, Drummond and Cauty pioneered the genres &quot;stadium house&quot; (rave music with a pop-rock production and sampled crowd noise) and &quot;ambient house&quot;. The KLF released a series of international top-ten hits on their own KLF Communications record label, and became the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991. The duo also published a book, The Manual, and worked on a road movie called The White Room.\n\nFrom the outset, they adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novel series The Illuminatus! Trilogy, gaining notoriety for various anarchic situationist manifestations, including the defacement of billboard adverts, the posting of prominent cryptic advertisements in NME magazine and the mainstream press, and highly distinctive and unusual performances on Top of the Pops. Their most notorious performance was at the February 1992 BRIT Awards, where they fired machine gun blanks into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance announced The KLF's departure from the music business, and in May 1992 the duo deleted their entire back catalogue.\n\nWith The KLF's profits, Drummond and Cauty established the K Foundation and sought to subvert the art world, staging an alternative art award for the worst artist of the year and burning one million pounds sterling. Although Drummond and Cauty remained true to their word of May 1992ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted in the UKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they have released a small number of new tracks since then, as the K Foundation, The One World Orchestra and most recently, in 1997, as 2K. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White Room 1991\n\n\nThe White Room was a 1991 album by British house music group The KLF. Originally scheduled to be released in 1989 as the soundtrack to a film of the same name, the album's direction was changed after both the film and the original soundtrack LP were cancelled at the last moment. Most of the tracks on the original version of the album are present in the final release, though in significantly remixed form.\n\nThe White Room was supposed to be followed by a darker, harder complementary album called The Black Room, but the latter was never released due to the KLF's retirement from the music business in 1992.\n\nThe White Room was conceived as the soundtrack to a road movie, also called The White Room, about the KLF's search for the mystical White Room that would enable them to be released from their contract with Eternity. Parts of the movie were filmed in the Sierra Nevada region of Spain, using the money that the duo had made as The Timelords with the 1988 UK novelty pop No. 1 &quot;Doctorin' the Tardis&quot;.[2] The soundtrack album contained pop-house versions of some of the KLF's earlier &quot;Pure Trance&quot; singles, as well as new songs.\n\nThe film project was fraught with difficulties and setbacks, including dwindling funds. Drummond and Cauty had released &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot; (  sample (helpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢info)), a single from the original soundtrack, in the hopes that it could &quot;rescue them from the jaws of bankruptcy&quot;; it flopped commercially, however, failing to make even the UK top 100. As a consequence, The White Room film project was put on hold, and the KLF abandoned the musical direction of the soundtrack and single.[3] Neither the film nor its soundtrack were formally released, although bootleg copies of both exist.\n\nMeanwhile, the KLF's single &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot;, which had originally been released in 1988 and largely ignored by the public, was generating acclaim within the underground clubs of continental Europe; according to KLF Communications, &quot;The KLF were being feted by all the 'right' DJs&quot;.[3] This prompted Drummond and Cauty to pursue the acid house tone of their Pure Trance series. A further Pure Trance release, &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot;, followed.\n\nIn October 1990, the KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound they dubbed &quot;Stadium House&quot;. Songs from The White Room soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled &quot;Additional Communicators&quot;), a sample-heavy pop-rock production, and crowd noise samples. The &quot;Stadium House&quot; versions of &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot; and &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot; were immediate hits, with &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot; becoming the KLF's only number-one release. These &quot;Stadium House&quot; tracks made up a large part of The White Room when it was eventually released in March 1991, substantially reworked from the original soundtrack version.\n\nOf the original mixes recorded for the film soundtrack, only &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot; and a version of &quot;Build a Fire&quot; saw legitimate commercial release.\n\nAllmusic said that The White Room &quot;represents the commercial and artistic peak of late-'80s acid-house&quot;[4] and Q magazine called it &quot;strikingly imaginative&quot; and &quot;a more subtle form of subterfuge&quot; than previous works.[5] A retrospective review by Splendid Magazine thought some of the tracks to be filler and the album &quot;silly&quot; in places, but were extremely impressed by the &quot;Stadium House&quot; songs. &quot;As providers of perverse, throwaway, three-minute pop-song manna,&quot; they concluded, &quot;the KLF were punk rock, the Renaissance, Andy Warhol and Jesus Christ all rolled into one.&quot;[6]\n\nIn 1993, NME staff and contributors voted the album the 81st best of all time.[7][8] The Guardian listed it at the 89th best British album of all time[9] and Scotland on Sunday listed the album in their &quot;Essential 100&quot;.[10] Readers of Scotland's Is this music? magazine voted The White Room the 44th best &quot;Scottish&quot; LP of all time.[11] In 2000 Q magazine placed it at number 89 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. It is also featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. \n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;What Time Is Love?&quot; (LP Mix)\n2.\t&quot;Make It Rain&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot; (Live at the S.S.L.)\n4.\t&quot;Church of the KLF&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot; (Live from the Lost Continent) (LP Mix)\n6.\t&quot;Build a Fire&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;The White Room&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;No More Tears&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Justified and Ancient&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9b3de1093eaf9bae9cd9f7e0befa3bdae6455b","amp;dn":"The+KLF+-+The+White+Room+1991+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9b3de1093eaf9bae9cd9f7e0befa3bdae6455b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,155,61,225,9,62,175,155,174,156,217,247,224,190,250,59,218,230,69,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
