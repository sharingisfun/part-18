After a string of solo records she did a fantastic heavy progressive rock title with Blues Creation (1971). A few years later Maki formed a new group named Oz, which recorded 4 titles, including double live album. This excellent debut LP was released in January 1975 by Polydor Records and offered richly produced and very enjoyable combi nation of British-styled progressive rock tracks (sung in Japanese) similar to Barclay James Harvest and Pink Floyd, but also tightly arranged and quite powerful hard rock epics in Blues Creation and Deep Purple vein.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c054ba084ff01004affbed3fef203b95d5fbbb8e","amp;dn":"Carmen+Maki+%26amp%3B+Oz+%281975%2F2013%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c054ba084ff01004affbed3fef203b95d5fbbb8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,84,186,8,79,240,16,4,175,251,237,63,239,32,59,149,213,251,187,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
