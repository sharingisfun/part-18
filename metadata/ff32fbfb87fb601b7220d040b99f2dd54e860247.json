The fourth largest city in the US, it was also one of the wealthiest, housing the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earliest shopping malls. AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first major freeway was built in Detroit to facilitate the increasing number of commuters into the city. \n\nBut the 21st century has seen the American dream, powered by the Big Three, slide into a nightmare for Detroit. Levels of black inner city poverty, hunger and unemployment have reached critical proportions, in grim contrast to the affluent white suburbs which surround the city. \nRequiem for Detroit? includes interviews with the people living amongst the deserted auto plants, closed schools and failing infrastructure, as well as those who are based in the consumer utopia of the suburbs. It also features interviews with Motown star Martha Reeves and beat poet John Sinclair. \n\nJulien Temple, Director, commented:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDetroit was the frontier city in the US, powering the American dream. What I find fascinating is the fact that it is still ahead of the game, becoming the first big US city to virtually fall off the map.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n=== File Information ===\nFile Name:            Requiem for Detroit.avi \n\nDuration:      01:15:23 (113,076 fr)\nFile Size:            619 MB (or 634,794 KB or 650,029,056 bytes) bytes\n\n\n=== Video Information ===\nVideo Codec Name:     XviD\nVideo Bitrate:        1009 kb/s\nBits / Pixel:         0.198 bits/pixel\nResolution:           608x336 (1.81:1) \nframes Per Second:    25.000 fps\n\n\n=== Audio Information ===\nAudio Codec:          0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate:        132 kb/s (66/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90\nFrequency:            48000 Hz\n\n\n-------------\n\nMore stuff here:                                                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/MartinBLCK/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/MartinBLCK/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff32fbfb87fb601b7220d040b99f2dd54e860247","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Requiem+for+Detroit+-+%2813th+March+2010%29+%5BPDTV+%28XviD%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff32fbfb87fb601b7220d040b99f2dd54e860247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,50,251,251,135,251,96,27,114,32,208,64,185,159,45,213,78,134,2,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
