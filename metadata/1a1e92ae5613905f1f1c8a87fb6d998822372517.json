Ray, Martyn G. Sneesby (1998).pdf\n\nISBN 9056991361\n\nThis new edition follows the original format, which combines a detailed case study - the production of phthalic anhydride - with practical advice and comprehensive background information. Guiding the reader through all major aspects of a chemical engineering design, the text includes both the initial technical and economic feasibility study as well as the detailed design stages. Each aspect of the design is illustrated with material from an award-winning student design project. \nThe book embodies the &quot;learning by doing&quot; approach to design. The student is directed to appropriate information sources and is encouraged to make decisions at each stage of the design process rather than simply following a design method. Thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, the accompanying text includes developments in important areas and many new references","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1e92ae5613905f1f1c8a87fb6d998822372517","amp;dn":"Chemical+Engineering+Design+Project+-+A+Case+Study+Approach+2nd+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1e92ae5613905f1f1c8a87fb6d998822372517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,30,146,174,86,19,144,95,31,28,138,135,251,109,153,136,34,55,37,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
