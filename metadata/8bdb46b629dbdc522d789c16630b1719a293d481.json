We tend to see the Second World War as a man's war, featuring Spitfire crews and brave deeds on the Normandy beaches. But in conditions of &quot;Total War&quot; millions of women - in the Services and on the Home Front - demonstrated that they were cleverer, more broad-minded and altogether more complex than anyone had ever guessed. &quot;Millions Like Us&quot; tells the story of how these women loved, suffered, laughed, grieved and dared; how they re-made their world in peacetime. And how they would never be the same again...&quot;Vividly entertaining, uplifting and humbling, &quot;Millions Like Us&quot; deserves to be a bestseller&quot;. (Bel Mooney, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;). &quot;Passionate, fascinating, profoundly sympathetic&quot;. (Artemis Cooper, &quot;Evening Standard&quot;). Virginia Nicholson was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and grew up in Yorkshire and Sussex. She studied at Cambridge University and lived abroad in France and Italy, then worked as a documentary researcher for BBC Television. Her books include the acclaimed social history &quot;Among the Bohemians - Experiments in Living 1900-1939&quot;, and &quot;Singled Out - How Two Million Women Survived Without Men after the First World War&quot;, both published by Penguin in 2002 and 2007. She is married to a writer, has three children and lives in Sussex.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img600/985/cldv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img600/985/cldv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nVirginia Nicholson was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1955.
