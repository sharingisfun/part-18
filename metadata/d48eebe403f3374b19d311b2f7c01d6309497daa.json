Most new televisions do support both PAL and NTSC 50Hz and 60Hz.\n\n\nRipkit what I used to get this file was named: GH5 RipKit_PAL-Drake\nYou can find it here: http://thedgtl.net/\n\nIt took really long to run that ripkit even I have double core 2,8GHz , about 3h so I upload this to save space and time.\n\n\n\nIf you have to patch to esr then here are the hashes:\n\nHashes:\n------------------\nWithout ESR:\n  CRC32: 7C4CCE06\n  MD5: 7F4EEF2FA961FDD93A07EB803811251E\n  SHA-1: F7886AC8BF15812DEBFC5488B9F6CD81D701FA63\n\nWith ESR:\n  CRC32: 31BB8415\n  MD5: 591321A7F7B292877AED8E7A8EAE9B06\n  SHA-1: 43CC71BBFBEA803ACD91AB91F512FEF46542FCA4\n\nIts working GREAT! I can't notice audio quality loss and I play it alltime =)\n\nSpecial thanks of course to drakia who did ripkit.\n\nHow to Burn to dvd:\n1. Download this\n2. You get gh5.rar file\n3. Download Winrar or if you already have it then extract it\n4. You get gh5.iso\n\n4,5: IF you use memory card with ESR to run it then you have to patch it with it!\n\n5. Download Img Burn here: http://www.imgburn.com/ or if you have it then skip this\n6. Start Img Burn \n7. Choose Write Image to disc\n8. Choose gh5.iso to burn and put Empty DVD into your Burning DVD-Station\n9. Best DVD to get it work are:\n\n..1 DVD-R\n..2 DVD+R\n..3 DVD-RW\n\nSo use DVD-R discs cause they are most cheapest and also works best.\n\n10. Start burning process at 2x speed and wait for it to finish.\n11. Take disc and put it into your modded playstation 2 dvd-station and ENJOY!\n12. If it freezes then your disc is bad quality and you can burn it to new DVD.\n \nI had to burn it twice cause first dvd was fuckwed so it freezed. Second one were perfect and worked great =)  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d48eebe403f3374b19d311b2f7c01d6309497daa","amp;dn":"Guitar+Hero+5+%5BDVD5%5D+PAL+%5BPS2%5D+fliPo+feat.+Drakia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d48eebe403f3374b19d311b2f7c01d6309497daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,142,235,228,3,243,55,75,25,211,17,178,247,192,29,99,9,73,125,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
