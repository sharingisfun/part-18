(Wiley-VCH, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nWritten by authors from different fields to reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the topic, this book guides the reader through new nano-materials processing inspired by nature. \r\nStructured around general principles, each selection and explanation is motivated by particular biological case studies. This provides the background for elucidating the particular principle in a second section. In the third part, examples for applying the principle to materials processing are given, while in a fourth subsection each chapter is supplemented by a selection of relevant experimental and theoretical techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d38661f1768ebc0ef3326dfd893a38ef017ff17","amp;dn":"Bio-Nanomaterials+-+Designing+Materials+Inspired+by+Nature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d38661f1768ebc0ef3326dfd893a38ef017ff17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,56,102,31,23,104,235,192,239,51,38,223,216,147,163,142,240,23,255,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
