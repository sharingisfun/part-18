This is American Top 40, my name is Casey Kasem and our countdown to the number one song in the land continues.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a duo who became celebrities in Australia, not by being rock 'n' roll stars, but for stopping a robber armed with a shotgun.\n\nThere is a band in the countdown who didn't have a record deal, never played a concert together, and didn't even have a name the day Van Halen asked them to be their opening act.\n\nA listener wants to know who holds the all-time record for the most top ten hits. Casey says that distinction belongs to the singing legend whose record-setting 56 top ten hits include the biggest selling single of all time.\n\nThere is a hit by the woman who was first recording act to make the top 10 on the pop, country, soul, and dance charts.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What album has spent the most weeks on the Billboard album chart?&quot; It is an album that debut 12 years before this broadcast, and was still on the chart as of its airing. It finally fell off the album chart after 741 weeks or just over 14 years.\n\nLW#1: Can't Fight This Feeling - REO Speedwagon\n40:    Radioactive - The Firm\n39:    Solid - Ashford &amp; Simpson\n38:    All She Wants To Do Is Dance - Don Henley\n37:    Method Of Modern Love - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n36:    Along Comes A Woman - Chicago\n35:    Why Can't I Have You - The Cars\n34:    This Is Not America - David Bowie/Pat Metheny\nLDD:    Help Is On It's Way - Little River Band\n33:    Rhythm Of The Night - DeBarge\n32:    Crazy For You - Madonna\n31:    Mr. Telephone Man - New Edition\n30:    Take Me With U - Prince and The Revolution With Apolonia\n29:    Turn Up The Radio - Autograph\n28:    Obsession - Animotion\n27:    Naughty Naughty - John Parr\n26:    Missing You - Diana Ross\n25:    I'm On Fire - Bruce Springsteen\n24:    Nightshift - Commodores\n23:    Somebody - Bryan Adams\n22:    Easy Lover - Philip Bailey with Phil Collins\n21:    Keeping The Faith - Billy Joel    \n20:    Loverboy - Billy Ocean\n19:    The Old Man Down The Road - John Fogerty\n18:    Just Another Night - Mick Jagger\n17:    Sugar Walls - Sheena Easton\n16:    Save A Prayer - Duran Duran\n15:    I Want To Know What Love Is - Foreigner\n14:    High On You - Survivor\n13:    Misled - Kool &amp; The Gang\nLDD:    Colour My World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chicago\n12:    Neutron Dance - Pointer Sisters    \n11:    Only The Young - Journey\n10:    Relax - Frankie Goes To Hollywood\n9:    Private Dancer - Tina Turner\n8:    Lovergirl - Teena Marie\n7:    Careless Whisper - Wham\n6:    Too Late For Goodbyes - Julian Lennon\n5:    One More Night - Phil Collins\n4:    California Girls - David Lee Roth\n3:    Material Girl - Madonna\n2:    The Heat Is On - Glenn Frey\n1:    Can't Fight This Feeling - REO Speedwagon    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84949b01677a7340f780ca7f7ced11f111182c7d","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1985_March_16th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84949b01677a7340f780ca7f7ced11f111182c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,148,155,1,103,122,115,64,247,128,202,127,124,237,17,241,17,24,44,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
