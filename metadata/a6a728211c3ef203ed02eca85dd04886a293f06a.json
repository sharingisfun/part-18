The next president declared upon Nixon's resignation &quot;our long national nightmare is over&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€but then congressional investigators exposed the CIA for assassinating foreign leaders. The collapse of the South Vietnamese government rendered moot the sacrifice of some 58,000 American lives. The economy was in tatters. And as Americans began thinking about their nation in a new wayÃ¢â‚¬â€as one more nation among nations, no more providential than any otherÃ¢â‚¬â€the pundits declared that from now on successful politicians would be the ones who honored this chastened new national mood.\n\nRonald Reagan never got the message. Which was why, when he announced his intention to challenge President Ford for the 1976 Republican nomination, those same pundits dismissed himÃ¢â‚¬â€until, amazingly, it started to look like he just might win. He was inventing the new conservative political culture we know now, in which a new vision of patriotism rooted in a sense American limits was derailed by the rise in America's Bicentennial year of the smiling politician from Hollywood. Against a backdrop of melodramas from the Arab oil embargo to Patty Hearst to the near-bankruptcy of America's greatest city, The Invisible Bridge asks the question: what does it mean to believe in America? To wave a flagÃ¢â‚¬â€or to reject the glibness of the flag wavers?\n\n\nBy Rick Perlstein\nPublished by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 1066 pages, English (1476782415)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6a728211c3ef203ed02eca85dd04886a293f06a","amp;dn":"The+Invisible+Bridge+%28ePUB+%26amp%3B+AZW3%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6a728211c3ef203ed02eca85dd04886a293f06a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,167,40,33,28,62,242,3,237,2,236,168,93,208,72,134,162,147,240,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
