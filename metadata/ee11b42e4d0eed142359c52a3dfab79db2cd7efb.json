So, sometimes, I receive some real good things, like this Charlie Parker gem (or, in previuos torrents, Stan Getz)\nBut, it is not a usual plastic jewel case. Instead, the two cd's are packed in cardboard box, the first cd opening on the left, second on the right and in the middle there is a very good 20 pages booklet. So the artwork is hard to scan, yet there is front, back, the cd's and the bookle included in the torrent.. So if you know &quot;The Bird&quot; enjoy and if you don't, dl it and read the booklet while listening and you will realise why Charlie Parker is considered on of the most powerful and innovtive jazzers ever.\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project)\n\nIn this project we, fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :)\n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008, encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s\nGet Your Free Copy of the EAC and FLAC suite at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP project!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork.
