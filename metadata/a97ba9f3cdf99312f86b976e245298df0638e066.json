As with Art Tatum,\n\nBooker died of uremia (kidney failure.)  Brownie died on the highway.\n\n\nThe thing about Booker is dissonance.  Dissonance is what made Ellington great.\n\nDissonance is harmonic complexity.  It adds a pleasant confusion and thickness\n\nto music.\n\n\nThis record is the last of Booker's 4 albums as leader.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a97ba9f3cdf99312f86b976e245298df0638e066","amp;dn":"BOOKER+LITTLE%2CVictory+and+Sorrow%2C1961%2CBethlehem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a97ba9f3cdf99312f86b976e245298df0638e066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,123,169,243,205,249,147,18,248,107,151,110,36,82,152,223,6,56,224,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
