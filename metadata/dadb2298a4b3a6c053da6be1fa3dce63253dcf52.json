A 1974 teledrama of the Cuban Missile Crisis, I first saw it when taking some post-graduate classes in History. Let me the first to point out that one thing that does NOT happen in masterÃƒÂ¢??s degree level classes in history is having a class watch a video ÃƒÂ¢?? thatÃƒÂ¢??s typically reserved for the babysitting that passes for history education in American High schools. In short, this film is THAT good. Unlike just about every other historical film ever made, this is actually what happened. Remarkably, this film still manages to be very entertaining as well as educational. I post below the amazon write-up. For those of you looking for exciting footage of warplanes or explosions, donÃƒÂ¢??t bother ÃƒÂ¢?? this isnÃƒÂ¢??t for you. This is for adults. This is the process that a competent government of exceptional people goes through when presented with problems that exceed human capability. The mentality that would find this boring would go a long way to explaining the current state of foreign affairs of the US government, cuz I would take a bet that George W. Bush would ALSO find this to be boring. If that sounds snotty and elitist, good. It was meant to be. I ripped this to avi because the DVD has no extras.\n\nAmazon.com\nWithout becoming didactic, The Missiles of October does an outstanding job of presenting many points of view on the Cuban missile crisis. The film humanizes Kennedy&amp;#039;s near impossible task of avoiding war without compromising national security. The earnestness of this 1974 made-for-television dramatization may briefly remind one of social studies class--indeed it is at times difficult to maintain consciousness while the extensive cast of characters is being introduced at the opening. Not to worry, though--soon the power plays begin and The Missiles of October becomes completely gripping. Actual news footage is spliced in with the action, nicely serving as exposition and driving home just how very close the world came to nuclear war. A crew of excellent character actors flesh out the story and reveal the psychological games behind the language of diplomacy. William Devane takes on the difficult task of playing John F. Kennedy. While he doesn&amp;#039;t quite capture Kennedy&amp;#039;s charisma, he does occupy the role comfortably and effectively conveys the president&amp;#039;s deep worry and determination to avoid war. Martin Sheen plays an engaging Robert Kennedy and Michael Lerner, oddly enough, manages to make Pierre Salinger absolutely fascinating. --Ali Davis\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071847/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071847/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dadb2298a4b3a6c053da6be1fa3dce63253dcf52","amp;dn":"The+Missiles+of+October+-+Cuban+Missile+Crisis+1974+teledrama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dadb2298a4b3a6c053da6be1fa3dce63253dcf52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,219,34,152,164,179,166,192,83,218,107,225,250,61,206,99,37,61,207,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
