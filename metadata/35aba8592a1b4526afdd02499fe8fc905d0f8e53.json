The character and experiences of Nino could&amp;#039;ve been either of my two uncles who migrated in the mid-1950&amp;#039;s.\n\nNotwithstanding the story, it&amp;#039;s an amazing photo story of what Australia was like for millions or migrants in the&amp;#039;60&amp;#039;s - particularly the larger cities of Sydney and Melbourne. The character of the Aussies is spot on - you can meet them any day on any street in any city of Australia right now. The aussie &quot;mateship&quot; unique to the Australian psyche is very well portrayed; the Aussie mentality of always willing to give a bloke a fair go and taking people for what they are - fair dinkum - and not who they are is also well captured. The actors are the creme de la creme of Australian theatre, tv, radio and film - most of them appearing in many Australian dramas of later years such as Homicide, Division 4, Number 96, Prisoner, Skippy(Ed Devereaux &amp; Tony Bonner), and Crocodile Dundee (John Meillon)\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a refreshing retro to an era of quality storylines, acting and the promotion of individual potential. The language, the 6 o&amp;#039;clock closings of the pubs, the white aussie&amp;#039;s prejudice to the &amp;#039;Eye-tie&quot;(ITalian) and anyone else who wasn&amp;#039;t a Smith, Brown, McKenzie, O&amp;#039;Farrell is as accurate as I experienced. And all served up with a laugh.\n\nAlong with the book, the film provides a timeless piece of well recommended entertainment and history.\n\n-IMdB user comment\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nCD1 File Size (in bytes):                           733,751,296                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             96          \nPreload (in ms):                                96       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Split         \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  xvid              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            00:47:58                \nFrame Count:                                    71947             \nFrame Width (pixels):                           640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):                          368                  \nFrame Aspect Ratio (e.g &quot;1.3333&quot;):                        \nFrame Aspect Ratio (e.g. &quot;4:3&quot;):                             \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;SAR&quot;):                                          \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.739                     \nFrames Per Second:                              ***ERROR***                     \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1715                 \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot;
