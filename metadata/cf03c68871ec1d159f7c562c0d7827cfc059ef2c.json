ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet the Party StartedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ provided her breakthrough, its hedonism balanced by its raw-nerve sequel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Let Me Get Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and from there she racked up a decadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth of hits, bouncing between these two extremes. Released in 2010, Greatest HitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦So Far!!! rounds up the great majority of these hits, bypassing some singles -- her debut ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMost GirlsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Make Me Sick,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGod Is a DJ,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFunhouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and, most regrettably, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFeel Good Time,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ her Beck/William Orbit-written entry for the Charlie's Angels II: Full Throttle soundtrack -- but hitting all the blockbusters (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere You Go,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust Like a Pill,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrouble,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStupid Girls,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œU + Ur Hand,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo What,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlease DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Leave MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) while adding two new entries to her canon: the rabble-rousing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRaise Your GlassÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the profane love letter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œF**kin' Perfect.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Both new entries are fine, even if they border ever so slightly on the conventional, but the real story of Greatest HitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦So Far!!! is naturally the well-known hits that remain smart, addictive pop even after innumerable plays. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf03c68871ec1d159f7c562c0d7827cfc059ef2c","amp;dn":"Pink+-+Greatest+Hits...So+Far%21%21%21+%28Deluxe+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf03c68871ec1d159f7c562c0d7827cfc059ef2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,3,198,136,113,236,29,21,159,124,86,44,13,120,39,207,192,89,239,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
