I started listening to Naxos CDs only recently on the recommendation of BBC Radio 3's CDmasters, and have been hugely impressed.\n\nI gather Jeno Jando was a rival (and friend) of Andras Schiff at the Budapest Conservatory.\n\nOver the years I have owned several recordings of these masterpieces, and I rate this cycle as being one of the best.\n\nWhen one thinks of great pianists, one thinks of Perahia, Schiff, Ashkenazy, Richter, etc., and it is totally justified, but surely this apparently self effacing man deserves to be mentioned in the same breath? His output of recordings is huge, he has stuck with a budget label (although Naxos can claim to be &quot;a big boy&quot; these days), knowing it would bring his playing to a wider audience in a bigger repetoire, and his playing draws comparison with the best. The only thing he lacks, is recognition! I sincerely hope he receives it soon!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:912b8b8d2fbca1adaab5764d6b7710ecaed81388","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+Complete+Piano+Sonatas+-+Jeno+Jando","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"912b8b8d2fbca1adaab5764d6b7710ecaed81388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,43,139,141,47,188,161,173,170,181,118,77,107,119,16,236,174,216,19,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
