Some of Jane's students happen to be members of a street gang known as the &quot;Kings of Destruction&quot; (KOD), led by Juan Lacas, who has been terrorizing Jane. After Jane's kneecap is broken by a big seminole named Bull, she tells Shale that she believes Lacas ordered the attack, so Shale goes undercover as Jane's substitute, and initially, Jane has no idea that Shale is doing this. At the school, Shale meets principal Claude Rolle, librarian Hannah Dillon, and english and drama teacher Darrell Sherman. It turns out that Lacas is one of Jane's students. As Shale investigates the attack on Jane, he discovers that drugs are being circulated into the school. Shale even investigates local drug kingpin Johnny Glades, who may or may not have someone inside the school distributing the drugs for him. Lives are threatened as Shale investigates and sets out to clean up the crime infested school.              \n\nACTORS: \nTom Berenger, Raymond Cruz, William Forsythe, Luis GuzmÃƒÂ¡n, Richard Brooks, Ana Azcuy, \n\nRELEASED: \n 19 April 1996 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117774/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117774/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 2257471175 bytes (2.10 GiB), duration: 01:55:02, avg.bitrate: 2617 kb/s\nAudio: ac3, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 1280x692, 23.98 fps(r) (eng)\nSubtitles: eng \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=49130002981022207118.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=49130002981022207118.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=80814671152344657595.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=80814671152344657595.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=81701990954563615124.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=81701990954563615124.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : x0r\n Movie Share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d26672a8adca2bb5c6ef81cc7ab2338c35b09f0","amp;dn":"The+Substitute+1996+720p+BRRip+x264-x0r","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d26672a8adca2bb5c6ef81cc7ab2338c35b09f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,38,103,42,138,220,162,187,92,110,248,28,199,171,35,56,195,91,9,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
