Despite his yearnings for the finer things in life, Carey cannot extricate himself from a mutually destructive relationship with sluttish waitress Mildred Rogers (Bette Davis). After an incredible series of emotional disasters, Carey finally finds happiness in the arms of Sally Altheny (Frances Dee). The industry buzz in 1934 indicated that Bette Davis was a shoe-in for an Academy Award for her savage portrayal of Mildred, but her home studio Warner Bros. failed to mount an adequate publicity campaign on Davis&amp;#039; behalf, allegedly because she&amp;#039;d made the film on loan-out to RKO and Warners wasn&amp;#039;t about to heap praise upon a rival. It is now generally conceded that Davis&amp;#039; Oscar win for 1935&amp;#039;s Dangerous was consolation for her losing the statuette in 1934. Long out of circulation due to the 1946 remake, the 1934 Of Human Bondage has since slipped into the public domain, and is now seen more often than either of the subsequent remakes (the last was in 1964).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nspan subs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3271891/of-human-bondage-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3271891/of-human-bondage-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nJohn Cromwell\n\n        Leslie Howard\t ... \tPhilip Carey\n\n\tBette Davis\t... \tMildred Rogers\n\tFrances Dee\t... \tSally Athelny\n\tKay Johnson\t... \tNorah\n\tReginald Denny\t... \tHarry Griffiths\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:22:41\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 608x464\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 959 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 115 Kbps\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b6d7f03bf267ee55f79f9f4446956b1a629a142","amp;dn":"Of+Human+Bondage++%281934%29+Bette+Davis.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b6d7f03bf267ee55f79f9f4446956b1a629a142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,109,127,3,191,38,126,229,95,121,249,244,68,105,86,177,166,41,161,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
