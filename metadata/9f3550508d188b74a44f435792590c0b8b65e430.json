Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city&amp;#039;s streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country.\n\nI have a very slow connection so please share and if you can upload it to file storing servers that&amp;#039;s even better. Just add links in comments.\n\n\n\n\nxxxyyyzzz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f3550508d188b74a44f435792590c0b8b65e430","amp;dn":"New+York%2C+A+Documentary+Film+-+01+-+The+Country+And+The+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f3550508d188b74a44f435792590c0b8b65e430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,53,80,80,141,24,139,116,164,79,67,87,146,89,12,11,139,101,228,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
