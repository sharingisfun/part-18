By living amongst them for a week, what will he discover about the extremes of this misunderstood country in the 21st Century?\n\n\n1)  The White Slums \nIn the first episode, Reggie spends a week in South Africa's largest white squatter camp, Coronation Park, outside Johannesburg. South Africa has a white population of approximately 4.6 million and during apartheid the racist political system elevated them into a privileged position. Today, however, white youth charities claim that up to 400,000 of them now live below the poverty line, with many shacked up in small, make-shift camps, although these figures remain hotly disputed. But behind the headlines lies an uncomfortable question: are young white South Africans now the ones being discriminated against by being on the wrong side of affirmative action? And if so, will black and white ever be truly equal in South Africa?\n\n2)  Knife Crime ER \nSouth Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world and the Cape Flats outside Cape Town are now the epicentre of violent crime in the country. Reggie spends a week in a new district hospital in the fastest growing township, struggling to cope with the victims of these attacks. On any given weekend, the young doctor's deal with up to 100 stabbings and assaults and 80 per cent of those admitted are under 25. By living and working with the doctors and patients, Reggie tries to find out why it is almost inevitable for young men just like him to get into violent scrapes here. It's a journey that leads him into the heart of the township and the conflict.\n\n3)  The Millionaire Preacher \nSouth Africa is a country devoted to God, and Pentecostal 'Megachurches' are booming. But as well as conventional priests and bishops, thousands of young people follow self-styled prophets. Reggie spends a week with one of the most controversial and colourful of them all, Prophet Mboro. In a world of witchcraft, exorcisms and heavily armed guards, Mboro is adored by the thousands of followers in his megachurch and renowned as much for his dancing as the 'miracles' he performs. Reggie has already rejected African Pentecostal faith once in his life, and now he tries to discover whether a multi-millionaire King of Bling with 30 flash cars can really be a messenger from God. But the deeper Reggie digs, the more conflicted he becomes- until he starts to confront some truths much closer to home.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/3554/40ij.jpg&quot;
