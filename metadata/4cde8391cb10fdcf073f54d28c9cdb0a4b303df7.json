Originally planned by Schenker as a collection of covers featuring himself and a &quot;revolving all-star cast of guest musicians,&quot;\r\n the album was labeled and marketed as an MSG album, with the result that Schenker received only a flat fee. In 2007, it was re-released as a Michael Schenker solo album under the title Doctor Doctor: The Kulick Sessions and included 4 additional tracks (1-2 and 13-14). The album was re-issued again in 2011 with the title By Invitation Only by the Store For Music label, including the song &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;, which Schenker and McAuley had recorded for the Iron Maiden tribute album Numbers from the Beast. Now re-released again in this present format as Blood Of The Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nLength : 01:15:50\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\n01. Out In The Fields [feat. Gary Barden] (04:28)\r\n02. Save Yourself [feat.
