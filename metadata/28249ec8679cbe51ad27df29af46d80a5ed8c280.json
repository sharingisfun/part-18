It was released by Illusive Sounds in March 2006 as both vinyl and CD releases. The title of the album is a metaphor for Australian hip hop being the 'underdog' of the Australian music industry, and affirming that it is now time for it to rise up.\n\nTRACK LISTINGS\n\n1.\t&quot;The Dreamer&quot;  \t                0:51\n2.\t&quot;It's Working&quot;      \t        4:08\n3.\t&quot;Up Jumped The Boogie&quot;  \t3:57\n4.\t&quot;Then Till Now&quot; \t        3:47\n5.\t&quot;Coppin' It Sweet&quot; \t        3:54\n6.\t&quot;Get Your Boof On&quot; \t        4:17\n7.\t&quot;Get Loose (featuring Hyjak)&quot; \t3:30\n8.\t&quot;Mad Tight&quot; \t                3:39\n9.\t&quot;Nowhere But Up&quot;                3:19\n10.\t&quot;Watch Your Mouth (featuring Mystro)&quot;   3:56\n11.\t&quot;Party at My Place (featuring Motley)&quot;  4:18\n12.\t&quot;Evening Breeze&quot; \t                3:11\n13.\t&quot;That Feeling&quot; \t                        3:50\n14.\t&quot;Lights Camera Action&quot; \t                3:59\n15.\t&quot;Soldier On (featuring Kye)&quot;\t        9:58\n16.\t&quot;Good Mourning Australia&quot;  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28249ec8679cbe51ad27df29af46d80a5ed8c280","amp;dn":"Bliss+N+Eso+-+Day+Of+The+Dog.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28249ec8679cbe51ad27df29af46d80a5ed8c280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,36,158,200,103,156,190,81,173,39,223,41,175,70,216,10,94,216,194,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
