The Fall of Fujimori tells the story of\nFujimori&amp;#039;s tumultuous presidency and fall from grace. Peruvian born, \nthe son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori&amp;#039;s ethnic background was \nbelieved to have boosted his vote among Peru&amp;#039;s Native Americans, \nmany of whom hold a historic distrust for their countrymen of Spanish\ndescent. There was also an element of forlorn hope that electing \nFujimori might bring Peru some of the economic success that made \nJapan such a powerhouse. However from his election in June 1990 to \nhis resignation, faxed from a Tokyo hotel, in November 2000 it was \nnot the economy but his controversial tactics in fighting illicit \ndrugs and terrorism, which came to define the presidency of Alberto\nFujimori. Director Ellen Perry uses never-before seen footage from \nthe regime, together with the first in-depth interview since his \nexile with Fujimori himself, to build an intimate portrait of a \nmodern dictator. \n(From Peru, in Spanish, English and Japanese, with English subtitles) \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0ae822e5446fca859b153b1e8c862af58f1108a","amp;dn":"Peru+-+The+Fall+of+Fujimori+%282005-TVRip-d0x%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0ae822e5446fca859b153b1e8c862af58f1108a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,174,130,46,84,70,252,168,89,177,83,177,232,200,98,175,88,241,16,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
