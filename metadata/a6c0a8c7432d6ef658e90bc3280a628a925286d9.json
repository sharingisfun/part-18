The edited version was so rotten, he tried to have his name removed from the credits; it is included here for completists.\n\nParents are away from home working in wartime production, young people are left to their own devices and drift into a life of crime. If Lewton had had his way, this might have been a 1940s version of The Wild One or A Clockwork Orange; instead it looks more like Reefer Madness. There are some interesting scenes for those who want to look out for them.\n\nRipped from tape. In VOB format, plays on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6c0a8c7432d6ef658e90bc3280a628a925286d9","amp;dn":"Youth+Runs+Wild+%281944%29+Val+Lewton+teensploitation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6c0a8c7432d6ef658e90bc3280a628a925286d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,192,168,199,67,45,110,246,88,233,11,195,40,10,98,138,146,82,134,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
