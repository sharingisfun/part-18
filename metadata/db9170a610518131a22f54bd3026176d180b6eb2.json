They formed in 1974, and are best known for their 1984 single &quot;Rock You&quot;. The original lineup was formed by drummer Bruce Arnold, and consisted of lead vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Ron Watson and Rick &quot;Minstrel&quot; Trembley, keyboardist Don Simmons, and bassist Keith &quot;Bert&quot; Zurbrigg. Their most well known lineup, however, and the one that recorded &quot;Rock You&quot;, was the 80s version of the band: Vollmer on vocals, accompanied by guitarists Brent &quot;The Doctor&quot; Doerner and Paul Hackman, bassist Daryl Gray, and drummer Greg &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz. The history of the band has been marked by many lineup changes, with Vollmer being the sole constant member and only remaining member of the original lineup. Although guitarist Paul Hackman was killed in a tour bus accident in 1992, the surviving members of the 80s lineup reunited in 2009 for an album and continue to tour in 2010.\n\nHelix have toured with bands such as KISS, Aerosmith, Rush, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e, Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Heart, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Ian Gillan, and MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead among others.\n\nTheir most recent studio album is 2009's Vagabond Bones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmash Hits... Unplugged! 2010\n\n\n\nSmash Hits...Unplugged! is an acoustic studio album by the heavy metal band Helix. \nIt was released in November 2010 via the band's official site and at shows, with a wider release via EMI in January 2011. It is composed of acoustic versions of Helix hits from albums past as well as a new cover version of &quot;Touch Of Magic&quot; by the late Canadian singer, James Leroy.[1] It is the first studio recording by the current Helix lineup of vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Brent Doerner and Kaleb Duck, bassist Daryl Gray and drummer Greg Hinz.[2] It also features guitar performances by ex-member and co-producer Sean Kelly.
