Essentially it was me and Joe playing a selection of some of the best music from unsigned bands who had uploaded their songs to the Coke Music website. You should still be able to download them from I-tunes (theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re free) or listen on the Coke website here.\\&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:515511c239fd5233ef32ff3c44723f79f87674a5","amp;dn":"Adam+and+Joe+Coke+New+Music+Podcast+1-13+%282006-2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"515511c239fd5233ef32ff3c44723f79f87674a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,85,17,194,57,253,82,51,239,50,255,60,68,114,63,121,248,118,116,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
