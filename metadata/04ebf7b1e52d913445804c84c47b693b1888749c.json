They will embark on a 12 day epic mission like no other. Only the courageous will survive this brutal expedition to the very end. They must trek over treacherous mountains, find and eat wild food, build shelter and make fire as they navigate their way to the coastline and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  Part 4 \r\nThe celebrities move from the African bush to the coastal forest, where they must learn how to adapt to their new surroundings. Bear surprises the survivors by revealing they are camped only 30 feet away from three elephants - but their delight turns to disgust when they learn their first task - how to extract drinking fluid from the animals' dung to ensure survival in dire situations. They are then tasked with their first mission - to cross a canyon with a thumping waterfall and strong fast flowing water. As they bed down later, the mood within camp is strained and arguments begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3138 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/mission-survive/251813-mission-survive-2016-cast-revealed-meet-celebrity-contestants.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04ebf7b1e52d913445804c84c47b693b1888749c","amp;dn":"Bear+Grylls+Mission+Survive+Series+2+4of6+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04ebf7b1e52d913445804c84c47b693b1888749c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,235,247,177,229,45,145,52,69,128,76,132,196,123,105,59,24,136,116,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
