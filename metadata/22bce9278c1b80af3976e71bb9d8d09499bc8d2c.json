It concerns a priest who gathers together a group of boys, both American and European, and takes them to a beach on the Mediterranean Sea. There he has plans to stage a play based on the biblical book of Genesis.\n\nThroughout the movie, the boys in question are frequently entirely nude and are shown frolicking in the surf, building shelters, driving a van and climbing up cliffs.\n\nOne national critic described the boysÃ‚Â´ anarchic revelry as a &quot;dream-like descent from civilization into the chaos reminiscent of Lord of the Flies.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://members.fortunecity.com/johnb53/g/GenesisChildren.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://members.fortunecity.com/johnb53/g/GenesisChildren.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0136217/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0136217/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English.
