Papathanassiou and Roussos had already been successful in Greece (playing in the bands Formynx and Idols respectively) while they got together with Sideras and Koulouris to form a new band","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beffaf3e4f60a20e3a7de3656f9277e5f2d8a3d8","amp;dn":"Aphrodite%5C%27s+Child+-+Best+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beffaf3e4f60a20e3a7de3656f9277e5f2d8a3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,255,175,62,79,96,162,14,58,125,227,101,111,146,119,229,242,216,163,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
