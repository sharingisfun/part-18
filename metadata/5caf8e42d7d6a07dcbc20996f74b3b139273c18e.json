Named after the 1960 short story &quot;The Day the Icicle Works Closed&quot; by science fiction author Frederik Pohl, The Icicle Works joined Liverpool's early 1980s 'neo-psychedelia' wave, which also propelled Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and The Teardrop Explodes to stardom. They are best known in their home country for their only top 20 UK hit &quot;Love Is A Wonderful Colour&quot; (1983). In the US and Canada, they also had only one top 40 hit, but it was the 1984 single &quot;Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)&quot;.\n\nLed by singer/songwriter Ian McNabb, the band released five albums from 1984 to 1990 before breaking up in 1991. \n\nThe Best Of the Icicle Works was released in 1992.\n\nRecorded\n1992\n\nGenre\nRock\n\nLabel\nBeggars Banquet\n\nFormat\nFLAC\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 Hollow Horse (long version) 4:58 \n02 Love Is a Wonderful Colour 4:11 \n03 Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream) 3:48 \n04 Understanding Jane ('92 version) 3:26 \n05 Shit Creek 4:02 \n06 High Time (acoustic) 3:35 \n07 Who Do You Want for Your Love? 3:56 \n08 Evangeline 4:05 \n09 Little Girl Lost 4:35 \n10 When It All Comes Down ('92 version) 5:47 \n11 Starry Blue Eyed Wonder 4:13 \n12 Out of Season 4:44 \n13 The Kiss Off 4:19 \n14 Up Here in the North of England 5:12 \n15 Firepower 3:44 \n16 Blind 5:21 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5caf8e42d7d6a07dcbc20996f74b3b139273c18e","amp;dn":"The+Icicle+Works+-+The+Best+Of+FLAC+-+Cue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5caf8e42d7d6a07dcbc20996f74b3b139273c18e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,175,142,66,215,214,160,125,203,194,9,150,247,75,59,19,146,115,193,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
