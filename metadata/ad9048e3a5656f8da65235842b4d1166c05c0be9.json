Each disc is devoted to one of GaumontÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s artistic directors, who oversaw all film production at the studio, and profoundly influenced not only the identity of the studio but also the evolution of the cinema itself. \n\n\n\nDVD 1 Alice Guy \n\nFew individual artists have exerted as profound an influence upon the evolution of cinema as Alice Guy (later known as Guy-BlachÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©). With this collection of more than 60 films, culled from the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading archives and carefully mastered, Guy may no longer be seen as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwoman filmmaker.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ These films, produced by Guy for Gaumont before she moved to the US, reveal her to be an unqualified pioneer whose work stands alongside that of the LumiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re Brothers, Georges MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©liÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s, and Edwin S. Porter, in cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rapid growth from an optical illusion to a storytelling medium to an art form. Among the highlights are a 19th-century serpentine dance, early ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtrickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ films, experiments with hand-coloring and synchronized sound, comedies, social commentaries, and (as the collectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s centerpiece) a 33-minute religious epic: The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ (1906). \n\nScreenshots: http://freakyflicks.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=4466\n\n\n1897 \nThe Fisherman at the Stream \nBathing in a Stream \nSerpentine Dance by Mme.
