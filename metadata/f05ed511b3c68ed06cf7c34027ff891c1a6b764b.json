The aim of this new revolution is to develop a Ã¢â‚¬Å“theory of everythingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€ -- a set of laws of physics that will explain all that can be explained, ranging from the tiniest subatomic particle to the universe as a whole. Here, readers will learn the ideas behind the theories, and their effects upon our world, our civilization, and ourselves.
