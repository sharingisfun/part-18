It is a conglomeration of their famous improvisational segments &quot;Drums&quot; and &quot;Space.&quot;\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the second set of a Grateful Dead concert came a period of musical improvisation. This part of the concert is commonly referred to as &quot;Space,&quot; and came right after a drum solo or duet. Infrared Roses is a compilation of these performances. There are no recognizable songs from the band&amp;#039;s repertoire on this release. Robert Hunter, probably best known for his numerous collaborations with the Grateful Dead, created the names of the tracks for the album.\n\nFrom wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_Roses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_Roses&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04cda8c28b12a83cfdf546f04a992ec82ed07e7","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1991+-+Infrared+Roses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04cda8c28b12a83cfdf546f04a992ec82ed07e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,76,218,140,40,177,42,131,207,223,84,111,4,169,146,236,130,237,7,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
