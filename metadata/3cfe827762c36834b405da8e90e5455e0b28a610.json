Even if you're in the &quot;perfect relationship&quot;, chances are, you've probably said (or even just fleetingly thought) &quot;I'm going to kill my husband!&quot;. So what separates those of us who do, from those who don't? Why can some women cope with the everyday - or even not-so-everyday - stresses of married life without ever resorting to violence, while others &quot;snap&quot; and murder their mates?\r\n\r\nSnapped aims to answer this very question: what causes a woman to kill her mate? Each episode of Snapped chronicles a different female felon, striving to pinpoint the very moment at which she, well, &quot;snapped&quot; -- slaying the man in her life.\r\n\r\nWhile all of Snapped's subjects have murder in common, their backgrounds are exceptionally diverse. From millionaire brides with everything to lose, to small-town sweethearts who should simply know better, these shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, conclusively proving that there's often something far more sinister to the fairer sex than &quot;sugar and spice and everything nice.&quot; \r\n\r\nEp 1 - Amanda Kaur\r\nEp 2 - Ruby Ann Ruffolo\r\nEp 3 - Dee Dee Moore\r\nEp 4 - Donna Cobb\r\nEp 5 - Melissa Cole\r\nEp 6 - Katey Passaniti\r\nEp 7 - Laurie Jean Cone\r\nEp 8 - Lateisha Jandreau\r\nEp 9 - Jodi Arias-Part 1\r\nEp 10 - Jodi Arias-Part 2\r\nEp 11 - Dawn Silvernail\r\nEp 12 - Karen Newell\r\nEp 13 - Jackie Postma","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cfe827762c36834b405da8e90e5455e0b28a610","amp;dn":"Snapped+-+Season+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cfe827762c36834b405da8e90e5455e0b28a610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,254,130,119,98,195,104,52,180,5,218,142,144,229,69,94,11,40,166,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
