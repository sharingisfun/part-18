As of 2012, the group has released 18 original studio albums, several EPs and compilations, and over 30 singles. Outside Japan, they are best known as the group responsible for the soundtrack to the FLCL OVA series.\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite records from The Pillows. There are so many great tracks on this one, so i'm sharing it with you. If you can bleed, you can seed. \n\nSBTTF (Shine brighter then the first)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37bf6728426b40eefc136b3baaffc05f37f2f9e7","amp;dn":"The+Pillows+-+Little+Busters+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37bf6728426b40eefc136b3baaffc05f37f2f9e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,191,103,40,66,107,64,238,252,19,107,59,170,255,192,95,55,242,249,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
