(updated 02-04-2015 - Version 1.5.2)\n\n1.5 to 1.5.2 update : Gamebasev13 dats &amp; screenshots for ViceX ) . \nFixed 'FatX limit' issues. Some clean-up and small fixes.\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhat's new from 0.9 :\n\n- Almost ALL boxart has been redone / retouched from the previous release. It's now fully 'HD-Ready' (for Xbox), \n  and for other (future) systems the Box-art is of a far higher resolution even (not included in Xbox pack).  \n  A HUGE amount of time has gone making this, but the art sure looks good now :) \n  \n- Heavily updated Game-info\n- Updated Game Configurations.\n- About 800 new and updated Titles (with configs)\n- Updated Previews\n- Updated Scene-Demo Selection\n\nThis pack consists of :\n\n- 4750 Commodore 64 Titles ;  'Handpicked' , tested, and the best and / or latest versions from groups like Nostalgia, Remember and Laxity.\n  All Unzipped (so highscores will work) &amp; renamed.\n- When needed Game Images were changed to include extras or extra versions of a game. \n- 278 Previews\n- Scene-Demo Selection  (285)\n\n\n- Boxart in High quality!  ( Much Higher HD resolution versions, for faster systems,  are also available (not included in Xbox pack) );  (Re)Remastered and Retouched\n (A huge amount of work has gone into this; quite some Boxart is (was!) very old / obscure and ugly. \n- Newly made Action and Title shots. (Existing ones were often in the wrong colours, missing borders or simply very boring).\n- Manuals &amp; Maps\n- Game Info\n\n\n\n\n- Game configurations!!  All games will load out-of-the-(X)box , no messing around with drive settings etc.   \n  \n\n- All games have their own unique controller settings!  \n\n  So 'Cybernoid' will have weapons mapped under the controller, 'Renegade' won't need the keyboard anymore etc.\n  Ofcourse heavy RPG's and text heavy adventures will need the virtual Keyboard (or xbox keyboard). \n  However, certain RPGs or Arcade-FlightSims like 'Ace 2' or 'Infiltrator' DO have mappings!\n\n\n\n\n- Latest Vice64X  (v10b4) + updated Synopsis  (Thanks Madmab!) ---&gt; Vice64X version in Pack includes updated Synopis! be sure to overwrite any previous!\n\nThis is a complete Out-of-the-Box Commodore 64 experience on Xbox! With all configurations etc. there is nothing like this on ANY system as far as I know. Something I always wanted to have myself. A lot of work , but enjoyed making it. \nFuture updates will follow as new games still come out on the old Breadbox! (it's life spans from 1982 to roughly 1994 and beyond as it seems!). Also updates on Xtras like Media, Boxart backs, Gameplay Movies (Thanks to Waal for taking on this impossible task!).\n\n\nFor questions and updates on the latest Emu's and Xtras go to Emuxtras.net\n\n\nENJOY!\n\n\n\nAsphodel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d6e14c7b7eaca927c31d835757ae718569585ff","amp;dn":"Commodore+64+EmuXtras+1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d6e14c7b7eaca927c31d835757ae718569585ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,110,20,199,183,234,202,146,124,49,216,53,117,122,231,24,86,149,133,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
