It was reissued on May 8, 2007 under Caroline Records. They played the odd gig at The Viper Room, of which Depp used to be co-owner. One of these gigs was played on October 30, 1993, where the lineup included Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Haynes, along with other members of the line-up that night, was a good friend of actor River Phoenix. While the band were in the middle of their song &quot;Michael Stipe&quot;, which includes the lines &quot;I'm glad I met old Michael Stipe, I didn't get to see his car. Him and River Phoenix were leaving on the road tomorrow&quot; and &quot;but we didn't have a part, not a piece of our heart, not Michael, River Phoenix or Flea or me.&quot; Phoenix (unbeknownst to the band at the time) was outside the venue having seizures on the sidewalk.[2] Phoenix died in the early hours of October 31 of heart failure brought on by an overdose of cocaine and heroin.&quot;\n\nTrack listing\nNo. \t\tTitle \t\t\t \tLength\n1. \t\t&quot;I Save Cigarette Butts&quot;    \t3:43\n2. \t\t&quot;Zing Splash&quot;   \t \t3:16\n3. \t\t&quot;Michael Stipe&quot;   \t \t4:25\n4. \t\t&quot;Oklahoma&quot;   \t\t\t3:38\n5. \t\t&quot;Dancing Queen&quot;   \t \t3:47\n6. \t\t&quot;Jon Glenn&quot; (Mega Mix) \t \t9:00\n7. \t\t&quot;Mr. Officer&quot;   \t \t3:43\n8. \t\t&quot;White Man Sings the Blues&quot;  \t6:40\n9. \t\t&quot;Die Anne&quot;   \t\t\t4:43\n10. \t\t&quot;Scrapings from Ring&quot;    \t7:51\n11. \t\t&quot;The Deal&quot;   \t\t \t6:17\n\n\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.
