Holland.\n\n \nLive From Nowhere In Particular\n \nJoe Bonamassa will release a double CD-set entitled Live From Nowhere In Particular on August 19, 2008. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fire and fervor in the music and in the persona of guitarist Joe Bonamassa and although his studio albums have been nothing less than exceptional, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no better way than the live performance atmosphere to demonstrate just how mesmerizing this amazing guitarist/vocalist can actually be. He's truly a fiery vocalist as well, a trait that has a lot to do with his popularity, and he belts out the lyrics with resolute passion and vigor. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a well-rounded musician in every way. \nAnyone familiar with Joe Bonamassa knows the degree of respect and admiration he has for the music of yesteryear, primarily blues and rock. His renditions of the classics, such as TullÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA New Day Yesterday,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ YesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStarship Trooper,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Alvin LeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne Of These Days,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ adds smiles of approval to the faces of attentive audiences the world over. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a crucial key to his amazing talent: fans feel that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re listening to one of their peers, someone who feels the same passion for the music. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s similar to the best friend you had growing up, the guy next door youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d drink beers with on Sunday afternoons while listening to vinyl records. Perhaps without even realizing the musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classic relevance at that time, you related to it in a personal and private way.\n\nA trait that never ceases to surface in his live sets, Joe pays homage to his idols and influences. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll often throw a classic lick into a song, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s often done with the same passion, phrasing, and tone of the initial recording. His influences are many; they are legion, one might say; from one end of the rock spectrum to the other, blues as well. However, the honor he bestows upon musicians of the past and present is a humble endeavor of appreciation, additives to accentuate a style thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original and creative on its own. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all Joe Bonamassa, and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a tonal mastermind of the instrument. Nevertheless, he likes to toss something into the mix every now and then, just to remind listeners where it all came from. Live From Nowhere In Particular is all that and more. \n\nThe barnstorming opener, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBridge To Better Days,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as well as the astounding acoustic blues, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWoke Up Dreaming,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are both exemplary of the originality thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Joe Bonamassa, and of the passion he exerts in the live setting. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incredibly adept at both electric and acoustic guitar, and this live set authenticates that. Covers of FreeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk in My Shadows,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Paul MarshallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo Many RoadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and Warren HaynesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf Heartaches Were NickelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are brilliantly executed. The Blues Foundation board member puts pure emotion and sincerity into the blues. Listen to the little Beatles insert at the end of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf Heartaches Were Nickles.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s merely one example of the fun he has with melodies, empowered by an imagination that segues tastefully from one area into another.\n\n* * *\nListen to &quot;Bridge To Better Days&quot; from Live From Nowhere In Particular\n\n\n\n\n* * *\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWoke Up DreamingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an absolute killer song. Those who have seen Joe perform it live know it to be true. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a mesmerizing and exhilarating jaunt amid acoustic prowess and fingerboard dexterity, coerced along by raw passion and unadulterated intensity. The eighteen minute voyage through ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDjango/Just Got PaidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a dreamy excursion through Guitar Paradise. Similar to a good movie with a theme of mystery and intrigue, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll leave out the potpourri of influences heard in this one as to not be the spoiler. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s totally amazing. Utilizing an adroit talent for slide and fretboard wizardry, Joe soars off in sonic mounts and diving plummets in the ten minute ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIndia/Mountain Time.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ His performance is incredibly beautiful and melodic throughout each and every divergent course and alteration. He ends the set with an incredible combo cover of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA New Day YesterdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStarship Trooper.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nI believe wholeheartedly that it takes a great band to complete a great performance, and although Joe is phenomenal throughout, he once again has a brilliant group of guys backing him up here. With Carmine Rojas on bass, Rick Melick on keyboards, and Bogie Bowles on drums, Joe Bonamassa excels in Live From Nowhere In Particular, proving heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the most exciting guitarists and performers on the scene today. This is an excellent live album. \n\nLive From Nowhere In Particular\n\nDisc One:\n1. Bridge To Better Days\n2. Walk In My Shadows\n3. So Many Roads\n4. India/Mountain Time\n5. Another Kinda Love\n6.
