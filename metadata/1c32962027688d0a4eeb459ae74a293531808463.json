Review &quot;ORIGINS is comprehensive, allows a professor to be selective, and reflects new research.&quot; &quot;It remains the best choice for my students.&quot; &quot; . . . provides the greatest coverage of periods . . . presents the elements of language . . . in an approach which trims down the entire period but leaves enough of the linguistic elements for students to be able to understand how language actually does change.&quot; &quot;The [companion book of problems] is one of the textbook's greatest strengths because it allows students to put into practice the principles that are presented. The exercises help to complete learning that starts with the readings in the textbook.&quot; &quot;This relatively slim volume is attractive and accessible for undergraduate and graduate students, has so much information, and could serve even as a reference source.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c32962027688d0a4eeb459ae74a293531808463","amp;dn":"The+Origins+and+Development+of+the+English+Language+%5BNon-Fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c32962027688d0a4eeb459ae74a293531808463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,50,150,32,39,104,141,10,78,235,69,154,231,74,41,53,49,128,132,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
