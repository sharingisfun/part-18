Occasionally, the bilingual Soriano (a native of New Jersey) sings and raps in Spanish, although the vast majority of Nonpoint's lyrics are in English. Goldman and KB, meanwhile, are ex-members of a South Florida band called Fuse. (The name Nonpoint is derived from Nonpoint Factor, the name of an outfit that the New York-born Rivera led in Puerto Rico before moving to South Florida.)\n\nNonpoint's first album, Separate Yourself, was released independently in 1997 and was followed by 1999's Struggle on Jugular and 2000's Statement on MCA. After several tours with artists like Sevendust, Linkin Park, and Staind, the band stepped back into the studio and returned in the summer of 2002 with Development. Nonpoint spent the following year touring extensively, most notably making an appearance at Ozzfest. They released Recoil in 2004, a 13-track collection of streamlined power that included a cover of Phil Collins' &quot;In the Air Tonight.&quot;\n\nNONPOINT will release its eighth studio album, &quot;The Return&quot;, on September 30 via Razor &amp; Tie (one day earlier internationally via Metal Blade Records).\n\nAfter 17 years in the game, the Florida quintet sustains the same energy that sparked its foundation back in 1997. The riffs crack with intensity, the bass and drums forge an unmatched groove, and the vocals rapidly recount stories of pain and perseverance. &quot;The Return&quot; remains as raw, ripping, and real as these musicians Ã¢â‚¬â€ Elias Soriano (vocals), Robb Rivera (drums), Rasheed Thomas (guitar), Adam Woloszyn (bass), and B.C. Kochmit (guitar) Ã¢â‚¬â€ get.\n\nIn February 2014, NONPOINT entered Groovemaster Studios with Grammy Award-nominated producer Johnny K (DISTURBED, STAIND, MEGADETH) and engineer Daniel Salcidoto. It marked their second collaboration together, and this time, the band had already amassed an arsenal of tight and tough material. Soriano elaborates: &quot;Last record, we stepped in a direction we've wanted to for years and our fans revered us for it. This record we have gotten up to speed and dropped the pedal to the floor.\n\n&quot;I think our fans will embrace this record in a way no other NONPOINT record has been viewed or loved. We left no room for question of what we are trying to accomplish with our music or who we are. We haven't gone back to old school. We didn't reflect on our past. We didn't discuss what works. We are not 'Statement' NONPOINT or even 'Bullet' NONPOINT... 'The Return' is NONPOINT right the fuck now.&quot;\n\nAdds Rivera: &quot;Johnny is like the sixth member of our band at this point! He works us, and he pulls no punches. It was such a natural thing that we only needed to track for three weeks. Johnny understands the band and what we are, and he encourages us to be ourselves.&quot;\n\nElias explains the meaning behind the first single, &quot;Breaking Skin&quot;: &quot;It's about addiction, whether it be food, drugs, sex, lying, or anything, that tends to turn into an itch. You can't stop scratching it so you break skin. Then, you're bleeding. You need to get help at that point and deal with it.&quot;\n\nRobb adds: &quot;'Breaking Skin' is a different kind of song for us. There's a lot of melody, but it's still so heavy. That heaviness has always been in the back of our minds. It's a natural direction for us. Most bands soften their sound as they go on. We get more aggressive and heavy. That's what NONPOINT does best.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, the record opens up with the taut thrashing of &quot;Pins And Needles&quot;, which Elias describes as &quot;That moment where you say something very candid to an opposing party, and you know you're going to get a reaction. You only want to retaliate, waiting to pounce.&quot;\n\n&quot;Razors&quot; cuts deep with a bludgeoning and brutal stomp, and the title track captures a strong and rather crucial message for the singer. He continues, &quot;When you look back in your past, you always will find people who didn't believe in what you were doing at the beginning. They end up coming around full circle later. Watching them come back is an interesting feeling. You can be a dick about it, or you can just be happy and live your life. That song is about opening the door and holding the proverbial slice of crow for them to eat high above your head.&quot;\n\nUltimately, NONPOINT once again delivers a cohesive collection of powerful songs. &quot;I want everybody to feel like they got a complete record from beginning to end,&quot; concludes Elias. &quot;I want them to walk away with something substantial and true that they can hopefully come back to.&quot;\n\nRobb leaves off: &quot;NONPOINT has always been known for writing songs that help people. If we can help even one person feel better about his or her day, we've done well, as far as I'm concerned. I hope everybody gets something positive and can walk away with a smile.&quot;\n\n\nDiscography:\nStruggle   [1999]\nStatement    [2000]\nDevelopment    [2002]\nRecoil    [2004]\nTo the Pain    [2005]\nLive and Kicking    [2006]\nVengeance    [2007]\nMiracle    [2010]\nNonpoint    [2012]\nThe Return    [2014]\n\n\nPresent Line-Up:\nElias Soriano(vocals)\nRobb Rivera(drums)\nRasheed Thomas (guitar)\nAdam Woloszyn (bass)\nB.C.
