Mike Baron, Steve Englehart, Mike Mignola, John and Marie Severin, Val Mayerik, Mark Wheatley, Al Williamson, Bill Mantlo, Steve Bissette and John Bolton collaborated on this project, aptly entitled 'Amazing High Adventure'. The goal, in the words of editor Carl Potts, was to publish &quot;...an anthology of stories that take place in times and settings not seen in our medium anymore.&quot;\n\nAnd so they did. And here it is.\n\nThanks to the creative teams and the scanners!
