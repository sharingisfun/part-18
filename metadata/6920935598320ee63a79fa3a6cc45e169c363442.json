In The First Rule of Ten, the first installment in a three-book detective series, we meet this spiritual warrior who is singularly equipped, if not occasionally ill-equipped, as he takes on his first case as a private investigator in Los Angeles.\n\nGrowing up in a Tibetan Monastery, Ten dreamed of becoming a modern-day Sherlock Holmes. So when he was sent to Los Angeles to teach meditation, he joined the LAPD instead. But as the Buddha says, change is inevitable; and ten years later, everything is about to changeÃ¢â‚¬â€big-timeÃ¢â‚¬â€for Ten. One resignation from the police force, two bullet-wounds, three suspicious deaths, and a beautiful woman later, he quickly learns that whenever he breaks his first rule, mayhem follows.\n\n2/ The Second Rule of Ten\n\n'Beware your old, limited models of thinking: no matter how safe they make you feel, eventually you will become their prisoner.' That's the second rule of Ten.\nTenzing 'Ten' Norbu - ex-monk and ex-cop - is back! In The Second Rule of Ten, the next book in the Dharma Detective series, our daring detective faces a dead Hollywood producer, an ailing philanthropist's missing sister, and a way-too-sexy pathologist, who are all wreaking havoc with his serenity - and that's before the arrival of cartel king and arch-nemesis Chaco Morales. \n\nAs Ten moves deeper into the case, things get personal when his two best friends in Dharamshala go missing, and his former LAPD partner, Bill, turns oddly distant. Ten's journey for the truth propels him from gang-ridden, dangerous Boyle Heights in east LA to Lhasa, Tibet, and back again. He must wrestle with more than one limiting thought and inner enemy if he is to identify, much less overcome, his rapidly multiplying outer ones. The clues to solving this complex cluster of mysterious events are sprinkled all over the City of Angels, but the ultimate answers, as always for Ten, lie inside.\n\n3/ The Third Rule of Ten\n\nIt was all going so smoothly for ex-Buddhist monk and current private eye, Tenzing Norbu. His clients are finally paying, his pathologist girlfriend is a dream and even his cat is finally behaving himself. \n\nBut Ten knows that trouble is only one move away when an old adversary resurfaces, leading him down a dangerous path littered with bodies, untraceable prescription drugs and human organ trafficking. With the death of his father looming over him, Ten's got a full case load in his third explosive outing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6920935598320ee63a79fa3a6cc45e169c363442","amp;dn":"Tenzig+Norbu+Series+by+Gay+Hendricks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6920935598320ee63a79fa3a6cc45e169c363442","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,32,147,85,152,50,14,230,58,121,250,58,108,196,94,22,156,54,52,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
