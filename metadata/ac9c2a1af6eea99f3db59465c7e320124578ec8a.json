I'm Casey Kasem, this is AT40, and the countdown continues on the way to the top.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a group with a member who kept his daytime welding job even after the group's first single became a million-seller. He finally quit welding after the group's second hit was well into the top 40.\n\nA listener wants to know if any white artists have ever hit number one on the soul chart. Casey says it's only happened 23 times, four by The King himself.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;During the rock era, how many recordings by foreign artists hit number one and who had the second most?&quot; Casey says 34 different foreign recording acts have hit the number one spot on the American chart a total of 62 times, and then gives the details on the rest of the question.\n\nIn another Dear Casey letter, &quot;What artist has had the most total weeks at number one, counting all his records?&quot; Casey says that even without counting all his records, he is still number one with 80 weeks at number one!\n\nYet another listener wants to know if a song sung entirely in a foreign language has ever become number one. Casey says three times, and tells about each one.\n\n40:    Neither Of Us (Wants To Say Goodbye) - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n39:    Superfly - Curtis Mayfield\n38:    Hummingbird - Seals &amp; Crofts            \n37:    Jesus Is Just Alright - The Doobie Brothers\n36:    Aubrey - Bread\n35:    Danny's Song - Anne Murray\n34:    Big City Miss Ruth Ann - Gallery\n33:    Harry Hippie - Bobby Womack &amp; Peace\n32:    Living Together Growing Together - 5th Dimension\n31:    Me And Mrs. Jones - Billy Paul\n30:    I Got Ants In My Pants - James Brown\n29:    Peaceful Easy Feeling - The Eagles\n28:    I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band) - The Moody Blues\n27:    Reelin' And Rockin' - Chuck Berry        \n26:    You Turn Me On, I'm A Radio - Joni Mitchell\n25:    Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001) - Deodato\n24:    Hi Hi Hi - Wings\n23:    Dreidel - Don Mclean\n22:    Do You Want To Dance - Bette Midler\n21:    Your Mama Don't Dance - Ken Loggins &amp; Jim Messina\n20:    Love Jones - Brighter Side Of Darkness\n19:    The Cover Of The Rolling Stone - Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show\n18:    Jambalaya (On The Bayou) - Blue Ridge Rangers\n17:    Trouble Man - Marvin Gaye\n16:    Daddy's Home - Jermaine Jackson\n15:    Love Train - The O'Jay's\n14:    Dancing In The Moonlight - King Harvest\n13:    Last Song - Edward Bear\n12:    Superstition - Stevie Wonder\n11:    The World Is A Ghetto - War\n10:    Rocky Mountain High - John Denver\n9:    Why Can't We Live Together - Timmy Thomas\n8:    Don't Expect Me To Be Your Friend - Lobo\n7:    Could It Be I'm Falling In Love - The Spinners\n6:    Do It Again - Steely Dan\n5:    Killing Me Softly With His Song - Roberta Flack\n4:    Dueling Banjos - Deliverance (Eric Weisberg)\n3:    Oh Babe, What Would You Say - Hurricane Smith\n2:    You're So Vain - Carly Simon\n1:    Crocodile Rock - Elton John","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac9c2a1af6eea99f3db59465c7e320124578ec8a","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1973_February_17th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac9c2a1af6eea99f3db59465c7e320124578ec8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,156,42,26,246,238,169,159,61,181,148,101,199,227,32,18,69,120,236,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
