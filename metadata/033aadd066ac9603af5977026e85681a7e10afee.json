Fred is a historian researching the Allied landings, Maggie enjoys charity work, and their kids are looking forward to meeting other teenagers at the local lycÃƒÂ©e. Or so it seems.\n\nIn fact, Fred is really Giovanni Manzoni, an ex-goodfella turned stool pigeon whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been relocated from New Jersey to France by the FBIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s witness protection program. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a two-million-dollar bounty on his head, but he and his family canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help attracting attention (imagine the Sopranos in Normandy). And when imprisoned mobster Don Mimino gets wind of their location, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mafia mayhem ÃƒÂ  la Josh BazellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Beat the Reaper, or like The Godfather as if written by Carl Hiaasen. Because while you can take the man out of the Mafia, you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take the Mafia out of the man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033aadd066ac9603af5977026e85681a7e10afee","amp;dn":"The+Family+%28Deluxe+Edition%29-+Tonino+Benacquista+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033aadd066ac9603af5977026e85681a7e10afee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,58,173,208,102,172,150,3,175,89,119,2,110,133,104,26,126,16,175,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
