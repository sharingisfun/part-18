The band are often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[1] Despite this, Lemmy has always dubbed their music as simply &quot;rock and roll&quot;.\n\nTo date, MotÃƒÂ¶rhead have released twenty-one studio albums, ten live recordings, twelve compilation albums and five EPs. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented MotÃƒÂ¶rhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. As of 2012, MotÃƒÂ¶rhead have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.\n\nMotÃƒÂ¶rhead are typically classified as heavy metal, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name &quot;MotÃƒÂ¶rhead&quot; is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the MotÃƒÂ¶rhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as &quot;War-Pig&quot;and &quot;Snaggletooth&quot;. The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d768d87ed3423c273ccbdcd20850bec6b2b81f6","amp;dn":"Motorhead+18+Albums+Vinyl+24-96+1977-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d768d87ed3423c273ccbdcd20850bec6b2b81f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,118,141,135,237,52,35,194,115,204,189,205,32,133,11,236,107,43,129,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
