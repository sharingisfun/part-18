Her father is a suspect in an armed robbery and is taken into custody. To escape the harsh realities of her life, she writes in her diary stories of an alter-ego: an adult version of herself who is a superhero known as Ant.\n\nVolume two, published by Image Comics lasted for 11 issues. An adult Hannah Washington wakes up in a mental institution, where she's been told all her memories are the result of a coping mechanism described as a &quot;juvenile power fantasy.&quot; But, little by little, her fantasies of her life as Ant become more and more real.\n\nAnt: Unleashed is the third volume of the series, released in 2008 by Big City Comics. This run focuses on a more mature version of Ant. Six issues were scheduled but only the first three have been published, later issues being cancelled without a resolution to the story.\n\nThe creator and artist Mario Gully has stated that the concept of Ant was created while he was incarcerated in 1996 for attempted armed robbery. Gully says that one day he was looking through a barred cell window and a tiny ant crawled in from the outside. He later vowed to change his life and make something out of himself. He then created &quot;ANT&quot;.\n\nDue to scenes of nudity and sex this comes with an ADULT rating.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f95dc6df95e4d63e541100392ea57dbbe9a924","amp;dn":"Ant+%5BADULT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f95dc6df95e4d63e541100392ea57dbbe9a924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,249,93,198,223,149,228,214,62,84,17,0,57,46,165,125,187,233,169,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
