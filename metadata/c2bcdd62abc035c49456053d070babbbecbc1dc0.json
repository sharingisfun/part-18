This book contains all of the chapters plus recipes and a book preview.\n\nIn the sequel to the best-selling book, Amish Circle Letters, Mary Ruth adapts to her new role as wife and mother while Mimi realizes that life as a farmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife is more difficult than she expected. Melvin and KatieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friendship blossoms into something more with dire consequences for the family.\n\nAs Amish do not use computers or cell phones to communicate, Amish women will often write circle letters, letters that they send to a list of addresses of people that they would like to include in the correspondence. Since they do not have access to photocopiers, the first person on the list will receive the letter, read it, and respond. That person sends both the first letter and their response to the second name on the list. This continues until the entire package of letters goes full-circle, returning to the original sender.\n\nAn Amish Christian Romance that will leave you breathless and wanting more. Sarah Price, bestselling author of Amish Christian Romances, brings her twenty-five years of experience living among the Amish and from growing up Mennonite to the pages of her novels and novellas, in order to present a truly authentic Amish experience just for her readers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2bcdd62abc035c49456053d070babbbecbc1dc0","amp;dn":"Amish+Circle+Letters+II+-+Sarah+Price","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2bcdd62abc035c49456053d070babbbecbc1dc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,188,221,98,171,192,53,196,148,86,5,61,7,11,171,187,236,188,29,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
