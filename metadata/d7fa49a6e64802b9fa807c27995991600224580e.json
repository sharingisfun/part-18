It was the only three that Giraud drew.\n\nA prequel dealing with Blueberrys early years, during the American Civil War, how the racist son of a wealthy plantation owner turned into a Yankee bugler and all the adventures after that. The material for the first few albums were first seen in digest size Super Pocket Pilote during the late sixties. Later these were blown up, rearranged, colored, to fit the album format. Some panels were omitted in the process. The 1990 English language edition of these stories, by Catalan Communications under their Comcat line, give track of the changes and present the left out panels. Only the first three stories were published in English, although the company planned to publish The Missouri Demons and Terror over Kansas, as can be seen on the back covers of the ones published. The three albums were also published in a single hardcover version.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/1703/yb1p00.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/1703/yb1p00.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3937/yb1p43.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3937/yb1p43.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/4412/yb200.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/4412/yb200.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/4576/yb232.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/4576/yb232.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/9659/yb300.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/9659/yb300.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/6070/yb319.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/6070/yb319.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7fa49a6e64802b9fa807c27995991600224580e","amp;dn":"Young+Blueberry+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7fa49a6e64802b9fa807c27995991600224580e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,250,73,166,230,72,2,185,250,128,124,39,153,89,145,96,2,36,88,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
