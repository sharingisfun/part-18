Father Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott) is trying to deal with his wife's rejection after he has an affair with a student, and soon falls under the house's sway. Meanwhile, wife Vivien (Connie Britton) must not only try to forgive her husband but deal with the aftereffects of a miscarriage. Daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) is confronted with hostile girls at her new school and befriends her father's disturbed teenage patient, Tate Langdon (Evan Peters).

Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) administers the facility with a strict hand while concealing her lusts. Dr. Arthur Arden (James Cromwell) conducts strange experiments on the patients, including accused serial killer Kit Walker (Evan Peters), the infamous Bloody Face, who may or may not be innocent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80e998611a5ac26faf86e126a06565834d5d7aca","amp;dn":"American.Horror.Story.S03E04.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80e998611a5ac26faf86e126a06565834d5d7aca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,233,152,97,26,90,194,111,175,134,225,38,160,101,101,131,77,93,122,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
