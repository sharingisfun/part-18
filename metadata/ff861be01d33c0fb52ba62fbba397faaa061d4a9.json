TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made the best of things, planting food, drinking their way through the cellarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wine and ale, and reminiscing about the way life used to be. But with supplies running thin, everything is about to change. The arrival of a stranger named Michael sheds new light on their circumstances. If the survivors can reach Cornwall, a few days' journey north, they will find a safe haven, called Bar None, quite possibly the last bar on earth!\n\nFace by Tim Lebbon \nA family picks up a hitchhiker in the worst blizzard in living memory. It's a mistake. Brand is not who he seems, to the mother, the father or the daughter. He is something more, something they fear in their own ways, and soon after the thaw they are all seeing him again. They begin to learn things about themselves, and each other, which perhaps would be best left unknown. And they begin to realise other, more painful truths ... love blinds . Fear distorts . Hate misleads.\n\nUntil She Sleeps by Tim Lebbon\n300 years ago, a white witch who absorbed the nightmares of others was buried alive in a tomb under the church. After accidentally being discovered, the nightmares are starting to come true and the killing has begun.\nIt's up to 13-year-old Andy to stop her before she destroys the town.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff861be01d33c0fb52ba62fbba397faaa061d4a9","amp;dn":"Brian+Stableford+3+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff861be01d33c0fb52ba62fbba397faaa061d4a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,134,27,224,29,51,192,251,82,186,98,251,186,57,127,170,160,97,212,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
