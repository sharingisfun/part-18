Rather than deal with werewolf politics, they decide to head out and find a home elsewhere. Along the way they encounter Dean, a hitchhiker hoping to thumb a ride to a new life. The chance encounter leads to much more between the stranger and Ryder.\n\nWhen Spencer and Luc walk in on them in a compromising position, Spencer fears he's lost the first man he's ever loved. But Spencer has a secret. Will Luc stay with him once he discovers the truth or will he end up alone in his new home?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:152cfbe184ba73fec317d4c8241fa558138d50f3","amp;dn":"Spencer%26rsquo%3Bs+Secret+Wolf+Harem%2C+Book+2+by+Joyee+Flynn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"152cfbe184ba73fec317d4c8241fa558138d50f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,44,251,225,132,186,115,254,195,23,212,200,36,31,165,88,19,141,80,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
