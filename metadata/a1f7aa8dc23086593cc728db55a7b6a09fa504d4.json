And Tracy Chapman is firmly within the classic singer/songwriter tradition, sounding for all the world as if it was recorded in the early '70s -- that is, if all you paid attention to were the sonics, since Chapman's songs are clearly a result of the Reagan revolution. Even the love songs and laments are underscored by a realized vision of trickle-down modern life -- listen to the lyrical details of &quot;Fast Car&quot; for proof. Chapman's impassioned liberal activism and emotional resonance enlivens her music, breathing life into her songs even when the production is a little bit too clean. Still, the juxtaposition of contemporary themes and classic production precisely is what makes the album distinctive -- it brings the traditions into the present. At the time, it revitalized traditional folk ideals of social activism and the like, kick starting the PC revolution in the process, but if those were its only merits, Tracy Chapman would sound dated. The record continues to sound fresh because Chapman's writing is so keenly observed and her strong, gutsy singing makes each song sound intimate and immediate.\n \n5/5 allmusicguide\n\nTracklist:\nA1 Talkin' Bout A Revolution 2:38\nA2 Fast Car 4:58\nA3 Across The Lines 3:22 \nA4 Behind The Wall 1:46 \nA5 Baby Can I Hold You 3:16 \nB1 Mountains O' Things 4:37\nB2 She's Got Her Ticket 3:54 \nB3 Why? 2:01 \nB4 For My Lover 3:15\nB5 If Not Now... 2:55\nB6 For You 3:09\n \nTech\nVacuum cleaned LP - Shure M97xE - Dual CS 505-3 - Handcrafted low capacitance custom cables, teflon insulated &amp; silver-plated coaxial conductors - Kenwood C1 Custom Revision I  \n\nDetails:\n- Phono Stage input capacitors replaced by Polypropylen/Styroflex types\n- All electrolytic capacitors in signal chain replaced by foil capacitors\n- Electrolytic capacitors not mounted by manufacturer onto the RIAA stage power Supply refitted (Philips NOS types)\n- Old JRC OpAmps replaced by Burr Brown and Analog Devices OpAmps resp.\nHandcrafted low capacitance custom cables, polyethylene insulated twinaxial conductors &gt; Audiotrak Prodigy 7.1 HiFi w/ AD712 OpAmps @ 24/96 &gt; HDD\n \nWavelab 6.11 (Waves XHum, Algorithmix Pro)\nAdobe Audition 3\nClickRepair 3/0\nTrader's Little Helper (FLAC)\nIzotope Rx Advanced 1.21\nResampled:\n-Ultra Steep, linear phase\nDithered:\n-MBIT+ Medium\n-Noise shaping light\n-Dither amount normal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1f7aa8dc23086593cc728db55a7b6a09fa504d4","amp;dn":"Tracy+Chapman+-+Tracy+Chapman+%5BVinyl%5D-luckburz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1f7aa8dc23086593cc728db55a7b6a09fa504d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,247,170,141,194,48,134,89,60,199,40,219,85,167,182,160,159,165,4,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
