The Stooges sold few records in their original incarnation and often performed for indifferent or hostile audiences. Nevertheless, The Stooges are often regarded as hugely influential in alternative rock, heavy metal and, especially, punk rock. Singer Iggy Pop and his often-outrageous onstage performances were often the main focus of attention. They reformed in 2003, with bassist Mike Watt replacing the deceased Dave Alexander. The Stooges have been nominated for possible 2009 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e3b1d2917b3b07bff049214dc4abd3f54f0836","amp;dn":"The+Stooges-12+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e3b1d2917b3b07bff049214dc4abd3f54f0836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,227,177,210,145,123,59,7,191,240,73,33,77,196,171,211,245,79,8,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
