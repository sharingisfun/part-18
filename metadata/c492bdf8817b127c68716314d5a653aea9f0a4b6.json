If your running into crashes try running the 32bit version by double clicking the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Install_32bitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in your SteamAppscommon7 Days To Die folder\nCurrently there are no upgrade/downgrade path for concrete, reinforced concrete or metal doors.\n\n\nNew Systems Guide\n\nAlpha 7.10 came with upgradable downgradable blocks, land claims, friends list and locking doors and chests. Here is a little more information on how these systems work.\n\n\nUpgradable and Downgradable blocks\n\nPlayers can build wood frames and while holding a stone axe with wood planks in their inventory right click on a wood frame block and upgrade it to a wood block and repeat action to upgrade it to a reinforced wood block. Then if you have scrap metal you can upgrade it once again to metal reinforced wood block. These same blocks can be damaged and downgraded to their previous states and then repaired and upgraded again.\nThere is also a higher grade cobblestone path that upgrades form metal rebar to cobblestone to fortified to reinforced metal concrete\n\n\nLand Claims\n\nNew players are awarded 1 land claim keystone block in their starting inventory if a server is running Survival PvP. Ways to earn more will be added in future updates.\nYou can kill players and loot their land claim blocks if they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been placed or mine up a land claim block and steal it for your own so its wise to protect your land claim blocks.\nThe keystone block is a special looking block that when carried by the player shows a 7Ãƒâ€”7 or server set protection grid rendered as a transparent green protected grid.\nThe keystone block offers durability protection 7Ãƒâ€”7 all the way vertically\nKeystone blocks can be destroyed by other players removing their durability modifier of the fort.\nOnly the owner and friends in your group can build blocks in your land claimed areas.\nLand claims have a no claim zone outside of their perimeter where only the land. claim owner and friends in his group can stake additional neighboring claims. Default could be 30 meters measuring keystone to keystone (This could be an optional owner permission setting).\nOnly the owner of a land claim and friends in his group can add new neighboring land claims right next to an existing land claim but not overlapping.\nZombies and owners/friends of the claim owner are not affected by claim durability.\nPlayers must revisit claim once a real-time day to prevent Claim Decay.\n\nLand Claim Game Options include\n\nClaim Size Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sets the size of the protected area around a land claim block. Default is 7Ãƒâ€”7 all the way vertically.\nClaim Deadzone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sets the distance neighboring non friended players can place their land claims. Default is 30 blocks/meters away.\nClaim Duration Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The number of days a player can be offline before their land claims expire. Default is 3 real-time days\nClaim Decay Mode Ã¢â‚¬â€œ How a land claimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardness modifier decays over time that the claim owner is not on the server. Default is Slow\nClaim Health Online Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The hardness modifier applied to land claims for players who are currently online. Default is 32x harder to destroy.\nClaim Health Offline Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The hardness modifier applied to land claims for players who are currently offline. Default is 32x harder to destroy.\n\n\nFriends list\n\nThe new friends list can be found if click on the friends tab in the main inventory menu accessed by hitting Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in-game. From there you can invite players on the server to friend, see invites, accept invites and remove friends. Friends have advantages like sharing buildable areas, seeing each other player icons and turning on friendly fire if these options are set on the server.\n\n\nLocking Doors and Chests\n\nPlayers who craft doors can lock them, unlock them and set passwords which can be shared with other players. Note the player who owns the door or chest never has to unlock it or enter a code to open the door. Friends who know the password only have to enter it once.\n\n\nAMT Added Features:\n\n7DTD - Server Manager (by frontrunnertek)\nCustom Dedicated.ini &amp; Startdedicated.bat for using SSE to host a server.\nRemoved ALT + TAB cycling you to a random game.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to FrontRunner, HAL and the creators of SmartSteam.\n\nCheck the Tunngle 7 Days To Die rooms for servers.\n\n\t\n-=[ DerpTeam ]=-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://DerpTeam.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://DerpTeam.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTeamSpeak 3: DerpTeam.Enjinvoice.com\n\nServer IP:  DerpTeam.ServerPit.com:25000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c492bdf8817b127c68716314d5a653aea9f0a4b6","amp;dn":"7+Days+To+Die+Alpha+7.11+Steam+Edition+AMT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c492bdf8817b127c68716314d5a653aea9f0a4b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,146,189,248,129,123,18,124,104,113,99,20,213,166,83,174,169,240,164,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
