Sitting tucked away in the vaults for over four decades, the Zappa Estate and Eagle Rock are finally giving fans what they have been asking for, and believe me, it was well worth the wait. Available in both DVD and Blu-ray formats, both with a companion soundtrack CD, Roxy-The Movie is a document of perhaps Frank Zappa's most accomplished band, which included George Duke (keyboards, vocals), Bruce Fowler (trombone), Napoleon Murphy Brock (sax, flute, vocals), Ruth Underwood (percussion, vibes), Tom Fowler (bass), Ralph Humphrey (drums), and Chester Thompson (drums).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists:...............-Frank Zappa\r\nAlbum Name:............-Roxy The Movie \r\nQuality:...............-320 / FLAC\r\nSize:..................-704MB\r\nTracks:................-20\r\nLenght:................-01:56:12\r\nGenre:.................-Soundtrack, Rock\r\nCountry:...............-USA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
