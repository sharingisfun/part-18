They loom over museum halls, thunder through movies, and are a fundamental part of our collective imagination. In My Beloved Brontosaurus, the dinosaur fanatic Brian Switek enriches the childlike sense of wonder these amazing creatures instill in us. Investigating the latest discoveries in paleontology, he breathes new life into old bones.\n\nSwitek reunites us with these mysterious creatures as he visits desolate excavation sites and hallowed museum vaults, exploring everything from the sex life of Apatosaurus and T. rexÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feather-laden body to just why dinosaurs vanished. (And of course, on his journey, he celebrates the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s titular hero, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BrontosaurusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€who suffered a second extinction when we learned he never existed at allÃ¢â‚¬â€as a symbol of scientific progress.)\n\nWith infectious enthusiasm, Switek questions what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve long held to be true about these beasts, weaving in stories from his obsession with dinosaurs, which started when he was just knee-high to a Stegosaurus. Endearing, surprising, and essential to our understanding of our own evolution and our place on Earth, My Beloved Brontosaurus is a book that dinosaur fans and anyone interested in scientific progress will cherish for years to come.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nIn this revealing work of pop paleontology, Switek (Written in Stone) travels across America to visit dinosaur fossils, but don't let the subtitle and descriptions of stunning scenery and trips down gravel roads mislead youÃ¢â‚¬â€this isn't really a travelogue: each stop serves as but a jumping-off point for an examination of our changing understanding of dinosaurs. As a child, Switek learned that his beloved Brontosaurus had been denounced as a distinct species and relabeled Apatosaurus; in the course of his travels, he learns that other dinosaurs have met a similar fateÃ¢â‚¬â€but he doesn't see this as something to be mourned. In fact, it's proof of the great strides being made in the science of dinos. Along the way, Switek describes a host of colorful characters, including Heinrich Mallison, who uses digital modeling software to figure out how certain dinosaursÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly the troublingly spiky-tailed KentrosaurusÃ¢â‚¬â€had sex. He also demonstrates that contrary to the relatively dowdy dinos of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park, new science suggests many were feathered, and colorfully at that. Engaging and accessible enough for the lay person, readers will readily agree when Switek concludes that &quot;dinosaurs are better than ever.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“SwitekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing is crisp and clean, and he knows his dinosaurs . . . [He] does a good job of keeping up with the latest refinements in dinosaur science. Crucially, he shares his enthusiasm well, writing about the fun, the weird and the wonderful without the tall tales of the explorers of old.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€New Scientist\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[Switek] offer a compelling mixture of reliable inforÃ‚Â­mation, personal experiences and thoughts, anecdotes about paleontological research and even science philosophy, delivered in a breezy and engaging style . . . [he] paints a comprehensive picture of how our understanding of dinosaur evoÃ‚Â­lution gradually advances . . . Switek has succeeded in covering a wide range of interÃ‚Â­esting topics in dinosaur palaeontology with infectious enthusiasm.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Nature\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Switek earned fame as the unabashed dinosaur advocate behind the fossil-focused blog Laelaps. He applies that same blend of boyish exuberance and serious science to this exploration of paleontologyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots, revisions, and future course . . . his zeal is infectious . . . Switek fleshes out the monstrous skeletons that we all remember from childhood museum field trips with meaty new findings about their anatomy and behavior.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Discover","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47342c211ad6b9081d9b3000734943e2c7a45cb4","amp;dn":"Brian+Switek+-+My+Beloved+Brontosaurus+%5B96%5D+Unabridged+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47342c211ad6b9081d9b3000734943e2c7a45cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,52,44,33,26,214,185,8,29,155,48,0,115,73,67,226,199,164,92,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
