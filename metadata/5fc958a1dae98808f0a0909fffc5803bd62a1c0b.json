A nationally renowned investigative reporter with her own TV show and a tough-as-nails reputation, Max tackles cold cases from across the country and every walk of life. But the one unsolved murder that still haunts her is a case from her own past.\n\nWhen Max was a high school senior, one of her best friends was strangled and another, Kevin OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neal, accused of the crime. To the disgrace of her wealthy family, Max stood by her friend, until she found out he lied about his alibi. Though his guilt was never proven, their relationship crumbled from the strain of too many secrets.\n\nNow Max is home for KevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeralÃ¢â‚¬â€after years of drug abuse, he committed suicide. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finally prepared to come to terms with the loss of his friendship, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not prepared for KevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister to stubbornly insist that he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kill himself. Or for an elderly couple to accost her at the airport, begging her to look into another murder at MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old high school. Max is more interested in the cold case at her alma mater than in digging around KevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled life, but she agrees to do both. As Max uncovers dark secrets, she finds herself caught in a complicated web of lies that hit far too close to home. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s becoming increasingly clear that someone will do whatever it takes to make sure the truth stays buried.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nAllison Brennan is the New York Times bestselling and award-winning author of twenty romantic thrillers and many short stories.
