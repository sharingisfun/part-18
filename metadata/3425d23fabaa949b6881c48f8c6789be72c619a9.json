The Tempter? The Great Red Dragon? Apollyon; the Destroyer? One being is revealed to have all these titles and more? Names that reveal his horrific nature? All names given to Satan, your adversary who comes like a lion Ã¢â‚¬Å“seeking whom he may devourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1 Peter 5:8).\n\nToday, many people question and even mock the very existence of Satan, as well as the reality of evil. Even in the church, there are few biblical resources that effectively counter the destructive claims raised in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humanistic culture. Through The Fall of Satan: Rebels in the Garden you will discover the answers to 35 captivating questions, such as:\n\n-Who is Satan?\n-Why would God, who is not evil, allow evil to continue to exist?\n-ShouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Eve have been shocked that a serpent spoke?\n-Did the serpent originally have legs?\n-When did Satan rebel?\n-Was the forbidden fruit an apple?\n-Who were the Nephilim?\n\nWhere can the answers be found to such provocative, spiritual questions that have been asked so many times over? Carefully consider the biblical response, since it is the only completely reliable foundation for information about Satan. We must reject unqualified conclusions drawn from sources outside the Bible, such as the current ideas and traditions of the culture. No believer should be unaware of these sound answers found in the Bible. It is our absolute authority. In The Fall of Satan: Rebels in the Garden, sound answers await you!\n\n\nAbout the author:\nBodie attended Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIUC) and received a BS and MS (in 1996 and 1998 respectively) there in mechanical engineering. His specialty was a subset of mechanical engineering based in advanced materials processing, particularly starting powders.\nHe conducted research for his masterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree through a grant from Lockheed Martin and developed a New Method of Production of Submicron Titanium Diboride. The new process was able to make titanium diboride cheaper, faster and with higher quality. This technology is essential for some nanotechnologies. He was only 24 years old when he began teaching undergraduate engineering courses at the university.\nWhile working at Caterpillar, he taught apologetics to junior high and high school students. He did this until accepting a position with Answers in Genesis in 2003.
