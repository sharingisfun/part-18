After being approached to do a concept album of hip-hop as it would sound in different time periods, Emcee Elemental created the character of Professor Elemental. While the album never came to fruition, the character stuck.[2] Professor Elemental has since been seen performing as a solo act or in theatre acts such as Come Into My Parlour. He is also popular at steampunk events and has been a headliner at the Steampunk World's Fair and the Waltz on the Wye.\n\nThe Professor Elemental character first gained notoriety with his music video for &quot;Cup of Brown Joy,&quot; (Directed by Moog) which got the attention of Warren Ellis. Since then he has released a new album, continued his work in the community and performed live. He was, until recently, in a feud with fellow &quot;chap-hop&quot; artist Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer. However, Professor Elemental had a short appearance in Mr. B's music video for the song &quot;Like a Chap&quot;, of which Professor Elemental said &quot;Much as I hate to admit it, I bloody love that video and am jolly glad [Mr. B] let me gate crash&quot; Mr. B reciprocated with a cameo on Elemental's video for his song, &quot;I'm British&quot; (which also featured appearances by members of the Eccentric Club, of which Elemental is a member, and the UK division of the Army of Toy Soldiers). The two seem to have finally settled their differences in the track, &quot;The Duel&quot;, on Elemental's 2012 album &quot;The Father of Invention&quot; where after a rap battle, both agree that the other is jolly good at what they do and go to enjoy a crate of sherry and some opium.\n\nAlbums Included:\nElements of the Professor (Tom Caurana Instrumentals Vol. 5) [2013]\nFather of Invention [2012]\nThe Indifference Engine [2012]\nMore Tea? [2011]\n\nEnjoy. :) \nSeed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1143b453869604035bfcc88b34c45bf2a7e97a23","amp;dn":"Professor+Elemental+Full+Discography+%5B2011-2013%5D+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1143b453869604035bfcc88b34c45bf2a7e97a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,67,180,83,134,150,4,3,91,252,200,139,52,196,91,242,167,233,122,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
