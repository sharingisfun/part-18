As Hugh Hefner, players must strategically create the content of the Playboy publication including images and articles, as they adjust to an ever-changing market on a road filled with riches and fame. To do so, users must build their fantasy mansion from grounds to grotto, throw parties, rub shoulders with VIPs, and live up to the free-minded Playboy lifestyle. You can even interact with your guests, setup interviews and photo-shoots, and partake in more intimate activities that we cannot even begin to describe here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1722bdbb9ea41f37eb311b5e7aa5db5baba9d094","amp;dn":"Playboy%3A+The+Mansion+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1722bdbb9ea41f37eb311b5e7aa5db5baba9d094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,34,189,187,158,164,31,55,235,49,27,94,122,165,219,91,171,169,208,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
