I have one and James Taylor has its own place of honour. However, just like John Mayer, their recordings do not have the (sound) quality one would like.\n\nSo its hard to make a playable list that sounds good all the way. I looked for the best (sounding) tracks that do justice to the remarkable artist James really is. The fact he is like my friend next door and consequently he is easily overlooked, only adds to his greatness. You may be the judgeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Enjoy,\n\n\nDutch Treat - ^B044 Sweet Baby James (James Taylor)\n\n01 James Taylor &amp; Mark Knopfler - Sailing To Philadelphia\n02 James Taylor - Little More Time With You\n03 James Taylor - Isn't It Nice To Be Home Again\n04 James Taylor - Carolina In My Mind\n05 James Taylor - Mexico\n06 James Taylor - Fire And Rain\n07 James Taylor - Handy Man\n08 James Taylor - Up On The Roof\n09 James Taylor - Never Die Young\n10 James Taylor - Walking Man\n11 James Taylor - Shower The People\n12 James Taylor - Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\n13 James Taylor - Sweet Baby James\n14 James Taylor - You Can Close Your Eyes\n15 James Taylor - Jump Up Behind Me\n16 James Taylor - Up Er Mei\n17 James Taylor - Line 'em Up\n18 James Taylor - Shower The People (L)\n19 James Taylor - Steamroller Blues (L)\n20 James Taylor - You Make It Easy (L)\n21 James Taylor - Secret O' Life (L)\n22 James Taylor - Country Road (L)\n23 James Taylor - Riding On A Railroad (L)\n24 James Taylor - New Hymn (L)\n25 James Taylor - Traffic Jam (L)\n26 James Taylor - Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight (L)\n27 James Taylor - Millworker (L)\n28 James Taylor - You've Got A Friend (A)\n29 James Taylor - How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You) (L)\n30 James Taylor - Walking My Baby Back Home\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2bea098911c06aacbb53e41c8b81d49cd6ea54","amp;dn":"James+Taylor+%28Folk%29+-+Sweet+Baby+James+%28Dutch+Treat+B044%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2bea098911c06aacbb53e41c8b81d49cd6ea54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,43,234,9,137,17,192,106,172,187,83,228,28,139,129,212,156,214,234,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
