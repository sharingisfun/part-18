But Josie isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t there. In fact, Josie isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t anywhere. When her Jeep is found abandoned in a parking lot near the Redondo pier, the only clue to her whereabouts leads Archer to Daniel Young, an expert witness for the prosecution in the case that made JosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation as a defense attorney ten years earlier. Fighting to keep Hannah from being taken into custody by child protective services, racing against a clock ticking off the minutes of JosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, Archer reluctantly partners with Daniel Young and a rogue Hermosa Beach detective, Liz Driscoll, to race down a winding road of intrigue. From the Hollywood Hills to the glitzy evangelical enclave of Orange County; the seedy side of Los Angeles to the pristine and remote California mountains, Archer bores into the past. What he finds is that the woman he loves was once a ruthless and hated defense attorney, that the system he believes in has released a double murderer, and that there is more than one person who would be happy if Josie Bates was never seen again.\nGenre: Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0457fbef5928ac0b8704527a07ebcb6e955850ea","amp;dn":"Expert+Witness+-+Rebecca+Forster+%281%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0457fbef5928ac0b8704527a07ebcb6e955850ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,87,251,239,89,40,172,11,135,4,82,122,7,235,203,110,149,88,80,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
