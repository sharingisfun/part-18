Backing them both to the hilt is DI Natalie Chandler (Harriet Walter). Once the crooks are caught and the evidence has been gathered, the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) takes over. Fighting furiously for justice week in week out is Senior Crown Prosecutor James Steel (Ben Daniels), who is supported by the younger but equally committed Alesha Phillips (Freema Agyeman). They're kept in check by CPS director George Castle (Bill Paterson), who steers his office with a steady hand. \n[IMDB]\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e138aa11f3fb18b66d6fbaa7d443b0874342eb18","amp;dn":"Law+and+Order+UK+Season+2+%5Bfun-tv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e138aa11f3fb18b66d6fbaa7d443b0874342eb18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,56,170,17,243,251,24,182,109,111,186,167,212,67,176,135,67,66,235,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
