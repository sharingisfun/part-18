In total, 425 units were built, primarily for the American and Mexican market, and some can still be found on US railroads today.\n\nThe Alco RS-11 for Train Simulator, developed by virtualRailroads, is available in Pennsylvania Railroad livery and features fully detailed and working cab, dynamic braking capability and independent wiper control.\n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Alco RS-11 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Horseshoe Curve.\n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nJoin Railworks Central for more addons, support and discussions at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor support and requests email:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9febfafef2ebeffdabfae9faeddff8f2fef6f3b1fcf0f2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIf you want to say thanks, contribute and share an addon with the community then email them to us...
