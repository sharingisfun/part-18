More than 150 years after the introduction of the Anhalter Bahn, it is today a modern traffic system with speeds allowing up to 200 km/h. The complete 118km long route has been modeled in extreme detail by the developer team. Original stations, depots and landscapes are absolutely beautifully modeled and really draw you into the special flair of this route. Especially the night service will delight you with its atmosphere. But with this all not enough, thereÃ‚Â´s a unique feature that comes with this add-on: You will have the chance to drive to the not yet opened new Berlin Airport, even before its inauguration.\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nPlease use the email address for requests and questions and if you want to share an addon with the community then contact us and we will post it on your behalf.
