The first is Concert No.2 For Marimba\n\n1.Reflections and Dreams - 8:27\n\n2.Walking on Clouds - 8:06\n\n3.Water Running in High Mountain - 6:41\n\n\nThe next disc is the four movements of Marimba Concerto.  I think its a full orchestra, but who knows?\n\n1.Greetings - 3:33\n\n2.Lament - 6:41\n\n3.Dance - 3:48\n\n4.Farewell - 5:09\n\n\nI believe, but am not sure, that most of these are performed by the University of Calgary or Miami ensembles.  Rosauro, i think, teaches at one &gt;.&lt;    \n\n\nNey Rosauro wrote both pieces and still composes for percussion.  I have played some and they aren't just awesome to listen too...they're equally fun.\n\n\nHis website is NeyRosauro.com  Please support artists and seed :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58753a65bda5ff7ea8fe07490703470862eadc4f","amp;dn":"Ney+Rosauro+%28Classical+Marimba%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58753a65bda5ff7ea8fe07490703470862eadc4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,117,58,101,189,165,255,126,168,254,7,73,7,3,71,8,98,234,220,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
