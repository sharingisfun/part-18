When Johnno and his friends survive the freak storm that rips apart their yacht, they're just glad to be alive. That is, until reality hits: they've washed up on an uninhabited island with few supplies, no phone and no way to get home.\n\nThe situation becomes even more desperate when the four teenagers discover they are not alone on the island. There's a hideout where men with guns are covering up a dark secret that they will protect at any cost.\n\nWith nowhere to run, Johnno and his friends are forced into a dangerous game with the criminals as they fight to save one of their own.\n\nThe Other Side of Nowhere is a dangerous place to be when you're hungry, trapped, and being hunted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86647eb99c9041297101e5c0cf9b906f3aa2f57b","amp;dn":"The+Other+Side+of+Nowhere+-+Steve+Johnston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86647eb99c9041297101e5c0cf9b906f3aa2f57b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,100,126,185,156,144,65,41,113,1,229,192,207,155,144,111,58,162,245,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
