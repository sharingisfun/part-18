Slipstream\nAbout a Luftwaffe pilot who must choose between his duty to his country: to guard a bomber loaded with Germany's final hope of victory... the world's first atomic bomb... or his duty to the world: to let it fall in flames to enemy Spitfires and be a footnote in history. Of course, things are complicated by the plane's other cargo... the woman he loves. \n\n2. Sonic Boom Squadron\nNear the end of the war, Japan has implemented a new weapon -- a human-piloted rocket-propelled flying bomb. Aboard a bomber carrying one of these, young Ensign Nogami awaits his chance to die as a &quot;cherry blossom&quot;, a suicide pilot. In a few hours, he will die. The date of his death is set: August 6, 1945.\n\n3. Knight of the Iron Dragon\nTwo soldiers attempt to reach an air base in order to fulfill a promise despite the fact that it might have been rendered moot in the reality of war.\n\nRead more at http://myanimelist.net/anime/2500/The_Cockpit#kG8dyMee7DI4Bh6h.99\n\nVideo: 720p, degrained in bright areas, partially stabilized (thus overcropped by 2px from each side)\nAudio: Japanese AACq0.9 stereo, English AC-3 stereo\nSubs: 1.
