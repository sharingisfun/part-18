It features such delightful treatments as gargling sugared snail juice for a sore throat (from 1920s Lincolnshire), soothing a child's teething pains with a dab of cocaine (c19th), and curing a lovesick man by dressing as a haggard version of his beloved and hurling abuse at him. Covering disease, surgery, cosmetics, keeping fit and curing madness, it offers a fascinating - and undeniably grim - view of the tortuous ways in which our ancestors tried to stay in shape.\n\n\nBy Caroline Rance\nPublished by Osprey Publishing in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 144 pages, English (1783660279)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3715571152d6643dbdd84d1cef3b5206112542bd","amp;dn":"What+the+Apothecary+Ordered+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3715571152d6643dbdd84d1cef3b5206112542bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,21,87,17,82,214,100,61,189,216,77,28,239,59,82,6,17,37,66,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
