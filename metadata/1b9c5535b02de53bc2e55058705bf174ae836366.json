Villagers far and wide welcome her with both awe and disdain, grateful to her for ridding their towns of the undead menace, but finding themselves made poorer for their salvation. Magiere has always known she's dealing with simple folk who only wish to have their superstitions silenced, and she's never seen anything wrong with exploiting them for profit.\nNow, tired of the game, Magiere and her partner, the half-elf Leesil, are ready to hang up their weapons and settle down in a place they can finally call home. But their new found peace will not last. For Magiere has come to the attention of a trio of powerful and dangerous vampires who recognize her true identity - even if she does not - and who fear the birthright that flows through her veins. And they will stop at nothing to keep Magiere from fulfilling her destiny.\n_____\n\n\n#2 Thief of Lives \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388202581l/413896.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388202581l/413896.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOn the heels of Dhampir, Barb and J.C.

After settling down in her newly adopted village of Miiska Ã¢â‚¬â€ now vampire-free, thanks to her and her half-elf partner, Leesil Ã¢â‚¬â€ she looks forward to quiet days tending to her tavern.\n\nBut far away in the capital city of Bela, a prominent councilman's daughter has been found dead on her own doorstep... and all signs point to a vampire. Knowing that the battered and burned village of Miiska could use an infusion of cash, Bela's town council offers a generous bounty to the dhampir if she will slay their vampire. Magiere resists, wanting nothing more than to forget her past and ignore her half-vampire nature. Only Leesil can persuade Magiere to follow her destiny Ã¢â‚¬â€ before more innocent lives are claimed by darkness.\n_____\n\n#3 Sister of the Dead\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388455304l/413963.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388455304l/413963.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Noble Dead saga continues as Magiere and Leesil, the slayers of the undead for Dhampir and Thief of Lives, embark on a quest to uncover the secrets of their mysterious origins Ã¢â‚¬â€ and those responsible for orchestrating the events that brought them together...\n\nMagiere is a dhampir Ã¢â‚¬â€ half-human, half-vampire Ã¢â‚¬â€ sired for the purpose of slaying the undead.

Before Leesil can reveal the truth to Magiere, they must vanquish a creature of unimaginable and unlimited power who has damned a small village of people with a horrifying curse...\n___\n\n#4 Traitor to the Blood \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388202581l/591821.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388202581l/591821.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBorn a half-breed to an elven mother and human father, Leesil was raised in the Warlands as assassin, spy, and slave to Lord Darmouth, ruler to one of its independent provinces.
