It combines the combat mechanics of action-rpgs\nwith the top-down view of the classic old-school RPG and RTS games.\n\nThe game brings you far into the future of a post-apocalyptic Sweden.\nOnce home to IKEA, Vikings and Minecraft, today its primitive\ninhabitants scavenge the broken overgrown world for technological\nartifacts.\n\nFeatures:\n\nUnlimited Adventure - no matter how deep you crawl, there is always\nmore to explore in an open game world where randomized dungeons and\nevents are combined with more than 60 thoroughly designed locations and\n200 quests in order to create a vast gaming experience. Locations\nrange from small settlements with a handful of struggling inhabitants\nto large urban areas like Solside City, a sprawling regional HUB where\nyou'll find all sorts of NPCs and services.\n\nCo-op - Seamless blending of coop and singleplayer - use your\ncharacters to explore an open-ended game world in single player,\neither by following the main story campaign or just free-roaming the\nKrater (or a mix of both). You can at any time have your team join\nup with a friend to take on one of the challenging co-op dungeons\n. All the loot earned and progress made is kept regardless of game\nmode. And yes, your grinding efforts will be kept for the coming PvP\nexpansion as well\n\nVisual appearance: The game uses the DX11 API (but it also support\nDX10 hardware) to be able to use beautiful and varied environment and\ncharacter art. The enemy units are not all simple texture variations on\nthe same model, but sport unique meshes, animation sets and effects to\na large extent.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1. Unpack the release\n2. Mount or burn image\n3. Install\n4. Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder into the game installation\n5. Play the game\n6.
