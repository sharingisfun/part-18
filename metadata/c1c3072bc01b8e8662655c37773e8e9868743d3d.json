My favorites among those are Phil Capelle's books when I want some textbook style and Mastering Pool by George Fels if I'm just in the mood for reading (it's still quite educational).\n\nThe Leman.djvu and Gofmeister.djvu files are historic books on Russian Pyramid in Russian language that I put here just for the sake of diversity. They are, of course, of limited interest to non-Russian speakers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1c3072bc01b8e8662655c37773e8e9868743d3d","amp;dn":"Miscellaneous+pool+and+billiards+instructional+books+-+interpool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1c3072bc01b8e8662655c37773e8e9868743d3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,195,7,43,192,27,142,134,98,101,92,55,119,62,142,152,104,116,61,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
