Why she doesn't cut an entire album is beyond me, judging from the reviews of this CD a lot of people would buy it. She has a very sexy, kind of classic voice. This CD isn't that bad, as far as the other songs on it; Christmas classics you know. But, it wouldn't be the same without her.\n\n1. Louis Prima &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;-5/5-A very jazzy/swingy song. It's really catchy though.\n\n2. Ella Fitzgerald &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;-5/5-I love this song and I love the way Ella Fitzgerald sings it.\n\n3. Lena Home &quot;Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow&quot;-4/5-I like this song but I'm not a big fan of how Home sings the song.\n\n4. Ferrante and Teicher/Les Baxter &quot;Sleigh Ride/Santa Claus Party&quot;-5/5-The first part is an instrumental version of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;. The second part is\n\n&quot;Santa Claus Party&quot; which is a funny christmas song which is damn cool.\n\n5. Zooey Deschanel &amp; Leon Redbone &quot;Baby It's Cold Outside&quot;-5/5-This is a really cool song and Zooey Deschanel has a gorgeous voice. It was for Deschanel that I bought this album. Her voice is flawless and she sings this beautifully. I wish she would get into the studio and cut an album.\n\n6. Jim Reeves &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;-4/5-It's Jingle Bells. Nothing more to say really.\n\n7. Brian Setzer &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;-5/5-Very well done instrumental. Too long though.\n\n8. Leon Redbone &quot;Christmas Island&quot;-5/5-I had never heard this song before, but it's pretty interesting.\n\n9. Eartha Kitt &quot;Santa Baby&quot;-5/5-This song cracks me up. I've heard this song countless times, but I never bothered to check out the lyrics. Good song.\n\n10. Leon Redbone &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;-5/5-Awesome song. Redbone's voice sounds different on this song.\n\n11. Eddy Arnold &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&quot;-5/5-Arnold does a great cover of this song. I would've been happier if they would've put the cast of &quot;Elf's version of it on here&quot; (mostly due to Zooey Deschanel's voice featured on it.)\n\n12. Billy Preston &quot;Nothing From Nothing&quot;-5/5-I had never heard this song before and this is not a Christmas song, per se. But, this guy Billy Preston has an interesting voice so it all works out.\n\nA+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a587869a63b215e073d5a5294462138518cacc0","amp;dn":"Elf+-+Music+From+The+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a587869a63b215e073d5a5294462138518cacc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,88,120,105,166,59,33,94,7,61,90,82,148,70,33,56,81,140,172,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
