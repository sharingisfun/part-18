Goodnight Irene\n\nHuddie William Ledbetter (January 1888 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ December 6, 1949) was an iconic American folk and blues musician, notable for his strong vocals, his virtuosity on the 12-string guitar, and the songbook of folk standards he introduced.\nHe is best known as Leadbelly or Lead Belly. Though many releases list him as &quot;Leadbelly,&quot; he himself spelled it &quot;Lead Belly.&quot; This is also the usage on his tombstone, as well as of the Lead Belly Foundation.\nAlthough he most commonly played the twelve string, he could also play the piano, mandolin, harmonica, violin, concertina, and accordion. In some of his recordings, such as in one of his versions of the folk ballad &quot;John Hardy&quot;, he performs on the accordion instead of the guitar. In other recordings he just sings while clapping his hands or stomping his foot. The topics of Lead Belly's music covered a wide range of subjects, including gospel songs; blues songs about women, liquor and racism; and folk songs about cowboys, prison, work, sailors, cattle herding and dancing. He also wrote songs concerning the newsmakers of the day, such as President Franklin Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, Jean Harlow, the Scottsboro Boys, and Howard Hughes.\n\nTrivia: Western Plain (from Classics in Jazz), When The Boys Were Out On The Western Plains (from Midnight Special) and Cow Cow Yiky Yiki Yea (from The Very Best Of) is the same song.\n\nMore Trivia: &quot;Midnight Special&quot; is a traditional folk song thought to have originated among prisoners in the American South. The title comes from the refrain which refers to the Midnight Special and its &quot;ever-loving light&quot; (sometimes &quot;ever-living light&quot;).\nLet the Midnight Special shine her light on me,\nLet the Midnight Special shine her ever-loving light on me. (Traditional)\nThe song is historically performed in the country-blues style from the viewpoint of the prisoner. The song has been covered by many different artists.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a84002fd821469844626269d267ec8f9715d4074","amp;dn":"Leadbelly+-+2+Albums+-+320+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a84002fd821469844626269d267ec8f9715d4074","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,64,2,253,130,20,105,132,70,38,38,157,38,126,200,249,113,93,64,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
