The three women sing with a band led by Dr. John and the session features guest appearances by such luminaries as David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman and Jimmie Vaughan. The music is straight out of the Texas school of roadhouse R&amp;B and blues boogie but it's delivered with a gritty, hearfelt edge, particularly on the part of the three vocalists. Dreams Come True may follow formula, but it's followed with style and affection, which makes it a very enjoyable listen.
