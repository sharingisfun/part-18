MacColl, MacLennan, MartinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ 4:28 \nComposed by: MacColl, MacLennan, Martin, Traditional  \n\nFans of the Tannahill Weavers know just what to expect, and they get it here: an opening set of swirling pipe tunes to get your heart racing, then an achingly gorgeous vocal tune filled with historical regret and couched in intricate harmonies. Then more of the same: a set of swirling flute tunes (the wonderful &quot;One for the Road Set&quot;) followed by a slightly less-achingly gorgeous love song. And again: a medley of tunes from Brittany, then -- you know -- an achingly gorgeous love song. Got it? Predictable the pattern may be, but that doesn't make this album any less fun. If it doesn't quite measure up to the brilliance of one or two other Tannahill Weavers albums (Capernaum, for instance), it's only because it lacks a clear centerpiece of musical transcendence, though a thoroughly charming rendition of the traditional classic &quot;Malley Leigh&quot; comes close. Recommended. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/11/the-tannahill-weavers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/11/the-tannahill-weavers/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9365ffe066b1591f411522f84a1fd3c3d16057d","amp;dn":"The+Tannahill+Weavers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9365ffe066b1591f411522f84a1fd3c3d16057d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,54,95,254,6,107,21,145,244,17,82,47,132,161,253,60,61,22,5,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
