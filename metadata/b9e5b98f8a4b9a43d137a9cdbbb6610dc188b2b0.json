The monthly magazine was launched in October 1980 by \nTime Inc. Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for \nscience magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be \nsomewhat easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and \nscience oriented than magazines like Popular Science. Discover was left \nlargely alone in its market space by the mid-1980s, but nevertheless \ndecided to appeal to a wider audience, including more articles on \npsychology and psychiatry.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9e5b98f8a4b9a43d137a9cdbbb6610dc188b2b0","amp;dn":"Discover+Magazine.+2010+Full+Collection.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9e5b98f8a4b9a43d137a9cdbbb6610dc188b2b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,229,185,143,138,75,154,67,209,55,169,205,187,182,97,13,193,136,178,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
