Early(ish) Humphry Bogart in his soon to be signiture tough guy role.  Wonderful cast of actors.  Still watchable and interesting 80 years later.  This one is good for just about anyones collection.\n\nFull screen, black and white, english only, no subs, dvdrip, excellent quality.\n\n\nIMDB:\nThe Dead End Kids are introduced in their intricate East Side slum, overlooked by the apartments of the rich. Their antics, some funny, some vicious, alternate with subplots: unemployed architect Dave is torn between Drina, sweet but equally poor, and Kay, a rich man&amp;#039;s mistress; gangster Baby Face Martin returns to his old neighborhood and finds that nobody is glad to see him. Then violent crime, both juvenile and adult, impacts the neighborhood and its people.
