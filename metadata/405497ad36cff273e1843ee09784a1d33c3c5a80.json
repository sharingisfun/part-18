This outing features Newton with three string players (violinists John Blake and Gayle Dixon and cellist Abdul Wadud) and a four-piece rhythm section (vibraphonist Jay Hoggard, pianist Kenny Kirkland, bassist Cecil McBee and drummer Billy Hart). Each of the five numbers has its purpose, including &quot;Mr. Dolphy&quot; (a tribute to Eric Dolphy), Wayne Shorter's moody &quot;Anna Maria,&quot; and a three-part suite about South Africa (&quot;Diamonds Are for Freedom&quot;). Well worth several listens.
