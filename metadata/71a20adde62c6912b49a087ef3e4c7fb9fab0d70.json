Nowadays Rogan josh does this with his curries.\n\n\n=============CD1==================\n  \n  [1]-[4] Piano Sonata no.1, op.6\n  [5]-[6] Piano Sonata no.2, op.19\n [7]-[10] Piano Sonata no.3, op.23\n[11]-[12] Piano Sonata no.4, op.30\n     [13] Quatre Morceaux, op.56\n     [14] Deux Danses, op.73\n     [15] Deux Poemes, op.32\n\n=============CD2==================\n\n      [1] Piano Sonata no.5, op.53\n      [2] Piano Sonata no.6, op.62\n      [3] Piano Sonata no.7, op.64\n      [4] Piano Sonata no.8, op.66\n      [5] Piano Sonata no.9, op.68\n      [6] Piano Sonata no.10, op.70\n      [7] Quatre Morceaux op.51 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71a20adde62c6912b49a087ef3e4c7fb9fab0d70","amp;dn":"Alexander+Scriabin+-+The+Piano+Sonatas+%28Vladimir+Ashkenazy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71a20adde62c6912b49a087ef3e4c7fb9fab0d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,162,10,221,230,44,105,18,180,154,8,126,243,228,199,251,159,171,13,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
