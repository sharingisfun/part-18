In the pre-Civil War United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty (personified by a malevolent slave owner, portrayed by Michael Fassbender), as well as unexpected kindnesses, Solomon struggles not only to stay alive, but to retain his dignity. In the twelfth year of his unforgettable odyssey, Solomon's chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist (Brad Pitt) will forever alter his life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5542d0631d637bf1e7c3129207989fe5e928b6e7","amp;dn":"12+Years+a+Slave+%282013%29+Screener","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5542d0631d637bf1e7c3129207989fe5e928b6e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,66,208,99,29,99,123,241,231,195,18,146,7,152,159,229,233,40,182,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
