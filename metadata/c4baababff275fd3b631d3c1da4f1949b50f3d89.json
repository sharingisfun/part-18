Now the Boston-based string band is emphasizing their epic side, too, on Wide Awake, the new EP out June 4. The seven-song collection serves as a milepost in the blossoming career of a group the Los Angeles Daily News praised as Ã¢â‚¬Å“virtuoso art folkies who understand the value of being just folks.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Wide Awake features six riveting new original songs that showcase singer Emma BeatonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soulful, enveloping voice on lush acoustic arrangements fleshed out by Matt Arcara on guitar, Wes Corbett on banjo, Jacob Jolliff on mandolin and Zoe Guigueno on bass. The EP also includes a cover of the Postal ServiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2003 electro-pop single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Such Great Heights,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which Joy Kills Sorrow has been performing in concert for a while after learning the song during a residency at the Lizard Lounge in Boston. Wide Awake, which follows the full-length albums Darkness Sure Becomes This City in 2010 and This Unknown Science in 2011, is also a chance to introduce listeners to Guigueno, who joined the band last fall. Together, the band members are beginning a new chapter for Joy Kills Sorrow as part of a story that continues to unfold. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little bit of a new direction for us,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Arcara says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re excited about where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4baababff275fd3b631d3c1da4f1949b50f3d89","amp;dn":"Joy+Kills+Sorrow+-+Wide+Awake+%5B2013%5D+%5BEP%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4baababff275fd3b631d3c1da4f1949b50f3d89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,186,171,171,255,39,95,211,182,49,211,193,218,79,25,73,181,15,61,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
