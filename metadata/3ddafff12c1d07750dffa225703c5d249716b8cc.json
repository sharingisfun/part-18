That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\nThis sixth alphabetical installment is: Alp--Ar\n\n\tLet me say thanks to all those who are seeding. These torrents are going multi-seeder much faster than I expected. As long as you keep them going, the faster I can pump these out.\n\n\tI also want to say thanks to those commenting. I know there are a lot of you out there, but it cheers my heart and encourages me to actually hear from you. Maybe some of the rest of you can toss in a remark or two? I appreciate it.\n\n\tNo time to say much else today. See you soon.\n\nToday's offering: All-Alo\n\nDC Comics\n\nAlpha Centurion Special (09-1996)\n          These Amalgam DC-Marvel hybrid comics should be (and are) distributed alphabetically but I thought why should be collected somewhere too\nAmalgam Collected\n     Amalgam 1996\n          Amazon (04-1996)\n          Assassins (04-1996)\n          Bruce Wayne, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D (04-1996)\n          Bullets and Bracelets (04-1996)\n          Doctor Strangefate (04-1996)\n          JLX (04-1996)\n          Legends of the Dark Claw (04-1996)\n          Magneto and the Magnetic Men (04-1996)\n          Speed Demon (04-1996)\n          Spider-Boy (04-1996)\n          Super Soldier (04-1996)\n          X-Patrol (04-1996)\n    Amalgam 1997\n          Bat-Thing (06-1997)\n          Challengers of the Fantastic (06-1997)\n          Dark Claw Adventures (06-1997)\n          Generation Hex (06-1997)\n          Iron Lantern (06-1007)\n          JLX Unleashed (06-1997)\n          Lobo the Duck (06-1997)\n          Spider-Boy Team-Up (06-1997)\n          Super Soldier-Man of War (06-1997)\n          The Exciting X-Patrol 001-The Curse of Brother Brood!
