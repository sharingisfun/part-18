But on each side of 12th and Delaware, soldiers stand locked in a passionate battle. On one side of the street sits an abortion clinic. On the other, a pro-life outfit often mistaken for the clinic it seeks to shut down.\n\nUsing skillful cinema-vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© observation that allows us to draw our own conclusions, Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing, the directors of Jesus Camp, expose the molten core of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most intractable conflict. As the pro-life volunteers paint a terrifying portrait of abortion to their clients, across the street, the staff members at the clinic fear for their doctors' lives and fiercely protect the right of their clients to choose. Shot in the year when abortion provider Dr. George Tiller was murdered in his church, the film makes these fears palpable. Meanwhile, women in need become pawns in a vicious ideological war with no end in sight.\nFilm Contact\nHeidi Ewing, Loki Films","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383cf6b009858c7134c2067cda4b6411695b87af","amp;dn":"12th.and.Delaware.2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383cf6b009858c7134c2067cda4b6411695b87af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,60,246,176,9,133,140,113,52,194,6,124,218,75,100,17,105,91,135,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
