Born Gloria Fajardo in Havana on September 1, 1957, she was raised primarily in Miami, FL, after her father, a bodyguard in the employ of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, was forced to flee the island following the 1959 coup helmed by Fidel Castro. In the fall of 1975, Fajardo and her cousin Merci Murciano auditioned for the Miami Latin Boys, a local wedding band headed by keyboardist Emilio Estefan. With their addition, the group was rechristened Miami Sound Machine and four years later, Fajardo and Estefan were wed. As Miami Sound Machine began composing their own original material, their fusion of pop, disco, and salsa earned a devoted local following, and in 1979 the group issued their first Spanish-language LP on CBS International. Despite a growing Hispanic fan base, they did not cross over to non-Latin audiences until &quot;Dr. Beat&quot; topped European dance charts in 1984.\nWith 1985&amp;#039;s Primitive Love, Miami Sound Machine recorded their first English-language effort, scoring three Top Ten pop hits in the U.S. alone with the infectious &quot;Conga,&quot; &quot;Bad Boy,&quot; and &quot;Words Get in the Way.&quot; For 1988&amp;#039;s triple-platinum Let It Loose, the group was billed as Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine, reeling off four Top Ten hits -- &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,&quot; &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Stay Away from You,&quot; the chart-topping &quot;Anything for You,&quot; and &quot;1-2-3.&quot; 1989&amp;#039;s Cuts Both Ways was credited to Estefan alone and generated her second number one hit, &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Wanna Lose You&quot;; however, while touring in support of the album, on March 20, 1990, her bus was struck by a tractor trailer. She suffered a broken vertebrae that required extensive surgery and kept her off the road for over a year. Emilio Estefan and the couple&amp;#039;s son were injured in the crash as well, but all three recovered. Estefan resurfaced in 1991 with Into the Light, again topping the charts with &quot;Coming Out of the Dark,&quot; a single inspired by her near-fatal accident; two more cuts from the album, &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Forget You&quot; and &quot;Live for Loving You,&quot; secured her foothold on the adult contemporary charts.\nWith 1993&amp;#039;s Mi Tierra, Estefan returned to her roots, recording her first Spanish-language record in close to a decade and earning a Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album; on the follow-up, 1994&amp;#039;s covers collection Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me, she also recalled her dance-pop origins with a rendition of the Vicki Sue Robinson disco classic &quot;Turn the Beat Around.&quot; Another all-Spanish effort, Abriendo Puertas, earned the Grammy as well, while Destiny featured &quot;Reach,&quot; named the official theme of the 1996 Summer Olympics. As Latin pop made new commercial headway thanks to the efforts of acts like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, Estefan reigned as the most successful crossover artist in Latin music history, with international record sales close to the 50 million mark. In 1999, she also made her feature film debut alongside Meryl Streep in Music of the Heart, recording the film&amp;#039;s title song as a duet with *NSYNC and scoring both a massive pop hit and an Oscar nomination in the process.\nA new Spanish-language album, Alma CaribeÃƒÂ±a, followed in the spring of 2000. Several months later, Estefan was awarded a Grammy for Best Music Video for &quot;No Me Dehes de Querer&quot; at the first annual Latin Grammy Awards. Her husband, Emilio, won for Producer of the Year. In 2003 Estefan released Unwrapped, an English-language effort that met a lukewarm reception from consumers and critics. She didn&amp;#039;t return with another new album for several years, as stopgap compilations such as Amor y Suerte: Exitos Romanticos (2004), The Essential Gloria Estefan (2006), and Oye Mi Canto: Los Ãƒâ€°xitos (2006) were released from time to time. When she did return, with 90 Millas in 2007, it was with a splash. The Cuban-themed, Spanish-language effort hearkened back to Mi Tierra and was a big hit on the Latin music scene; its lead single, &quot;No Llores,&quot; quickly scaled Billboard&amp;#039;s Hot Latin Tracks chart, and the album itself was a chart-topper as well.\n\nReview\n\nThis collection of pop hits is easy to listen to and hard to turn off, which is exactly what pop music is suppose to be. This 14 song compilation truly is the best of Gloria. You&amp;#039;ll recognize every song here, which is a tribute in itself. From infectious dance songs (1,2,3 - Get on Your Feet-Conga - Go Away)) to powerful heartbreak (I See Your Smile - Here We Are - Words Get in the Way) we get it all.\nWe also get the inspirational post accident (her back broken and hospitalized for months) songs, &quot;Coming Out of the Dark&quot; and Always Tomorrow&quot;. Even the wonderful seasonal &quot;Christmas Through Your Eyes&quot;, quickly becoming a holiday classic, is included. Gloria Estefan is really something special and one listen to this collection is proof enough.\nThe music is great, the production smooth, and Gloria&amp;#039;s emotional vocals always perfect. She makes this look so easy she sometimes doesn&amp;#039;t get credit for how difficult creating good pop music can be. Husband Emilio, a terrific artist in his own right, always manages to give just the right production to a tune, enhancing the flavor of a song while not overpowering Gloria&amp;#039;s emotional voice.\nThese hits are the perfect blend of popularity and artistry. In turns uplifting, exciting, and heartbreaking, this greatest hits album reminds us what is good about listening to radio occasionally. You might be missing out on something truly special that is right in front of us\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:016ea90674ce354e500d2ca06aa3c71227e12e15","amp;dn":"Gloria+Estefan+-+Greatest+Hits+-%281992%29%5BFAC-EAC-CUE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"016ea90674ce354e500d2ca06aa3c71227e12e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,110,169,6,116,206,53,78,80,13,44,160,106,163,199,18,39,225,46,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
