Published by Moonstone in 2009.\n\n**I don't own any of the content contained within this torrent, all credit goes to the creators of the comic**\n\nDescription:\n\n\nA new twist on ZOMBIES with action, horror and the uncomfortably recognizable in the old West! A stop-lossed Army vet. A president in office without the popular vote. A terror crisis gripping the nation. Meet William Wade, newly minted and seriously resentful secret agent for President Rutherford B. Hayes. His mission with cerebral partner J.J. Flynn: travel the West and investigate outbreaks of the living dead -- each one more horrifyingly advanced than the last. 1877 is turning out to be one rotten year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:880b97605908fea4d27e3a10e8ab3118107ab4f4","amp;dn":"Rotten+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"880b97605908fea4d27e3a10e8ab3118107ab4f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,11,151,96,89,8,254,164,210,126,58,16,232,171,49,24,16,122,180,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
