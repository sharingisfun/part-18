This legendary recording, available here for the first time, illustrates perfectly the scope and manner of Dylan s live repertoire in the months leading up to his debut release. In addition to the three originals, all newly minted by Dylan, he covers songs by the likes of Hank Williams, Woody Guthrie and Big Joe Williams, but interestingly does not perform any tracks that would feature on his first record just weeks from release at the time of this broadcast. Folksinger s Choice also contains the only known Dylan performances of Smokestack Lightning, Hard Travelin and Roll On, John and features the first known outings of The Death Of Emmett Till and Standing On The Highway The 11 songs performed are liberally interspersed with chat between Bob and Cynthia, however, far from spoiling the show, this only go to enhance one of the best early recordings we have of Bob Dylan, making this CD an incredibly important early document.' from amazon.co.uk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f688be48b659f0949f26ac3250b4f14d11b0325b","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Folksinger%27s+Choice+-+Interview+With+Cynthia+Gooding","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f688be48b659f0949f26ac3250b4f14d11b0325b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,136,190,72,182,89,240,148,159,38,172,50,80,180,241,77,17,176,50,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
