Later, Rhayader is killed in battle during the evacuation of Dunkirk. \r\n\r\nThe goose returned during the battle, and it is then named La Princesse Perdue, symbolizing the hopes that can still survive even during the evils of war. With such a complex fable to tell, it is no surprise that Camel keep their improvisational tendencies reined in, deciding to concentrate on surging, intricate soundscapes that telegraph the emotion of the piece without a single word. And even though The Snow Goose is an instrumental album, it is far more accessible than some of Camel's later work, since it relies on beautiful sonic textures instead of musical experimentation.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01.
