Not as polished as later versions, but illuminated by the inimitable Paul Robeson, as well as Ecce Homo Toto (how'd you like that for a name?). \n\nIMPORTANT: This is in gvi format - I got it from the old google video. It will play on VLC (or equivalent) BUT NOT in WMP or Real Player. If you want to burn it, you will probably have to convert it to a different format (using SUPER or suchlike).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d6935df34e110c2e5b63a83439b4522162725e","amp;dn":"King+Solomon%27s+Mines+%281937%29+Paul+Robeson+Cedric+Hardwicke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d6935df34e110c2e5b63a83439b4522162725e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,214,147,93,243,78,17,12,46,91,99,168,52,57,180,82,33,98,114,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
