Months later, several health professionals faced criminal allegations that they deliberately injected numerous patients with drugs to hasten their deaths. \n\nFive Days at Memorial, the culmination of six years of reporting, unspools the mystery of what happened in those days, bringing the reader into a hospital fighting for its life and into a conversation about the most terrifying form of health care rationing.\n\nIn a voice at once involving and fair, masterful and intimate, Fink exposes the hidden dilemmas of end-of-life care and reveals just how ill-prepared we are in America for the impact of large-scale disastersÃ¢â‚¬â€and how we can do better.  A remarkable book, engrossing from start to finish, Five Days at Memorial radically transforms your understanding of human nature in crisis.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a140fe4ed220df5ab24a1b5f0d455dfeddb96409","amp;dn":"Five+Days+at+Memorial%3A+Life+and+Death+in+a+Storm-Ravaged+Hospita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a140fe4ed220df5ab24a1b5f0d455dfeddb96409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,64,254,78,210,32,223,90,178,74,27,95,13,69,93,254,221,185,100,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
