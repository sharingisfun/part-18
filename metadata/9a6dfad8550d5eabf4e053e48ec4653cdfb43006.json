This is because the course is meant to be done over a two-week period.\n\nThis is the pure Sedona Method, as the creator intended.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a6dfad8550d5eabf4e053e48ec4653cdfb43006","amp;dn":"Sedona+Method+Release+Technique+%281992%29+-+Sedona+Institute","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a6dfad8550d5eabf4e053e48ec4653cdfb43006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,109,250,216,85,13,94,171,244,224,83,228,142,196,101,60,223,180,48,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
