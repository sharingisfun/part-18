It began with a battle between the Bismarck and the British battleship Prince of Wales and the heavy cruiser Hood. The Hood was blown to pieces, while the battered Prince of Wales managed to escape. The British then focused all of their resources on hunting the might German battleship and eventually brought her down.\n\nTitle: The Bismarck 1941: Hunting Germanys Greatest Battleship\nAuthor: Angus Konstam\nPublisher: Osprey Publishing\nPublisher: Osprey Campaign\nISBN: 978 1849083836\nYear: 2011\nFormat: PDF (Scanned)\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
