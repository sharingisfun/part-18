The report noted that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the economies of the industrialized states will continue to rely heavily on oil, thus making it a strategically important resource.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As most oil will be produced in the Middle East, the US has Ã¢â‚¬Å“motive for maintaining stability in and good relations with Middle Eastern statesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The geographic area of proven oil reserves coincides with the power base of much of the Salafi-jihadist network. This creates a linkage between oil supplies and the long war that is not easily broken or simply characterizedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ For the foreseeable future, world oil production growth and total output will be dominated by Persian Gulf resourcesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The region will therefore remain a strategic priority, and this priority will interact strongly with that of prosecuting the long war.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn this context, the report identified several potential trajectories for regional policy focused on protecting access to Gulf oil supplies, among which the following are most salient:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Divide and Rule focuses on exploiting fault lines between the various Salafi-jihadist groups to turn them against each other and dissipate their energy on internal conflicts. This strategy relies heavily on covert action, information operations (IO), unconventional warfare, and support to indigenous security forcesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the United States and its local allies could use the nationalist jihadists to launch proxy IO campaigns to discredit the transnational jihadists in the eyes of the local populaceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ US leaders could also choose to capitalize on the Ã¢â‚¬ËœSustained Shia-Sunni ConflictÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ trajectory by taking the side of the conservative Sunni regimes against Shiite empowerment movements in the Muslim worldÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. possibly supporting authoritative Sunni governments against a continuingly hostile Iran.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nExploring different scenarios for this trajectory, the report speculated that the US may concentrate Ã¢â‚¬Å“on shoring up the traditional Sunni regimes in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Pakistan as a way of containing Iranian power and influence in the Middle East and Persian Gulf.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Noting that this could actually empower al-Qaeda jihadists, the report concluded that doing so might work in western interests by bogging down jihadi activity with internal sectarian rivalry rather than targeting the US:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“One of the oddities of this long war trajectory is that it may actually reduce the al-Qaeda threat to US interests in the short term. The upsurge in Shia identity and confidence seen here would certainly cause serious concern in the Salafi-jihadist community in the Muslim world, including the senior leadership of al-Qaeda. As a result, it is very likely that al-Qaeda might focus its efforts on targeting Iranian interests throughout the Middle East and Persian Gulf while simultaneously cutting back on anti-American and anti-Western operations.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe RAND document contextualised this disturbing strategy with surprisingly prescient recognition of the increasing vulnerability of the USÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key allies and enemies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, Egypt, Syria, Iran Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to a range of converging crises: rapidly rising populations, a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœyouth bulgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, internal economic inequalities, political frustrations, sectarian tensions, and environmentally-linked water shortages, all of which could destabilise these countries from within or exacerbate inter-state conflicts.\n\nThe report noted especially that Syria is among several Ã¢â‚¬Å“downstream countries that are becoming increasingly water scarce as their populations growÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, increasing a risk of conflict. Thus, although the RAND document fell far short of recognising the prospect of an Ã¢â‚¬ËœArab SpringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, it illustrates that three years before the 2011 uprisings, US defence officials were alive to the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing instabilities, and concerned by the potential consequences for stability of Gulf oil.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff469ed8b6c81e305e217bf6bed1cb2bfcffb4c6","amp;dn":"2008+US+Army-funded+RAND+report%2C+Unfolding+the+Future+of+the+Lon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff469ed8b6c81e305e217bf6bed1cb2bfcffb4c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,70,158,216,182,200,30,48,94,33,123,246,190,209,203,43,252,255,180,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
