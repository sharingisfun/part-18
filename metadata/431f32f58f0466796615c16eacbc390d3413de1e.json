While it displays a more powerful guitar sound on &quot;Get Up,&quot; &quot;Turn You Inside Out,&quot; and &quot;Orange Crush,&quot; it also takes more detours than Document, whether it's the bizarrely affecting contemporary folk of &quot;The Wrong Child&quot; and &quot;You Are the Everything,&quot; the bubblegum of &quot;Stand&quot; and &quot;Pop Song 89,&quot; or the introspection of the lovely &quot;Hairshirt&quot; and &quot;World Leader Pretend.&quot; But instead of presenting a portrait of a band with a rich, eclectic vision, Green is incoherent. While its best moments are flat-out great, the band has bitten off more than it can chew; many of the songs sound like failed experiments, and its arena-ready production now sounds slightly dated. Nevertheless, half of the record is brilliant, and it certainly indicates that R.E.M. are continuing to diversify their sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:431f32f58f0466796615c16eacbc390d3413de1e","amp;dn":"R.E.M.+-+Green+%2825th+Anniversary+Edition%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"431f32f58f0466796615c16eacbc390d3413de1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,31,50,245,143,4,102,121,102,21,193,110,172,188,57,13,52,19,222,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
