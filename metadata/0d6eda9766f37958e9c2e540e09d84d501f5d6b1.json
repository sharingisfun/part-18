The story takes the time (3 hours) to develop its characters properly, with all sorts of tangles along the way. he hostility of the community gives it a sharp edge.\n\nA lot of people have wondered why this isn't available, well here it is. Don't watch unless you have a taste for character-driven detective fiction.\n\nThis is in segmented mpg format, it should play fine on VLC and suchlike. I have classified this TV miniseries as &quot;movie&quot; because it is packaged. Includes an introduction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d6eda9766f37958e9c2e540e09d84d501f5d6b1","amp;dn":"The+Ice+House+%28BBC-TV%2C1997%29+Redgrave+Craig+Aldridge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d6eda9766f37958e9c2e540e09d84d501f5d6b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,110,218,151,102,243,121,88,233,194,229,64,224,157,132,213,1,245,214,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
