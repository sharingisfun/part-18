His love affair with music began early. By the time he was 5, Azar was already entertaining, performing concerts around the house. His mother recalls his favorite toy wasn&amp;#039;t a truck or a tricycle but a tiny guitar. \n\nIn 1982, Azar entered Delta State University, intending to major in pre-med with an emphasis on chemistry. Three years later, however, he switched his major to management, although his interested had shifted to music.\n\nAzar and formed a band with his brother Joe and developed a fiercely loyal following throughout the Southeast. The band logged over 200 shows a year, burning up the miles from Florida to Tennessee. On two consecutive New Year&amp;#039;s Eves, the Steve Azar Band played for over 70,000 people jammed into Memphis&amp;#039; Overton Square.\n\nAfter seven years on the road, Azar decided it was time to try for a label deal. He made the move to Nashville in 1993 at the urging of his friend, PGA champ, Jim Gallagher. He signed a publishing deal, then signed a label deal with River North Records, although after one album, the label closed.\n\nAzar continued to tour and signed another deal with Mercury Nashville. He scored a major hit in 2001 with &quot;I Don&amp;#039;t Have to Be Me (&amp;#039;Til Monday),&quot; but parted ways with the label before issuing a second album for them.\n\nHe returned to touring, but by the summer of 2004, he realized that he needed surgery to correct a hemorrhaging cyst in his throat. After healing, he signed with an independent label, which is expected to release the album Indianola in 2006. \n\n+----------------+------------------------------------------+----------------+\n|                                                                            |\n|   Artist  : Steve Azar                                                     |\n|   Album   : Indianola-(Advance)                                            |\n|   Bitrate : VBR kbps                                                       |\n|                                                                            |\n+-------------------------------[Release Info]-------------------------------+\n|                                                                            |\n|   Label      : Midas                                                       |\n|   Year       : 2008                                                        |\n|   Genre      : Country                                                     |\n|   Rip date   : Apr-29-2008                                                 |\n|   Store date : May-27-2008                                                 |\n|   Size       : 82,1 MB                                                     |\n|                                                                            |\n+--------------------------------[Track List]--------------------------------+\n|                                                                            |\n|Track Listing:                                                              |\n|                                                                            |\n| 01 - Crowded                                   03:15                       |\n| 02 - You Don&amp;#039;t Know A Thing                    04:05                       |\n| 03 - You&amp;#039;re My Life                            04:10                       |\n| 04 - Still Tryin To Find My Way Around         03:43                       |\n| 05 - Empty Spaces                              04:34                       |\n| 06 - Whats Wrong With Right Now                03:36                       |\n| 07 - The Rivers Workin                         06:03                       |\n| 08 - I Won&amp;#039;t Let You Lead Me Down              03:56                       |\n| 09 - The Coach                                 04:11                       |\n| 10 - Prelude (Home)                            02:19                       |\n| 11 - Flatlands                                 04:59                       |\n| 12 - Bluestune feat.
