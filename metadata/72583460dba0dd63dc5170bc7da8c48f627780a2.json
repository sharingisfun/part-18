The unerring visions of life in The Water Method Man led the Los Angeles Times to call John Irving ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa true artist... not afraid to take on great themes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Now, after a long hiatus, he has released a novel filled with his trademark talent for spinning marvelously convoluted tales. Ruth Cole is four years old when she hears gasping sounds coming from her motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s room one night. Walking through their large house in the Hamptons, Ruth passes familiar photographs of two brothers who died before she was born. When Ruth opens the bedroom door, she sees a sight that will be etched in her memory more than those photosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½her mother with Eddie, the 16-year-old summer helper. A Widow for One Year is the story of RuthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unconventional, tragicomic life. As Ruth grows up to become an important author, her years include stories of Eddie, the photographs, the grand house, and her mother. Astonishing in its scope, A Widow for One Year resounds with emotional force and eccentric characters.\n - - -\n\nAwards:\n -  Audie Award Winner\n -  AudioFile Earphones Award\n -  A New York Times Notable Book of the Year\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72583460dba0dd63dc5170bc7da8c48f627780a2","amp;dn":"A+WIDOW+FOR+ONE+YEAR+-+John+Irving.+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72583460dba0dd63dc5170bc7da8c48f627780a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,88,52,96,219,160,221,99,220,81,112,188,125,168,196,143,98,119,128,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
