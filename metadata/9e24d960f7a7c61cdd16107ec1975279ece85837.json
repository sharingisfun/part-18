Offered a bundle to assassinate an American industrialist, he opts to warn the intended victim instead ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a good deed that soon takes a bad turn. Quicker than he can down a shot of his favorite whiskey, Lang is bashing heads with a Buddha statue, matching wits with evil billionaires, and putting his life (among other things) in the hands of a bevy of femmes fatales. Up against rogue CIA agents, wannabe terrorists, and an arms dealer looking to make a high-tech killing, Lang's out to save the leggy lady he has come to love...and prevent an international bloodbath to boot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e24d960f7a7c61cdd16107ec1975279ece85837","amp;dn":"Gun+Seller%2C+The+-+Hugh+Laurie-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e24d960f7a7c61cdd16107ec1975279ece85837","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,36,217,96,247,167,198,28,221,22,16,126,193,151,82,121,236,232,88,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
