You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive data.\n\nTo get past security, you'll need to make creative use of your main gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through.\n\nKey Features\nRewire levels to work however you want\nTrick guards into trapping themselves or shooting each other\nThrow yourself - and others - through plate glass windows\nInvestigate a noir-inspired story of murder and espionage over 20 missions\nChoose what to tell your clients, including lying to trick them\nChoose your own playstyle: quick, quiet, non-violent, no living witnesses, or any combination\nDiscover new solutions to levels that no-one else has thought of\nBuy specialist gadgets to suit how you want to play\nAll story stuff is skippable\nHardest puzzles are optional\nNo bosses - everyone dies in one shot, including you.\n\nSystem Requirements\nMinimum:\n\nOS:Windows XP\nProcessor:2GHz dual core\nMemory:2 GB RAM\nDirectX-Ã‚Â«:9.0\nHard Drive:150 MB HD space\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstallation\n\n1.
