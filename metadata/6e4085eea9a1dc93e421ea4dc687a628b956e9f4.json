Assembled in Los Angeles in 1966 by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968, the musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork, and Englishman Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner.\n\nAt the time of the group's formation, its producers saw The Monkees as a Beatles-like band. At the start, the band members provided vocals, but were given only limited performing and production opportunities. They eventually fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The group undertook several concert tours, allowing an opportunity to perform as a live band as well as on the TV series. Although the show was canceled in 1968, the band continued to record music through 1970. The group reached the height of fame from 1966 to 1968, and influenced many future artists. In 1986, their 20th year, the television show and music experienced a revival, which led to a series of reunion tours, and new records featuring various incarnations of the band's lineup.\n\nThe Monkees had a number of international hits which are still heard on pop and oldies stations. These include &quot;(Theme From) The Monkees&quot;, &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, &quot;I'm A Believer&quot;, &quot;(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone&quot;, &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot; and &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;. Their albums and singles have sold over 65 million copies worldwide.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MONKEES Original Album Series (2009 UK issue 89-track 5-CD album set comprised of the best selling and critically acclaimed album releases ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“HeadquartersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The MonkeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“More Of The MonkeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn And JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“TheBirds, The Bees And The MonkeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢; each album is housed in a mini LP-style card picture sleeve with the complete set presented in a sealed card slipcase).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nThe Monkees - The Monkees (1966):\n\n01.
