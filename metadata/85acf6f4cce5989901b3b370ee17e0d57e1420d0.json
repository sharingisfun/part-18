Just as well, their name kept them in the 1970s.  But this album is without question the greatest live album ever.  Warner Brothers doesn&amp;#039;t even market it any more, you have to go to Japan to get it (which I did -- thanks, EBay).  It cost be $75 but it&amp;#039;s worth the cost.  You guys enjoy it for nothing.  And smoke some doobie.\n\n\nThis album contains:\n\nSlippery St. Paul\n\nTakin&amp;#039; It to the Streets\n\nJesus Is Just Alright\n\nMinute By Minute\n\nCan&amp;#039;t Let It Get Away\n\nEchoes of Love\n\nWhat a Fool Believes\n\nBlack Water\n\nYou Belong to Me\n\nSlat Key Soquel Rag\n\nSteamer Lane Breakdown\n\nSouth City Midnight Lady\n\nOlana\n\nDon&amp;#039;t Start Me Talkin&amp;#039;\n\nLong Train Runnin&amp;#039;\n\nChina Grove\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85acf6f4cce5989901b3b370ee17e0d57e1420d0","amp;dn":"The+Doobie+Brothers+--+Farewell+Tour+%28extremely+rare%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85acf6f4cce5989901b3b370ee17e0d57e1420d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,172,246,244,204,229,152,153,1,179,179,112,238,23,224,213,126,20,32,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
