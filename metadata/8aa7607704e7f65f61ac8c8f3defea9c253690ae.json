The place is the Cabinet Room of the Where House. An unexpected accident and the law of succession have just made Douglass Dilman the first black President of the United States.\n\nThis is the theme of what was surely one of the most provocative novels of the 1960s. It takes the reader into the storm center of the presidency, where Dilman, until now an almost unknown senator, must bear the weight of three burdens: his office, his race, and his private life.\n\nFrom beginning to end, &quot;The Man is a novel of swift and tremendous drama, as President Dilman attempts to uphold his oath in the face of international crises, domestic dissension, violence, scandal, and ferocious hostility. Push comes to shove in a breathtaking climax, played out in the full glare of publicity, when the Senate of the United States meets for the first time in one hundred years to impeach the President.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa7607704e7f65f61ac8c8f3defea9c253690ae","amp;dn":"The+Man+by+Irving+Wallace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa7607704e7f65f61ac8c8f3defea9c253690ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,167,96,119,4,231,246,95,97,172,140,143,61,239,234,156,37,54,144,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
