Close to 1,500 pages in toto - mostly monochrome, mostly visually exquisite, many with astonishing and astonishingly effective paneling layouts.\n\nFull outline: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_%28comics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_%28comics%29&lt;/a&gt;  (do beware spoilers)\n\nVOLUMES I-II, III, IV (SIN-EATER, KING OF THE CATS, TALISMAN) - Repackaged versions of the digital TPBs posted by &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/LeonardTSpock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/LeonardTSpock&lt;/a&gt;  . Each of those contains &quot;Author's Notes&quot; as back matter, which are meant to be read alongside the comic proper, being predominantly elaborations on minutiae in individual panels. Since it is a lot more convenient to flip between two digital comics than to page-jump back and forth within one, these Notes are presented separately here.\n\nVOLUMES V, VI, VII, VIII (DREAM SEQUENCE, MYSTERY DATE, THE RESCUERS, FIVE CRAZY WOMEN) - Repackaged version of the &quot;Library Volume Two&quot;, again recently posted by LeonardTSpock. I found that release rather unwieldy; here, it has been broken down into its component tales, each bookended with the corresponding covers and bonus artwork from the &quot;Gallery&quot; section. Again, the Notes are supplied separately.\n\nVOLUME IX (VOICE) - Repackaged release by G85-Empire, once again with separate Notes.\n\nVOLUME X (THIRD WORLD) - My own version, manually assembled from Empire's digital releases of issues 1 thru 21 of the &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; anthology, in which this instalment was originally published in serialized form. First and only volume in full colour, unfortunately without any Notes at all - for now, at any rate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d5838ac6f8239136a9439ec9dceff7ebb0aa362","amp;dn":"The+Collected+%2B+Annotated+Finder+%28Dark+Horse%7C2000-%26gt%3B%7CDigital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d5838ac6f8239136a9439ec9dceff7ebb0aa362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,88,56,172,111,130,57,19,106,148,57,236,157,206,255,126,187,10,163,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
