The single-disc collection was the alternative to Ross' 1993 four CD box set, Forever Diana: Musical Memoirs, which was a 30th anniversary commemorative of her hit making years in three decades including work with The Supremes. This collection was similar featuring both Supremes hits and solo hits.  It became Ross' best-selling album in the UK selling over 1,200,000 copies certifying the album quadruple platinum there and peaked at number one on the UK album charts for 2 weeks, not in sequential order dominating the holiday week of 1993. The success of this release in the U.K. meant that Diana would embark on her most extensive tour of Great Britain after 30 years of touring in that market since her maiden tour with The Supremes on &quot;&quot;The Motortown Revue&quot;&quot; in 1963. The tour soldout 29 concerts on that continent alone. (In fact, Diana and her then husband, Arne Naess resided in London for most of the early 90s as the shipping magnate's corporate entities were based there).  After this album's release, Ross was deemed the best-selling female artist in music history by The Guinness Book of Records.\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Where Did Our Love Go\n[02] Baby Love\n[03] You Can't Hurry Love\n[04] Reflections\n[05] Reach Out And Touch\n[06] Ain't No Mountain High Enough\n[07] Touch Me In The Morning\n[08] Love Hangover\n[09] I'm Still Waiting\n[10] Upside Down\n[11] Theme From Mohogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To?)\n[12] Endless Love\n[13] Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n[14] Chain Reaction\n[15] When You Tell Me That You Love Me\n[16] One Shining Moment\t\n[17] If We Hold On Together\n[18] The Best Years Of My Life\n[19] Your Love\n[20] Lets Make Every Moment Count\n\n\tCD Play Time - 01h:13m:19s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 474mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
