You can search user name uraniumwilly and you should find it and other cracked versions seem to making the rounds suddenly. But you will need it!):\n\nPrism\nMikro Prism\nSkanner\nRazor\nSpark\nThe Finger\nThe Mouth\nMolekular\nMonark\nUltraloop\n\nThey are all working on my WIN 7 right now just fine. Up to you to figure out how they work and make music with them. Good luck. \n\nI live in China and my net can be bad at times, but things will go through. Hopefully some people with better connections will get this and get seeding ASAP as these are really wonderful music tools. \n\nNOTE: As far as I can figure you will have to drop your own loops into The Finger and Molekular to get them to make sounds. Drop some loops you have and then start mutating them all to hell. \n\nEnjoy\n\nUranium Willy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1581b05ca4f74c1bd98b0cea004c40f4dfb04b0","amp;dn":"Native+Instruments+Reakor5+Players+-+Updated+-+Uranium+Willy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1581b05ca4f74c1bd98b0cea004c40f4dfb04b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,88,27,5,202,79,116,193,189,152,176,206,160,4,196,15,77,251,4,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
