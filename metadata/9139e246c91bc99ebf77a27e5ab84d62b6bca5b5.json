Rohmer liked the film, too: in his 1961 essay &quot;The Taste for Beauty,&quot; he compared Les godelureaux favorably with Shadows and cited it as a modern film proving that the cinema is the equal of the older, established arts. Though Chabrol himself thought Les godelureaux &quot;futile,&quot; it has a self-contradicting vitality that it shares with no other film; darkly funny, poignant, and disturbing, this rarely seen work seems to draw an end to an era (the mythical period of the beginning of the French New Wave, glorying in possibility) and herald a new age of uncertainties and compromises.\n\nText by Chris Fujiwara : http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/the-unseen-chabrol-pt-3-20101111\n\nMany thanks to the original uploader, galmuchet\n\nVIDEO\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nDuration                                 : 1h 37mn\nBit rate                                 : 1 153 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 608 pixels\nHeight                                   : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 3:2\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\nAUDIO\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9139e246c91bc99ebf77a27e5ab84d62b6bca5b5","amp;dn":"Les+Godelureaux+-+Claude+Chabrol+%281961%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9139e246c91bc99ebf77a27e5ab84d62b6bca5b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,57,226,70,201,27,201,158,191,119,162,126,90,184,77,98,182,188,165,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
