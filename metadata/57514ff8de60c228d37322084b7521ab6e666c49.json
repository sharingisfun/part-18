The guru of Sixties radicals, Alinsky urged his followers to be flexible and opportunistic and say anything to get power, which they can then use to destroy the existing society and its economic system. Alinsky died in 1972, but left behind an organization in Chicago dedicated to his malicious ideas. This team hired Barack Obama in 1986 when he was 23 and taught him how to organize for radical transformation.\n\nIn this insightful new booklet, Horowitz discusses AlinskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work in the 60s Ã¢â‚¬â€ and his advice to radicals to seize any weapon to advance their cause. This became the philosophy of Alinskyite organizations such as ACORN and to Alinsky disciple Van Jones, a self described Ã¢â‚¬Å“communistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who served as President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Green CzarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ until he was forced to resign when his extremist ideas became public.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57514ff8de60c228d37322084b7521ab6e666c49","amp;dn":"Barack+Obamas+Rules+for+Revolution-David+Horowitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57514ff8de60c228d37322084b7521ab6e666c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,81,79,248,222,96,194,40,211,115,34,8,75,117,33,171,110,102,108,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
