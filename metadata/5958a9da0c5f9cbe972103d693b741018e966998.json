Anthony Hopkins plays Stevens, the &quot;perfect&quot; butler to a prosperous British household of the 1930s. He is so unswervingly devoted to serving his master, a well-meaning but callow British lord (James Fox), that he shuts himself off from all emotions and familial relationships. New housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) tries to warm him up and awaken his humanity. But when duty calls, Stevens won't even attend his own dying father's last moments on earth. The butler also refuses to acknowledge the fact that his master is showing signs of pro-Nazi sentiments. Disillusioned by Hitler's duplicity, the master dies an embittered man, and only then does Stevens come to realize how his own silence has helped bring about this sad situation. Years later, regretting his lost opportunities in life, he tries once more to make contact with Miss Kenton, the only person who'd ever cared enough to seek out the human being inside the butler's cold veneer.\n\n   General\n      Complete name: the remains of the day (1993).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.48 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 8mn\n      Bit rate : 1636 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 17.8 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 8mn\n      Bit rate : 1053 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 288 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.215\n      StreamSize : 970 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 2h 8mn\n      Bit rate : 446 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, Subwoofer\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 411 MiB\n   Audio #2\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 2h 8mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 116 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.98r\n      Encoding settings : CBR\n\nIMDB: tt0107943\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, german, Italian, spanish and Portuguese subtitles (srt)\n\nDual-audio: film and commentaries\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by stefflbw; extras eliminated, subtitles added","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5958a9da0c5f9cbe972103d693b741018e966998","amp;dn":"James+Ivory+-+The+Remains+of+the+day+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5958a9da0c5f9cbe972103d693b741018e966998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,88,169,218,12,95,156,190,151,33,3,214,147,183,65,1,142,150,105,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
