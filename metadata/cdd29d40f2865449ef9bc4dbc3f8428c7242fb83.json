Jim Carrey reprises his role as the title character Ace Ventura, a detective who specializes in retrieval of tame or captive animals. This is the only sequel to a film starring Carrey in which Carrey reprised his role.[2] Ian McNeice, Simon Callow, and Sophie Okonedo co-star. Tommy Davidson, who co-starred with Carrey on the show In Living Color, makes a cameo appearance in the film.\n\nThe film was written and directed by Steve Oedekerk, who had also collaborated in the making of the earlier movie. Tom DeCerchio, the director of Celtic Pride, was originally slated to direct the film but left after shooting began.[3] The film has developed a large cult following since its release. It was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, Ace Ventura Jr: Pet Detective, in 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd29d40f2865449ef9bc4dbc3f8428c7242fb83","amp;dn":"Ace+Ventura+When+Nature+Calls+%5B1995%5D+DVD5+PAL+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd29d40f2865449ef9bc4dbc3f8428c7242fb83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,210,157,64,242,134,84,73,239,155,196,219,195,248,66,140,114,66,251,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
