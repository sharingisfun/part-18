The Byzantine liturgy heard regularly from the church opposite his family home, Cretan traditional music, with its rapid dances of repeated small motifs, played by local instruments at the townÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s weekly festivities, but at the same time the sound of the waves, and the detonation of land-mines in the aftermath of World War II, all these formed part of the acoustic universe of the composer as a child. \nHe took his first lessons in music theory and the violin at the local conservatory and played the clarinet in the municipal band. \nMeanwhile other musical experiences of decisive importance were classical music as well as the music of the wider Eastern Mediterranean and, most important of all, that of nearby Egypt, which he heard either over the radio or from musicians and travellers passing through his hometown. \nThanks to his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extensive private library he had the opportunity to deepen his knowledge, beyond school education, in literature, philosophy, history and the arts. He began composing music during his adolescence and two melodies of this time would later become songs that have enjoyed great popularity throughout GreeceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \n\nIn 1969 Markopoulos returned to Athens with a musical vision that would not only change the course of music in Greece but would also lend immediate moral support to the general demand for restoration of democracy, the struggle being led primarily by university students and intellectuals. \nHe founded a new and highly distinctive musical ensemble which included Greek local instruments. Thus the piano was combined with the lyre for the first time, while he also added instruments of his own invention, particularly among the percussion, with the intention of enriching the variety of sounds. He then selected young musicians, singers and actors, from both the city and the provinces, and collaborating with painters and poets he presented a series of performances with his musical works Ilios o Protos (Sun the First), Chroniko (Chronicle), Ithagenia (Nativeland), Thitia (Lifetime), Stratis Thalassinos Among the Agapanthi (poetry by Giorgos Seferis, Nobel Prize 1963), Oropedio (Mountain Plain) at the Lydra venue which he named music-studio. His most fervent supporters were indeed the students and intellectuals who filled the music-studio daily, despite the constant interventions of the regime that would constantly attempt to shut it down. The composerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision had materialised and a new musical wave had been born which he termed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReturn to the RootsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. He defined it as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa project for the future involving the process of examination, evaluation and selection of the indestructible sources of our living traditions in combination with selected contemporary art forms and elementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½: the outcome was an exceptionally original sound emerging from the unique tone colours stemming from the unaccustomed blends of instruments and voices.\n(wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\n01.
