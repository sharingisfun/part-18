Across 11 songs and one epic poem, Cope examines the idea of social outcasts and how they ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ through their sheer obstinacy and strength of personality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ carve a path for themselves in the normal world, often changing societyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own concepts of normality in the process. On BLACK SHEEP, Cope attributes his personal descent into outsider-dom to his 9th birthday on which 116 children his own age died in the infamous Aberfan Disaster. Cope also asserts that the West has been rigorously directed towards the outsider concept, first by the rejected ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Black SheepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ prophet Jesus Christ, whose own people ignored his revelation, and secondly by St. Paul, another ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Black SheepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ whose singular take on Christianity has come down to us through the Roman Empire. Available on two half-hour-long CDs and later on gatefold double-vinyl, the 11 songs of BLACK SHEEP reveal Cope at a pinnacle of songwriting and feature sumptuous lashings of orchestral Mellotron, orchestral percussion and marching bass drums, plus oboe, wah guitar, rumbling synthesizers and gorgeous harmony vocals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39624d38716c910d4d766cb143ef241fac778501","amp;dn":"Julian+Cope+-+Black+Sheep+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39624d38716c910d4d766cb143ef241fac778501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,98,77,56,113,108,145,13,77,118,108,177,67,239,36,31,172,119,133,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
