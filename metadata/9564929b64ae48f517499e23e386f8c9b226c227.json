Catherine (Deneuve) is the stunning wife of an equally uncaring husband, Howard's philandering boss Ted Gunther (Peter Lawford).\n\nAt a house party hosted by Ted, he urges Howard to pick up an available woman at the party and proceeds to show him how. Howard reluctantly tries it on Catherine, who instantly accepts.\n\nThe two find their marriages are loveless as they discover more about each other that night and decide to run away together. But Howard doesn't realise Catherine is his boss's wife until he is about to board the plane with her to Paris.\n\nNewly-promoted if none too happily married Howard Brubaker leaves a rowdy Company party early with the stunning Catherine, whom it turns out is herself unhappily married - to the boss. They spend an innocent night in New York becoming more and more attracted to each other, so that when Catherine announces she intends to leave her husband and return to Paris Howard asks to go along too. In the cold light of morning problems and pressures from spouses crowd in\n\nThe 1980 Rosenberg film Brubaker's title character is also named H. Brubaker, there played by Robert Redford.\nThe female lead was originally going to be played by Shirley MacLaine but she was not available due to commitments on Sweet Charity and campaigning for Robert F. Kennedy. Catherine Deneuve was cast instead.\nThe New York Times review said, &quot;The April Fools, written by Hal Dresner and directed by Stuart Rosenberg, manipulates its stereotypes with elegance and style. ... The best things in the movie, however, are the extraordinarily good supporting performances by Peter Lawford (Miss Deneuve's husband), Jack Weston, Harvey Korman, Sally Kellerman, and by two stars who invented movie elegance almost 30 years ago, Charles Boyer and Myrna Loy.&quot; \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 773 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 2.353:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 95 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9564929b64ae48f517499e23e386f8c9b226c227","amp;dn":"The+April+Fools+%281969%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Jack+Lemmon%2C+Catherine+Deneuve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9564929b64ae48f517499e23e386f8c9b226c227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,100,146,155,100,174,72,245,23,73,158,35,227,134,248,201,178,38,194,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
