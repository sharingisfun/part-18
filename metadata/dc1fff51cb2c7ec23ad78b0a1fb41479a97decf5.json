The old one had the torrent file itself in the files which caused an error that didnt let anyone get 100% (sorry it was my first torrent!).  Also they were the dcp version.  I searched far and wide and collected the Minutemen scans of all issues, assuring the highest quality scans and ad-free.  Ofcourse Minutemen scans are larger in size so this torrent is much bigger than the last.***\n\nThis is the complete collection of DC's Trinity comics.  The 2008-2009 series and the 2003 series.\n\nTrinity (2003) (3 Issues)\nBatman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity was a three issue comic book limited series published by DC Comics. Written and drawn by Matt Wagner, the series focused on the first meeting and first alliance between DC's Trinity: Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.  Will the combined might of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman be enough to save the world from the mad schemes of Ra's al Ghul?\n\nTrinity (2009) (52 Issues)\nOne of the differences between Trinity and earlier weekly comics is that it features two stories: the first, a 12-page lead story by Busiek and Mark Bagley, and the second, a 10-page backup by Busiek.  The story surrounds Krona, a Oan banished from reality billions of years ago.  Morgan Le Fey seeks to gain God-hood and recruits many villains to her cause.  Morgan uses Krona's &quot;creation energy&quot; to banish the Trinity (Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman) from our world and give herself god-like power.  The Trinity return with god-like powers of their own to combat Le Fey whilst a bigger problem arises in the return of Krona!  These 52 issues span the entire DC Universe and pays tribute to the big 3 in a big way.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1fff51cb2c7ec23ad78b0a1fb41479a97decf5","amp;dn":"Trinity+-+Complete+DC+Series+%282003+and+2008-2009+collections%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1fff51cb2c7ec23ad78b0a1fb41479a97decf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,31,255,81,203,44,126,194,58,215,139,10,31,180,20,121,169,125,236,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
