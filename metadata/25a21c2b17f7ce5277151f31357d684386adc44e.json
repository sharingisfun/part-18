It was the second album recorded with this lineup, following the successful self-titled Fleetwood Mac album. In December 1976, prior to the release of the album, Reprise released the single &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;. In 1978, it won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. As of 2007 the album has sold more than 30 million copies, and is the 13th on the list of best-selling albums of all time.\n\nThe album the band members released in 1977 was Rumours, in which the band members laid bare the emotional turmoil experienced at that time. Produced largely by Buckingham, it became the best-selling album of the year, spending over 6 months at the top of the U.S. chart, and was the recipient of the Grammy Award for Album Of The Year for 1977. Hit singles included Buckingham&amp;#039;s &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, Nicks&amp;#039;s &quot;Dreams&quot; (sample (info)), and Christine McVie&amp;#039;s &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Stop&quot; and &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;. Buckingham&amp;#039;s &quot;Second Hand News,&quot; Nicks&amp;#039;s &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and &quot;The Chain&quot; (the only song written by all five bandmates) also received a lot of radio airplay. By 2003, Rumours had sold over 19 million copies in the U.S. alone (certified as a diamond album by the RIAA), and a total of 30 million copies worldwide making it one of the biggest selling albums of all time.\n[/quote]\n\n\nTracks:\n\n&quot;Second Hand News&quot; (Lindsey Buckingham) ? 2:43 \n&quot;Dreams&quot; (Stevie Nicks) ? 4:14 \n&quot;Never Going Back Again&quot; (Buckingham) ? 2:14 \n&quot;Don&amp;#039;t Stop&quot; (Christine McVie) ? 3:11 \n&quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; (Buckingham) ? 3:38 \n&quot;Songbird&quot; (C.
