His success was assured when he told his very first &quot;no respect&quot; joke: &quot;I don&amp;#039;t get no respect. I played hide-and-seek, and they wouldn&amp;#039;t even look for meÃƒÂ¢??. Dangerfield would also tell conventional jokes in his act: &quot;I grew up in a tough neighborhood. Tough neighborhood! Teachers would get notes from parents saying, &amp;#039;Please excuse Johnny for the next 5 to 10 years!&amp;#039;&quot; Dangerfield became the surprise hit of the show.\n\nFinally established as a reliable stand-up comedian, he would write thousands more of these self-deprecating jokes. Dangerfield began headlining shows in Las Vegas and made frequent encore appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. He became a regular on The Dean Martin Show and appeared on The Tonight Show 70 times.\n\nHe bought a Manhattan nightclub in 1969 in order to remain near his children after their mother had died.&quot;Dangerfield&amp;#039;s&quot; was the venue for an HBO show which helped popularize many stand-up comics, including Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Tim Allen, Roseanne Barr, Jeff Foxworthy, Sam Kinison, Rita Rudner, Andrew Dice Clay and Bob Saget.\n\n \nRodney Dangerfield&amp;#039;s comedy album No Respect.His comedy album No Respect won a Grammy Award.\n\n\n\n\n\n===========================\n===========================\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat stand-up comic, even if it is hard to understand a New Yorker&amp;#039;s accent if you&amp;#039;re not American like me, lol. \n\nSome great gags, he&amp;#039;s a brilliant joke-writer.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n\nJimmy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7454156af35d4caaf6110bec448e559b18a93259","amp;dn":"Rodney+Dangerfield%2C+No+Respect+%5BComedy+Album%2C+mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7454156af35d4caaf6110bec448e559b18a93259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,84,21,106,243,93,76,170,246,17,11,236,68,142,85,155,24,169,50,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
