But the blaze was set by an arsonist, and it is unclear whether she or Dr. Shaw was the intended victimÃ¢â‚¬â€or did the doctor himself set the blaze in order to inherit his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s large fortune? Baffled by the scarcity of clues in this terrible crime, Inspector Thomas Pitt turns to the people who had been closest to the coupleÃ¢â‚¬â€ClemencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stuffy but distinguished relatives. Meanwhile, PittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wellborn wife, Charlotte, retraces the dangerous path that Clemency walked in the last months of her life, finding herself enmeshed in a sinister web that stretches from the lowest slums to the loftiest centers of power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5a527425207856f68a73b9e2e24475b69f80108","amp;dn":"Ann+Perry-Highgate+Rise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5a527425207856f68a73b9e2e24475b69f80108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,165,39,66,82,7,133,111,104,167,59,158,46,36,71,91,105,248,1,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
