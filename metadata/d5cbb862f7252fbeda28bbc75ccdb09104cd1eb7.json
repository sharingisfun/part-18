In 2002 GutiÃƒÂ©rrez was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 2003 he received the prestigious PrÃƒÂ­ncipe de Asturias award. He has also published in and been a member of the board of directors of the international journal, Concilium.\n\nGutierrez spent much of his life living and working among the poor and oppressed of Lima. He has studied medicine and literature (Peru), psychology and philosophy (Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium), and obtained a doctorate at the Institut Pastoral d'Etudes Religieuses (IPER), UniversitÃƒÂ© Catholique in Lyon.\n\nGutiÃƒÂ©rrez is of Native American heritage, being of mixed Quechua and Spanish descent. GutiÃƒÂ©rrez's groundbreaking work, A Theology of Liberation: History, Politics, Salvation (1971), explains his notion of Christian poverty as an act of loving solidarity with the poor as well as a liberatory protest against poverty.ok, Jesus before Christianity, in which he presented an account of Jesus' radical involvement in the struggle for full humanity in the context of first-century Palestine: he &quot;challenged the rich to identify in solidarity with the poor, a spirituality of solidarity that resonated with white Catholics seeking a new, progressive direction&quot; (Egan 1999). The book was translated into nine languages, and a 15th anniversary edition appeared in the early 1990s.\n\nNolan published his second major work, God in South Africa in 1988. At one point during the writing process he 'went underground' to hide from the Security Forces during the State of Emergency in South Africa. God in South Africa is a primary example of contextual theology: written as a theology for that particular moment, without a claim to its possible relevance in other times and places. In 2006, Nolan published his Jesus Today: A Spirituality of Radical Freedom (Orbis Books).\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5cbb862f7252fbeda28bbc75ccdb09104cd1eb7","amp;dn":"A+Theology+of+Liberation+%5Bmp3%5D+Gutierrez+-+ScanSoft+Daniel+readi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5cbb862f7252fbeda28bbc75ccdb09104cd1eb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,203,184,98,247,37,47,190,218,40,187,199,92,205,176,145,4,205,30,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
