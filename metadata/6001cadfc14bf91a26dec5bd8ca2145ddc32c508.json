An expert in human behavior. And when she began an affair with sexy, charming graduate student Ethan Wolfe, she knew she was playing with fire. Consumed by lust when they were together, riddled with guilt when they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, she knows the three-month fling with her teaching assistant has to end. After all, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finally engaged to a kind and loving investment banker who adores her, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taking control of her life. But when she attempts to end the affair, Ethan Wolfe wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let her walk away.\n\n. . . no one else can.\n\nEthan has plans for Sheila, plans that involve posting a sex video that would surely get her fired and destroy her prestigious career. Plans to make her pay for rejecting him. And as she attempts to counter his every threatening move without her colleagues or her fiancÃƒÂ© discovering her most intimate secrets, a shattering crime rocks Puget Sound State University: a female student, a star athlete, is found stabbed to death. Someone is raising the stakes of violence, sex, and blackmail . . . and before she knows it, Sheila is caught in a terrifying cat-and-mouse game with the lover she couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resistÃ¢â‚¬â€who is now the monster who wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let her go.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                              Published - July 5th 2011\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6001cadfc14bf91a26dec5bd8ca2145ddc32c508","amp;dn":"Creep+by+Jennifer+Hillier+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6001cadfc14bf91a26dec5bd8ca2145ddc32c508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,1,202,223,193,75,249,26,38,222,197,189,140,162,20,93,220,50,197,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
