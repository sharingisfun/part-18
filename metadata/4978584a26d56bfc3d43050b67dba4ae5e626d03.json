Beagle, Darwin spends a mere five weeks in the GalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡pagos islands and, contrary to conventional belief, his greatest epiphanies do not occur on the famed islands. Instead, they are a cultivation of years exploring the wilds of South America where forests become the cathedral of DarwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s religion. Encountering a world like heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never seen before, DarwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s senses are overwhelmed by a world teeming with life, but what he finds along the way is perplexing to a 19th century naturalist. He questions why do the fossils he discovers look like giant versions of the sloths and armadillos still living nearby; why do the penguins and other birds he sees use their wings as flippers, fins or sails ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but not for flying; how could sea shells be found embedded in rock layers more than 100 miles from the sea? It is not until after he leaves the GalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡pagos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ where mockingbirds, not finches capture his attention ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that he is able to fully appreciate everything he has encountered and pull together his masterwork: The Origin of Species. * http://www.natgeochannel.co.uk/Programmes/darwins-lost-voyage\n\nCapped on National Geographic HD\n46:56\nH.264\n2 Channel Audio\n\nThanks!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4978584a26d56bfc3d43050b67dba4ae5e626d03","amp;dn":"Darwin%5C%27s+Lost+Voyage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4978584a26d56bfc3d43050b67dba4ae5e626d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,120,88,74,38,213,107,252,61,67,5,11,103,219,164,174,94,98,109,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
