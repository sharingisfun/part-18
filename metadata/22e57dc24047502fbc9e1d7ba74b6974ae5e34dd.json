So, just don't tell anyone you still think it's a riot to watch John Belushi as the brutish Bluto slurp Jell-O or terrorize his less-aggressive fellow students. This crude parody of college life in the '60s spawned many imitations, but none could match the fresh-faced talent or bad taste of this huge box office success. This was the first of the National Lampoon movies. Keep an eye out for a very young Kevin Bacon in his first credited screen appearance.\n\n  Starring: John Belushi, Tim Matheson, John Vernon, Peter Reigert, Karen Allen, Verna Bloom, Tom Hulce, Donald Sutherland.\n\n  Directed by: John Landis.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 49min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e57dc24047502fbc9e1d7ba74b6974ae5e34dd","amp;dn":"Animal+House+%281978%29+%28John+Belushi%2C+Tim+Matheson%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e57dc24047502fbc9e1d7ba74b6974ae5e34dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,229,125,194,64,71,80,47,188,158,29,123,167,75,105,116,174,94,52,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
