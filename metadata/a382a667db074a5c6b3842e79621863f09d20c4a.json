Endo et al. (Pergamon, 1996).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0080426824\r\n\r\nCarbon nanotubes have been studied extensively in relation to fullerenes, and together with fullerenes have opened a new science and technology field on nano scale materials.\r\n\r\nA whole range of issues from the preparation, structure, properties and observation of quantum effects in carbon nanotubes in comparison with 0-D fullerenes are discussed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, complementary reviews on carbon nanoparticles such as carbon nano-capsules, onion-like graphite particles and metal-coated fullerenes are covered.\r\n\r\nThis book aims to cover recent research and development in this area, and so provide a convenient reference tool for all researchers in this field. It is also hoped that this book can serve to stimulate future work on carbon nanotubes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a382a667db074a5c6b3842e79621863f09d20c4a","amp;dn":"Carbon+Nanotubes+-+M.+Endo+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a382a667db074a5c6b3842e79621863f09d20c4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,130,166,103,219,7,74,92,107,56,66,231,150,33,134,63,9,210,12,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
