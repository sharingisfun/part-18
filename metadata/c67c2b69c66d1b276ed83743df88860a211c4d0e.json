Straddling the line between hard rock and prog, there&amp;#039;s a little something here to appease fans of both styles. Keyboards apparently just piano and organ, with the latter being especially hot-wired to make the keyboardist&amp;#039;s style resemble Frumpy keyboardist Jean-Jacques KRAVETZ, or perhaps Dave STEWART at his most maniacal (see &quot;Dreams Wide Awake&quot; for an example). He can lash out at his organ with a recklessness that puts EMERSON to shame, listen to the solo on &quot;Post War, Saturday Echo&quot; if you don&amp;#039;t believe me. Bass player John GUSTAFSON (pre-ROXY MUSIC) sings in a uncontrolled, manic voice that can often sound gut-wrenching. A couple of tracks (the ballad &quot;Good Lord Knows&quot; and the lengthy jam-orientated &quot;Laughin&amp;#039; Tackle&quot; include massed strings. In the 90s there suddenly was a QUATERMASS II, but their music seems to have very little to do with the original band. The latest CD is called &quot;The Long Road&quot;\n\n\n\nStudio Album, released in 1970\nTrack Listings\n\n1. Entropy (1:10)\n2. Black sheep in the family (3:36)\n3. Post war Saturday echo (9:42)\n4.
