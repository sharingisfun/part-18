Oh please don't seed pop video's that are so compressed no one can use them.   Not everyone is hard up for disc space or bandwidth and the amount of rubbish that is being uploaded is cluttering the net and wasting our time.\n\nGolden Rule, if your pop video is under 100 Mb in size you had better know what the heck you are doing as more than likley it will look rubbish on a flat screen monitor unless you are dammed good at ripping.  MKV Xvid and AVI files can look good but many do not.\n\nWHY bother compressing them in the first place Duh....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dc2601b326938bf0692c16b19ca80abdb66bffd","amp;dn":"Best+of+1994+Promo+Only+%28Vob+files%29+%5BVideo+Album%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dc2601b326938bf0692c16b19ca80abdb66bffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,194,96,27,50,105,56,191,6,146,193,107,25,202,128,171,219,102,191,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
