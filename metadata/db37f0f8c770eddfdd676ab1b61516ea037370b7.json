When Noel hires the marketing company where Lane is an intern, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forced to see him again. If she wants to land her dream job as executive within the company, she has to win him over and secure his account.

But NoelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s countless trysts with groupies and his cocky attitude make Lane believe he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the same guy she once lovedÃ¢â‚¬â€now he seems to only want her body. Then after Lane discloses she needs him to procure a job, Noel proves heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a changed man by forcing her to go on the road with him in order to get it.\n\nAfter Lane reluctantly takes Noel up on his offer, she becomes willing to do whatever it takes to keep him satisfied, even if it means succumbing to his seductive ways.

She soon discovers that father doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always know best when it comes to matters of the heart. \n\nWhen Zach meets AubreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immediately faced with his deepest fear: The love he so desperately wants, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deserve. The Judge makes no attempt to hide his disdain for Zach, and will stop at nothing to keep him away from his daughter. But an unexpected twist turns everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plans upside down and no oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world will ever be the same. \n\nOutside forces attempting to pull them apart are strong and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to take every bit of Zach and AubreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love for one another to withstand the fall-out.
