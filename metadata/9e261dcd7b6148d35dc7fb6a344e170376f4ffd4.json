But it's a bleak future where there are still wonders: man traveling out into the universe, Blade Runner-esque cities hanging from the ceilings of vast caverns, and aliens that we can barely comprehend. Gavin Smith writes fast-moving, incredibly violent sci-fi thrillers, but behind the violence and the thrills lies a carefully thought-out story and characters who have far more to them than first meets the eye. Never one to avoid controversy, Smith nevertheless invites readers to think beyond the initial shock of what they have just read. But in the meantime? Another fire fight, another chase, and another flight of imagination.\n\nProduct Details:\n\n\nSeries: Veteran\nPaperback: 560 pages\nPublisher: Gollancz (October 10, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0575094729\nISBN-13: 978-0575094727\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e261dcd7b6148d35dc7fb6a344e170376f4ffd4","amp;dn":"War+in+Heaven+by+Gavin+Smith+%5BePub%5D+%5B%3D%3DHxH%3D%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e261dcd7b6148d35dc7fb6a344e170376f4ffd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,38,29,205,123,97,72,211,93,199,251,106,52,78,23,3,118,244,255,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
