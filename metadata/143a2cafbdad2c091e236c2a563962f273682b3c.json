Starring Max Von Sydow, Orson Welles and Patrick O&amp;#039;Neal playing a naval man drafted into the Intelligence Community because he has a photographic memory and is able to speak fluent Russian.  He is given the task of retrieving an embarrasing letter between ambassadors that could start WWIII. Helping him is a motley team of undercover (and underworld) sorts, including Richard Boone as O&amp;#039;Neal&amp;#039;s superior, charming and menacing both at the same time, George Sanders as a drag artist, and a beautiful safecracker (who opens safes with her feet while lying on her back), played by Barbara Parkins, with whom O&amp;#039;Neal falls in love. The characterizations and the acting are first-rate and filming was mostly done in Helsinki.  Huston, who also plays a small role, directs with a deceptive touch of nonchalance that seems to imply wariness and uninvolvement but in fact, the film is a highly absorbing tale that sustains interest from beginning to end.  Ending has a helluva twist.   \n\nIf you miss the first five minutes, you miss one suicide, two executions, one seduction and the key to the plot!!!\n\n\n\nTagline: Don&amp;#039;t trust anyone in the Kremlin Letter\n\n\n\nIMDB record:      &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065950/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065950/&lt;/a&gt;      \n\n\n\nSeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed MF !!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:143a2cafbdad2c091e236c2a563962f273682b3c","amp;dn":"The-Kremlin-Letter-1970-ENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"143a2cafbdad2c091e236c2a563962f273682b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,58,44,175,189,173,44,9,30,35,108,42,86,57,98,242,115,104,43,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
