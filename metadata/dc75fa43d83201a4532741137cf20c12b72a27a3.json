Amarrah knew she had been there with themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and now their legacy, along with an ancient box that once belonged to them, lies in her hands.\n\nCharged with keeping the box safe, Amarrah is heartbroken when it is stolen from her while she moves to America. Years later, she is shocked to see it on TV and is determined to get it back. Tracking the artifact leads her to Sergeant Harrison Brockson, a handsome soldier who stirs memories of a man she knew centuries ago in ancient Babylon. Is Harrison the key to finding the boxÃ¢â‚¬â€or could he be her destiny?\n\nMark of the Witch (The Portal #1) by Maggie Shayne (September 18th 2012)\n\nA lapsed Wiccan, Indira Simon doesn't believe in magic anymore. But when strange dreams of being sacrificed to an ancient Babylonian god have her waking up with real rope burns on her wrists, she's forced to acknowledge that she may have been too hasty in her rejection of the unknown. Then she meets mysterious and handsome Father Tomas. Emerging from the secrecy of an obscure Gnostic sect, he arrives with stories of a demon, a trio of warrior witches-and Indira's sacred calling. Yet there's something even Tomas doesn't know, an inescapable truth that will force him to choose between saving the life of the woman he's come to love-and saving the world.\n\nDaughter of the Spellcaster (The Portal #2) by Maggie Shayne (November 20th 2012) \n\nHas a spell been cast?\n\nLena Dunkirk is a practicing witch, Ryan McNally a wealthy playboy. Logic says mismatch, yet from the first they share a passion that defies reason, as if they know each other from another place, another time. Then Lena gets pregnant and runs for the safety of home.\n\nMonths later, when Ryan appears at her door looking to help raise their child, Lena doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know whom to trustÃ¢â‚¬â€œparticularly now that Ã¢â‚¬Å“guru to the starsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bahru has taken an interest in her baby, offering gifts forged of magic.\n\nSoon she and Ryan are sharing eerie dreams of ancient lands, while a vengeful demon plots to take possession of their child. As the moment of birth approaches, the demonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power rises, forcing the hand of love to wield the blade that will decide the fate of a childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soulÃ¢â‚¬â€œand the future of the world.\n\nBlood of The Sorceress (The Portal #3) by Maggie Shayne (January 22nd 2013)\n\nTheir Love was destiny. Was a curse to be their undoing?\n\nAs an ancient kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite harem slave, Lilia committed the worst of all possible crimes: loving another man. When the king discovered her treason, her lover was sentenced to lose his soul and linger in eternal imprisonment, and Lilia herself was executed alongside her sisters. While they reincarnated through countless lifetimes, she lingered alone between worlds for thousands of years, waiting for the moment to rescue her beloved Demetrius.\n\nNow that moment has come. Demetrius has broken free, but without his soul and in the thrall of the same high priest who betrayed them so long ago; he has become an icy, uncaring cad, devoting himself solely to pleasure and power. Somehow Lilia must convince him to reclaim his humanity, to abandon the enemy tempting him to give in to his selfish desiresÃ¢â‚¬â€œor her life will be lost alongside his, both of them condemned to eternal damnation, eternal isolation, their love lost one final and irrevocable time.\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc75fa43d83201a4532741137cf20c12b72a27a3","amp;dn":"Portal+Trilogy+by+Maggie+Shayne+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc75fa43d83201a4532741137cf20c12b72a27a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,117,250,67,216,50,1,164,83,39,65,19,124,242,12,18,183,42,39,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
