Blue herself never sees themâ€”not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her.\r\n\r\nHis name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.\r\n\r\nBut Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she canâ€™t entirely explain. He has it allâ€”family money, good looks, devoted friendsâ€”but heâ€™s looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.\r\n\r\nFor as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem. But now, as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, sheâ€™s not so sure anymore.\r\n\r\nFrom Maggie Stiefvater, the bestselling and acclaimed author of the Shiver trilogy and The Scorpio Races, comes a spellbinding new series where the inevitability of death and the nature of love lead us to a place weâ€™ve never been before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Will Patton\r\nFormat: M4B\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a7fff19b2a1498a3737e7650c47428d1ddf6b5","amp;dn":"Maggie+Stiefvater+-+The+Raven+Boys+%28The+Raven+Cycle+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a7fff19b2a1498a3737e7650c47428d1ddf6b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,167,255,241,155,42,20,152,163,115,126,118,80,196,116,40,209,221,246,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
