Louis Missouri band Ludo.\n\nThe Broken Bride is a story of a man and how he deals with his loss of his love. Its a very unique concept album with some of the most amazing imagery. The genre is pop-punk but this EP doesn&amp;#039;t really fit the genre completely. Its much more epic. \n\nFor the complete story check out the Wiki &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Bride&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Bride&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1f6159f45425ee383eeb45ac9ad40626d4a0d7","amp;dn":"Ludo+Broken+Bride+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1f6159f45425ee383eeb45ac9ad40626d4a0d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,31,97,89,244,84,37,238,56,62,235,69,172,154,212,6,38,212,160,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
