That Free and Zeppelin were cut from the same cloth is immediately apparent, even before you start comparing the versions of &quot;The Hunter&quot; that highlight both bands' debut albums. Where Free streaks ahead, however, is in their refusal to compromise their own vision of the blues -- even at its most commercial (&quot;I'm a Mover&quot; and &quot;Worry&quot;), Tons of Sobs has a density that makes Zeppelin and the rest of the era's rocky contemporaries sound like flyweights by comparison.\n\nWith remastered sound that drives the record straight back to the studio master tapes, the sheer versatility of the players, and the unbridled imagination of producer Guy Stevens, rings crystal clear.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f5167fa4d6504972750dc3e655a3fd9b6646a4","amp;dn":"Free+-+Tons+Of+Sobs+%282014%29+Universal+Music+Japan+UICY40077+FLAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f5167fa4d6504972750dc3e655a3fd9b6646a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,245,22,127,164,214,80,73,114,117,13,195,230,85,163,253,155,102,70,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
