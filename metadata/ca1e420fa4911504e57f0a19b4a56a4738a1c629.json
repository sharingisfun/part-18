Today she's a vibrant 44-year-old actress who's confident and spunky and very happy with herself and with her life. The problem is that she's struggling to balance her private and public persona and hiding in a frumptastic wardrobe filled with oversized shapeless frocks. Stacy and Clinton show Mindy how her outside image doesn't match up with the confident, sunny woman on the inside. So how did one of television's most beloved kid actors fare?\n\nMediaInfo:\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 520 MiB\nDuration                         : 42mn 38s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 705 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf52.39.0\nWriting library                  : VirtualDub build 32842/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 42mn 38s\nBit rate                         : 1 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.607\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.186\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 42mn 38s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca1e420fa4911504e57f0a19b4a56a4738a1c629","amp;dn":"What.Not.To.Wear+s08e01+Mindy.Cohn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca1e420fa4911504e57f0a19b4a56a4738a1c629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,30,66,15,164,145,21,4,229,127,10,25,180,165,106,71,56,161,198,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
