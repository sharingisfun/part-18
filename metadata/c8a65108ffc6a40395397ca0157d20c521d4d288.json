The song is ostensibly an anti-cocaine anthem, but, in \ntrue form, the message gets a little mixed along the way. \n\nAt times on One Way Ticket to Hell...And Back, shades of Journey\nand Aerosmith can be heard (sometimes in the same song, as in &quot;Is It\nJust Me?&quot;). \n\nThat is the beauty of The Darkness you can't help but get swept up \nin the ride, and &quot;One Way Ticket To Hell...And Back&quot;.\n \nThis is serious rock by a bunch of guys who have no problem NOT taking \nthemselves all that seriously.\n__________\n\n 1.
