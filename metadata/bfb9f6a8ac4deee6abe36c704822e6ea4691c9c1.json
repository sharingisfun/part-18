Bukhovtsev, V. Krivchenkov, G. Myakishev, and V. Shalnov.\n\n    This collection of 816 problems is based on the textbook &quot;Elementary Physics&quot; edited by Academician G. S. Landsberg. For this reason the content and nature of the problems and their arrangement mainly conform with this textbook. There is no section devoted to &quot;Atomic Physics&quot;, however, since the exercises in Landsberg's book illustrate the relevant material in sufficient detail. Some problems on this subject have been included in other chapters.\nThe problems, most of which are unique, require a fundamental knowledge of the basic laws of physics, and the ability to apply them in the most diverse conditions. A number of problems in the book have been revised from those used at the annual contests organized by the Physics faculty of the Moscow University. The solutions of all the difficult problems are given in great\ndetail. Solutions are also given for some of the simpler ones. The book is recommended for self-education of senior pupils of general and special secondary and technical schools. Many problems will be useful for first and second year students of higher schools.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by A. Troitsky and was edited by G. Leib. Mir Publishers published this book first in 1971 and was reprinted again in 1978.
