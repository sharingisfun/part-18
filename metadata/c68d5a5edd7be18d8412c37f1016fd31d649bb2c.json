Though the Boston quintet's glam-rock swagger and lip-smacking arena-rock dramatics paved the way for Guns n' Roses, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e, and countless others, their hip-shake rhythms were steeped in old R&amp;B and blues. The band's affinity for the groove provided a logical bridge for the first rock-rap crossover, Run-D.M.C.'s inner-city reincarnation of Aerosmith's &quot;Walk This Way.&quot;\n\nAerosmith establishes the formula that would carry the so-called Toxic Twins -singer Steven Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry - through three decades in which they'd swing wildly between hits and hokum, shotgun-blues raunch and purple balladry. Perry brought riffs by way of the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds, and Tyler the bawdiness, while second guitarist Brad Whitford, bassist Tom Hamilton, and drummer Joey Kramer applied the lubrication. &quot;Dream On&quot; is the debut's signature piece, a &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“style ballad that suggested these hard-rock bad boys had arena aspirations from the get-go.\n\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\n\n\nSince Aerosmith had become one of America's premier rock &amp; roll concert attractions by 1978, it was only natural that an in-concert collection was issued that year, the double album, Live Bootleg. Unlike other live albums at the time, it's obvious that not a lot of overdubbing was involved to fix up the tracks, which results in a refreshingly authentic representation of Aerosmith at the group's most drugged-out and rocking. All of the performances were taken from Tyler and company's 1977-1978 U.S. tour (with the exception of a couple from 1973), while the album's packaging and title were a joke on all the poor-sounding, unauthorized live recordings that were in circulation at the time. Just about every classic is included -- &quot;Back in the Saddle,&quot; &quot;Sweet Emotion,&quot; &quot;Walk This Way,&quot; &quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;Last Child,&quot; &quot;Mama Kin,&quot; &quot;Train Kept A'Rollin,&quot; etc. -- as well as key album tracks (&quot;Sick as a Dog,&quot; &quot;S.O.S.,&quot; etc.). But the album's high point has to be the aforementioned pair of long-lost tracks from 1973 -- loose and groovy covers of the Yardbirds' &quot;I Ain't Got You&quot; and James Brown's &quot;Mother Popcorn.&quot; Although the performances may lack the fire of the shorter Classics Live II set from 1988, Live Bootleg is an excellent representation of one of rock &amp; roll's elite live acts. Note: to tie in with the careless bootleg theme of the album, the track &quot;Draw the Line&quot; is unlisted. It's featured as a hidden track at the end of &quot;Mother Popcorn.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n01.Back In The Saddle - Indianapolis, IN, 4 July 1977\n02.Sweet Emotion - Columbus, OH, 24 March 1978\n03.Lord Of The Thighs - Chicago, IL, 23 March 1978\n04.Toys In The Attic - Boston, MA, 28 March 1978\n05.Last Child - The Paradise Club, Boston, MA, 9 August 1978\n06.Come Together - The Wherehouse, Waltham, MA, 21 August 1978\n07.Walk This Way - Detroit, MI, 2 April 1978\n08.Sick As A Dog - Indianapolis, IN, 4 July 1977\n09.Dream On - Louisville, KY, 3 July 1977\n10.Chip Away The Stone - The Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, Santa Monica, CA, 8 April 1978\n11.Sight For Sore Eyes - Columbus, OH, 24 March 1978\n12.Mama Kin - Indianapolis, IN, 4 July 1977\n13.S.O.S. - Indianapolis, IN, 4 July 1977\n14.I Ain't Got You - Paul's Mall, Boston, MA, 23 April 1973; WBCN-FM radio simulcast\n15.Mother Popcorn - Paul's Mall, Boston, MA, 23 April 1973; WBCN-FM radio simulcast / Tower Theater, Upper Darby, Philadelphia, PA, March 26, 1978\n16.Train Kept A Rollin'/Strangers In The Night - Detroit, MI, 2 April 1978\n\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c68d5a5edd7be18d8412c37f1016fd31d649bb2c","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Live+Bootleg+%281978%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c68d5a5edd7be18d8412c37f1016fd31d649bb2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,141,90,94,221,123,225,141,132,18,195,127,16,22,253,49,214,73,187,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
