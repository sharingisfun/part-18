Teaming up once again with producer/director Russ Malkin, they journey in a circular route starting and finishing in Cape Town, taking on all corners of this wild and varied African country, experiencing the deeply rooted cultures, the extraordinary people, the remarkable wildlife and the heart stopping adventures along the way. An abseil from the peak of Cape Town s iconic Table Mountain plunges Charley straight in to the start of his adventure. Following this he embarks on a journey of extremes that includes cage diving with deadly Great White Sharks in the rough Atlantic seas; navigating the majestic yet incredibly precarious Sani Pass to reach the icy peak; detonating dynamite deep underground in a Barberton Gold Mine; tracking lions on foot in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park; and searching the ocean floor for the perfect diamond in the ship wreck strewn West Coast. The incredible trip culminates in a huge motorbike convoy down to Signal Hill in Cape Town accompanied by over 250 local riders.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nThe first episode opens in spectacular style, with Charley ready to take on Table Mountain. At 3500ft, this is one of the country's most instantly recognisable landmarks. With the vast Atlantic Ocean as the backdrop, he abseils from the summit then crosses the shark-infested waters to historic Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated for 18 years. At Gansbaai, he braves a 'Jaws' moment, cage-diving while Great White sharks are fed bait, then makes his way up the coast to the Born Free Foundation, where he is introduced to some of the rescued lions and leopards. Finally, he goes back into the water for a hair-raising sardine run with a twist. &quot;I've had the most amazing time traveling through South Africa over the past six weeks,&quot; says Charley. &quot;I fell in love with South Africa the very first time I came here and I feel so lucky to have been able to really explore it further and get to spend lots of time with the fantastic people.&quot;\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThis week, Charley's trip starts just south of Durban where he is trying his hand at a spot of surfing amongst some of the country's largest and fastest waves. Then he faces one of South Africa's most challenging adventures - successfully navigating the Sani Pass. Leading up through the mountains towards Lesotho, Charley and team take a car up the treacherously steep and extremely icy path to the summit. This is a nerve-racking drive, during which one false move could see them plunge over a sheer mountain drop. Continuing their adventure towards the clouds, the team embark on a challenging trek to the top of Tugela Falls, enduring icy cold winds before setting up camp on the summit.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nCharley samples South African life from three differing perspectives - in the air, deep below ground and in the bush. He starts by taking to the skies as he learns how to parajet. Although delivering some of the most spectacular views of South Africa, this is an activity that requires great skill to master, as Charley finds out. He then heads underground in order to get to grips with one of South Africa's oldest working gold mines, and tries his hand blasting for the precious metal himself. Charley rounds off the episode by visiting South Africa's flagship Kruger National Park. Extending over 7,300 square miles, this is the country's largest game reserve. Charley is hoping to encounter rhinos, hippos, elephants, crocodiles and giraffes. On a 'wilderness experience on wheels', he spends three days traversing the Lebombo Eco-Trail, enjoying the sounds and scents of the bush, getting up close to Africa's greatest wild animals and enjoying traditional bushveld dinners around the campfire.\n\n4)  Part 4 \nThis week, Charley meets a research team who study scorpions and risks life and limb learning how to handle one of the world's most venomous creatures. Heading into the centre of the country, Charley gets behind the wheel of some of the giant trucks and machines used in the open iron ore mines. Moving west, the team spends two nights learning the way of the nomad with the San tribe in the desolate Kgalagadi National Park, before reaching the western coast. Venturing into the ocean once more, Charley goes diving in the open waters for diamonds, before ending the episode, and the series, in true Boorman style - leading a convoy of over 300 bikers from the Meer lust Winery through the beautiful mountains and beaches of Cape Town, to Signal Hill, renowned for its spectacular views.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img803.imageshack.us/img803/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img803.imageshack.us/img803/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2440/charleyboormanssouthafr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;db93b2bcb39b97e8f5ea&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2001 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps AC3 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 44mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 644 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/charley-boormans-south-african-adventure/episodes/episode-1-512&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/charley-boormans-south-african-adventure/episodes/episode-1-512&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4bad89d526634678d708255913d183e2bdc3488","amp;dn":"Ch5+Charley+Boormans+South+African+Adventure+1of4+DVDrip+x264+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4bad89d526634678d708255913d183e2bdc3488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,186,216,157,82,102,52,103,141,112,130,85,145,61,24,62,43,220,52,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
