These files are from other torrents and were just reposted by me. This torrent contains all three albums which Pendulum has put out. They're (2005) Hold Your Colour, (2008) In Silico, (2010) Immersion.\n\nI'll be seeding for a couple days until i get more people on board with me so please stay patient.
