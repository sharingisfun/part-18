Cooking with molecular compounds will be far more energy efficient and environmentally sustainable than traditional techniques of cooking. This new way of thinking about food heralds a phase of culinary evolution on which the long-term survival of a growing human population depends. HervÃ© This clearly explains the properties of naturally occurring and synthesized compounds, dispels a host of misconceptions about the place of chemistry in cooking, and shows why note-by-note cooking is an obviousâ€•and inevitableâ€•extension of his earlier pioneering work in molecular gastronomy. An appendix contains a representative selection of recipes, vividly illustrated in color","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ebd5be88aee1d22dca6530b0b05bfd40143ae9a","amp;dn":"Note-by-Note+Cooking+-+The+Future+of+Food+%282014%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ebd5be88aee1d22dca6530b0b05bfd40143ae9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,189,91,232,138,238,29,34,220,166,83,11,11,5,191,212,1,67,174,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
