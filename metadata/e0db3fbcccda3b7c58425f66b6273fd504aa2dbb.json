WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve asked 400 influencers to raise awareness and inspire change by digitizing the previously unreleased song and sharing it online using #EndangeredSong. The 400 lathe-cut polycarbonate records are the only copies in existence and will actually degrade over time as the record is played. The song will go extinct unless itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s digitally reproduced. The Sumatran tiger will go extinct unless we take action. This is the Endangered Song Project.\n\nPortugal. The Man is an American rock band from Wasilla, Alaska. The group consists of John Gourley, Zach Carothers, Kyle O'Quin,\nand Jason Sechrist.\n\nPlease share this torrent on various social media using #EndangeredSong and #SumatranTiger","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0db3fbcccda3b7c58425f66b6273fd504aa2dbb","amp;dn":"Portugal.+The+Man+-+Sumatran+Tiger+-+The+Endangered+Song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0db3fbcccda3b7c58425f66b6273fd504aa2dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,219,63,188,204,218,59,124,88,66,95,102,182,39,63,213,4,170,45,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
