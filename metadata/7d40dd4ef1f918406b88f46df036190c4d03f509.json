He falls into uneasy friendship with a New Mexico farmwoman (Geraldine Page) whose husband deserts her for long stretches, and whose son (Lee Aaker) is blood brother to the local Apache chieftain. A good, spare frontier tale in which danger and solace come in unexpected ways.\n  Based on the Louis L'Amour story &quot;The Gift of Cochise,&quot; this sparkling western has a poetic and exciting script, outstanding performances, and breathtaking scenery.\n\n  Starring: John Wayne, Geraldine Page, Ward Bond, Michael Pate, James Arness.\n\n  Directed by: John Farrow.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 24min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 640 x 480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d40dd4ef1f918406b88f46df036190c4d03f509","amp;dn":"Hondo+%281953%29+%28John+Wayne%2C+Geraldine+Page%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d40dd4ef1f918406b88f46df036190c4d03f509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,64,221,78,241,249,24,64,107,136,244,109,240,54,25,12,77,3,245,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
