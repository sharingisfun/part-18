Through his storied tenure with the Red Sox, he pretty much got his wish. He not only hit, he knew how to hit; there was no keener, more devoted, more articulate student of the art. The Science of Hitting is his comprehensive book of wisdom and anecdote, a baseball bible that offers clear, concise, well-illustrated, fundamental information on how to hit a baseball and, just as important, how to think about hitting a baseball. Williams' first commandment is &quot;Get a good pitch to hit,&quot; and, in one of baseball's most dramatic teaching tools--a photograph that divides his strike zone into 77 baseballs, seven wide by 11 high--Williams projects what he would hit at each pitch location, from .230 on the low-outside strike to .400 in what he called his &quot;happy zone,&quot; the heart of the plate belt high. In 1941, that happy zone was obviously ecstatic; Williams hit .406 that year, the last to break the magic .400 barrier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad2d19ba66818e02436bcdc8ba7c92a65d2ecd9c","amp;dn":"Ted+Williams+-+The+Science+of+Hitting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad2d19ba66818e02436bcdc8ba7c92a65d2ecd9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,45,25,186,102,129,142,2,67,107,205,200,186,124,146,166,93,46,205,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
