The release of Family&amp;#039;s similarly titled debut then prompted them to adopt the minimalist title The Beatles for what is now more commonly referred to as The White Album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4068833c60b75696af95480e5054fb569af6398b","amp;dn":"Family+music+in+a+dolls+house","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4068833c60b75696af95480e5054fb569af6398b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,104,131,60,96,183,86,150,175,149,72,14,80,84,251,86,154,246,57,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
