Why is this so when autonomy, personal freedom and individualism are more highly prized than ever before? Sara Maitland answers this question by exploring changing attitudes throughout history. Offering experiments and strategies for overturning our fear of solitude, she helps us to practise it without anxiety and encourages us to see the benefits of spending time by ourselves. By indulging in the experience of being alone, we can be inspired to find our own rewards and ultimately lead more enriched, fuller lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97816c1c7c2bd606c76a5b86fcaab98ec03bacf4","amp;dn":"How+to+Be+Alone+%28The+School+of+Life%29+%282014%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97816c1c7c2bd606c76a5b86fcaab98ec03bacf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,129,108,28,124,43,214,6,199,106,91,134,252,170,185,142,192,59,172,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
