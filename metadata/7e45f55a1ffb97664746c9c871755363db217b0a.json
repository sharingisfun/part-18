Gnecco, E. Meyer (Springer, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book provides an updated review on the development of scanning probe microscopy and related techniques, and the availability of computational techniques not even imaginable a few decades ago. The 36 chapters cover instrumental aspects, theoretical models and selected experimental results, thus offering a broad panoramic view on fundamental issues in nanotribology which are currently being investigated. Compared to the first edition, several topics have been added, including triboluminescence, graphene mechanics, friction and wear in liquid environments, capillary condensation, and multiscale friction modeling. Particular care has been taken to avoid overlaps and guarantee the independence of the chapters. In this way, our book aims to become a key reference on this subject for the next five to ten years to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e45f55a1ffb97664746c9c871755363db217b0a","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Friction+and+Wear+on+the+Nanoscale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e45f55a1ffb97664746c9c871755363db217b0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,69,245,90,31,251,151,102,71,70,201,200,113,117,83,99,219,33,123,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
