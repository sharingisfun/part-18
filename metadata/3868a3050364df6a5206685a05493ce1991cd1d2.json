For those tired of these contradictions, fed up with hearing about divine mysteries when there aren't any, and offended by being told they're going to hell, atheism is a popular and logical answer. \n\nThis book contains all you need to know about what to pack for your journey on the enlightening road to atheism, including explanations of the five types of atheism and the difference between an atheist and an agnosticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a term invented by T. H. Huxley, famous for his defense of DarwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as how a deist differs from a theist. \n\nLearn why Christians were originally called atheists; read about Lucretius and his fellow materialists; and revel alongside atheists who happily have nothing to defend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3868a3050364df6a5206685a05493ce1991cd1d2","amp;dn":"How+to+Be+a+Good+Atheist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3868a3050364df6a5206685a05493ce1991cd1d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,104,163,5,3,100,223,106,82,6,104,90,5,73,60,225,153,28,209,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
