How do I obtain happiness? How do I fully become a man or woman? Despite a multitude of self-help books in recent years, these eternal questions have become increasingly urgent in today's directionless world.\r\n\r\nAuthor Jacques Philippe provides some answers. In his new book, Called to Life, he explains that a complete and fulfilled life is much more assured when we stop trying to chart our own course, when we realize that we are essentially creatures called by God. He goes on to describe where and how these calls take place: the events of life, the Word of God in Scripture, and interior motions of the Holy Spirit. Learning to recognize and follow these calls is what leads to a happy and full life.\r\n\r\nCalled to Life includes a special section on how to read Sacred Scripture prayerfully (Lectio Divina), making this a timely source of inspiration and guidance following the recommendations of Pope Benedict XVI and the 2008 Synod of Bishops on the Word of God.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c99fbe25bb9ccf3b83b2863e3c4795d9ec8fa0a","amp;dn":"Jacques+Philippe+-+Called+to+Life+%28EPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c99fbe25bb9ccf3b83b2863e3c4795d9ec8fa0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,153,251,226,91,185,204,243,184,59,40,99,227,196,121,93,158,200,250,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
