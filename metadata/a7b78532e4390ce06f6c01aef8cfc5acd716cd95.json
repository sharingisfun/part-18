With strong assistance from bassist Ron Carter and drummer Al Foster, Tyner and Henderson make for a perfect team on four originals by group members (including the tenor's classic &quot;Recorda Me&quot;) and four superior standards. The advanced hard bop music is as rewarding as one would expect.\nAn instantly classic jazz album, and not so incidentally, the best jazz audiophile album ever made.\n\n&quot;This is one profoundly natural-sounding presentation of an acoustic jazz quartet. New York Reunion is the finest album in years by both Tyner and Henderson, and it's Chesky's most important work to date.&quot;\n\nRecorded using a specially modified microphone with all tube MANLEY REFERENCE electronics by David Manley from Vacuum Tube Logic of America.\n \nProduced by David Chesky.\nRecorded by Bob Katz.\nRecorded at RCA Studio A, New York City on April 3 &amp; 4, 1991.\n\nFor the liner notes, change the pdfX extension into pdf.\n\nHDtracks PCM-24Bit-96Khz-FLAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7b78532e4390ce06f6c01aef8cfc5acd716cd95","amp;dn":"McCoy+Tyner+-+New+York+Reunion+%281991%29+HDtracks+24-96-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7b78532e4390ce06f6c01aef8cfc5acd716cd95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,183,133,50,228,57,12,224,111,108,1,174,248,207,197,172,215,22,205,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
