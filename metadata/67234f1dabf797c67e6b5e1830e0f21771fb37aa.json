Based on the Broadway musical by Lynn Root, John LaTouche, and Vernon Duke, the film tells the story of Joe (Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson), a shantytown denizen torn between the affections of faithful wife Petunia (Ethel Waters) and slinky seductress Georgia (Lena Horne). Seriously injured in a barroom brawl, Joe dreams that he is the centerpiece of a celestial power struggle between a heavenly emissary (Kenneth Spencer) and Lucifer Jr. (Rex Ingram, who ironically had played &quot;De Lawd&quot; in The Green Pastures). Joe is given another chance to redeem himself on Earth, lest he fall into the clutches of the Devil's little boy. Louis Armstrong briefly shows up, appropriately cast as &quot;The Trumpeter.&quot; Song highlights include &quot;Taking a Chance on Love,&quot; &quot;Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe,&quot; &quot;Life's Full of Consequences,&quot; and the title song. A troubled production thanks to the on-set rivalry between Ethel Waters and Lena Horne, Cabin in the Sky is nonetheless an excellent first feature effort from Vincente Minnelli. Thanks to his careful treatment of the material, the expected patronization of the black characters does not impede latter-day enjoyment of the film as much as it might have. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035703/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035703/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_in_the_Sky&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_in_the_Sky&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-15624&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-15624&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector:\nVincente Minnelli\n\n\n\n        Ethel Waters\t ... \tPetunia Jackson\n\tEddie 'Rochester' Anderson\t... \tJoseph 'Little Joe' Jackson\n\n\tLena Horne\t... \tGeorgia Brown\n\n\tLouis Armstrong\t... \tThe Trumpeter\n\tRex Ingram\t... \tLucifer Jr. / Lucius Ferry\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:38:37\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480 4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 30,00\nBitRate : 1141 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67234f1dabf797c67e6b5e1830e0f21771fb37aa","amp;dn":"Cabin+in+the+Sky+%281943%29+Ethel+Waters+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67234f1dabf797c67e6b5e1830e0f21771fb37aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,35,79,29,171,247,151,198,126,107,94,24,48,224,242,23,113,251,55,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
