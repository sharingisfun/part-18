It was available throughout Europe but remained unreleased on compact disc in the U.S. until September 1998. Until then it was only available as an import.\n\nThe song &quot;Together in Electric Dreams&quot; by Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder was released as a single and became an international hit in 1984. It was later featured in their album Philip Oakey &amp; Giorgio Moroder (1985). It is still regularly played live by Oakey's band The Human League to this day and remains one of their most popular live songs. Another song, &quot;Video!&quot; by Jeff Lynne, was also released as a single (with a non-album track, &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, as the B-side) but it wasn't as successful.\n\nThe song &quot;Love Is Love&quot; by Culture Club was released as a single in 1985 in Canada, Europe and Japan. The single went top 3 in Canada, top 10 in Japan and was Culture Club's biggest hit in Brazil.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dreams_%28soundtrack%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dreams_%28soundtrack%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nRip Info:\n\nVinyl condition: VG\n\nPlayback device: echnics SL-1200MK5\n\nPreamplifier: PS audio GCPH ModII\n\nADC: LynxTwo\n\nProgram-digitizer: SF10\n\nYear: 1984\n\nLabel: Virgin Records America, Inc.\n\nCountry of Origin: US\n\nAudio Codec: FLAC\n\nRip: image +.
