Documentary filmmakers Samir Abdallah and Jose Reynes alternate scenes from the writers' journey with testimonials from the Palestinian people, readings by Darwish and reflections from the concerned authors as they bear witness to what they see.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be2aa62520bbd62b2548e7491199f97f16fb94b","amp;dn":"Writers+On+The+Borders-+INFOFALLOUT+Documentary+Israel%2FPalestine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be2aa62520bbd62b2548e7491199f97f16fb94b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,226,170,98,82,11,189,98,178,84,142,116,145,25,159,151,241,111,185,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
