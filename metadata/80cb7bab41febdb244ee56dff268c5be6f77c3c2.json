However, it's not long before her instincts tell her there's more than a basic story to be found in the popular, northwestern Wyoming mountain area. A chance encounter with attractive cowboy Jake Norris soon has Paige chasing a legend of buried treasure, passed down through generations.\n\nFrom the torn edge of a water-damaged map to the mysterious glow of an antler arch, Paige will follow clues high into the mountainous terrain and deep into Jackson's history. Side-stepping a few shady characters who are also searching for the same hidden reward, she will have to decide who is trustworthy and who is not.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80cb7bab41febdb244ee56dff268c5be6f77c3c2","amp;dn":"Above+the+Bridge+%28Paige+Mackenzie+Mystery+%231%29+-+Deborah+Garner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80cb7bab41febdb244ee56dff268c5be6f77c3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,203,123,171,65,254,189,178,68,238,86,223,242,104,197,190,111,119,195,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
