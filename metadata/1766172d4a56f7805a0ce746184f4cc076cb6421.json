It has quickly risen to become one of my favorite metal tracks. The rest of the album is pretty consistently awesome. This is my first Metal Church album, so apparently there's a different vocalist than in the past. I found the vocalist to fit just fine with the music, perhaps if I had their other stuff I would have a different opinion. \n\nThe one *big* downer for me on this is the production. I know they were going for a &quot;retro&quot; sound here but I didn't dump $10k on a sound system to hear muddy tones. It really agitates me at first but I get used to it after ONLY listening to this album a bit. If you're picky about sound you might not like this album's production. But don't let that get in the way entirely, or you'll miss out on a great metal album!\n\nby Drewboy\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - A Light In The Dark.wma                                          \n02 - Beyond All Reason.wma                                            \n03 - Mirror Of Lies.wma                                               \n04 - Disappear.wma                                                    \n05 - The Believer.wma                                                 \n06 - Temples Of The Sea.wma                                           \n07 - Pill For The Kill.wma                                            \n08 - Son Of The Son.wma                                               \n09 - More Than Your Master.wma                                        \n10 - Blinded By Life.wma                                              \n11 - Watch The Children Pray 2006 (Bonustrack For David Wayne).wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n\nFollow Me On Facebook Pages: MarcelodrgzTPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1766172d4a56f7805a0ce746184f4cc076cb6421","amp;dn":"Metal+Church+-+A+Light+In+The+Dark+%282006%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1766172d4a56f7805a0ce746184f4cc076cb6421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,102,23,45,74,86,247,128,90,12,231,70,24,79,76,192,118,203,100,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
