The album went \nto No. 13 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart,and had two charting singles: \n&quot;Easy Street&quot; (#83 Pop Singles) and River's Risin' (33 Pop Singles)\n\nWith this release, Edgar Winter was faced with the question that haunts many a superstar following a highly successful album -- how can he outdo himself? While Shock Treatment falls short of outdoing \n\nhimself, it still manages to rock pretty righteously. Beginning with this album's answer to their previous &quot;Hangin' Around,&quot; &quot;Some Kinda Animal,&quot; the band moves into the excellent blues torcher &quot;Easy \n\nStreet,&quot; which is painted with highlights from the substantial saxophone talent of Winter, not to mention some of his finest singing. Like They Only Come Out at Night, this recording includes a pair of \n\nhaunting ballads, &quot;Maybe Someday You'll Call My Name&quot; and &quot;Someone Take My Heart Away.&quot; &quot;Queen of My Dreams,&quot; along with &quot;River's Risin',&quot; showcase the Edgar Winter Group doing what they do best -- rocking \n\nout with passion and lots of drums and guitar. Not as good as their previous album, but still a winner in its own right. \n\nRick Derringer  -  Bass, Guitar, Guitar (Rhythm), Vocals, Vocals (bckgr), Producer, Slide Guitar, Sitar (Electric), Electric Sitar \nDan Hartman  -  Guitar (Acoustic), Bass, Guitar, Percussion, Autoharp, Castanets, Guitar (Rhythm), Vocals, Vocals (bckgr) \nSteven Paul  -  Organic Director \nEdgar Winter  -  Organ, Synthesizer, Bass, Piano, Keyboards, Saxophone, Vocals, Vocals (bckgr), Clavinet, Mellotron, Vibraphone, Performer, Arp Bass \nJimmy Iovine  -  Assistant Engineer \nChuck Ruff  -  Drums, Vocals, Oscillator \nLou Schlossberg  -  Assistant Engineer \nShelly Yakus  -  Engineer, Technical Director \nLehman Yates  -  Assistant Engineer \nBill King  -  Photography \nVic Anesini  -  Mastering \nTeresa Alfieri  -  Design \n\n\n Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Some Kinda Animal&quot; (Dan Hartman) \n   2. &quot;Easy Street&quot; (Hartman) \n   3. &quot;Sundown&quot; (Hartman) \n   4. &quot;Miracle Of Love&quot; (Edgar Winter, Hartman) \n   5. &quot;Do Like Me&quot; (Winter) \n   6. &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot; (Hartman) \n   7. &quot;Someone Take My Heart Away&quot; (Winter) \n   8. &quot;Queen Of My Dreams&quot; (Hartman) \n   9. &quot;Maybe Some Day You'll Call My Name&quot; (Hartman)\n  10. &quot;River's Risin'&quot; (Hartman) \n  11. &quot;Animal&quot; (Winter) \n\nEnjoy &amp; please don\\'t forget to SEED!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:596b52e1934b73df43f67a535414f39a45ec3992","amp;dn":"The+Edgar+Winter+Group-Shock+Treatment+%281974%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"596b52e1934b73df43f67a535414f39a45ec3992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,107,82,225,147,75,115,223,67,246,122,83,84,20,243,154,69,236,57,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
