Divided up between a vocal and instrumental (mostly) half, each disc is more or less chronological and succeeds on its own, and together they're nearly unstoppable. \r\nCurious to say, but compared to, say, a fair amount of the Brit-pop hype that burst the year the compilation finishes up, Renegade Soundwave were at once very specifically English -- Gary Asquith's declamatory speak-sing-MC work never hid its accent for a start -- and very modern as well. Hip-hop and dub were turned into massive industrial beats and stomps like few others could attempt (&quot;Kray Twins&quot; alone easily rivals and possibly betters a fair amount of mid-'80s Def Jam explosions), avoiding the forced modernism of the likes of the Age of Chance for something more cutting and fierce. \r\nBesides the basic hits per se -- &quot;Kray Twins,&quot; &quot;Biting My Nails,&quot; &quot;Women Respond to Bass,&quot; &quot;Thunder,&quot; &quot;Probably a Robbery&quot; -- there are B-sides and rare and new remixes for the hardcore fan who has all four albums (counting The Next Chapter of Dub). Two separate mixes of &quot;Cocaine Sex&quot; turn up (the &quot;Turbo Lust Mix&quot; is indeed quite lewd), along with a fantastic revamp of &quot;Biting My Nails&quot; from 1990 and one of Leftfield's best-ever efforts: a loping, snarling crawl through &quot;Renegade Soundwave.&quot; The further inclusion of such unfairly less well-known tracks as &quot;The Phantom,&quot; an absolute stormer that seems to have barely aged any, and the John Williams-sampling &quot;Deadly&quot; is even more of a reason to listen.
