In the second movie, &quot;The Migration&quot;, we non-surprisingly see the migration of that part of the Bulgars led by Asparuh in search of a new home. Historical note: Asparuh's four other brothers dispersed into different directions - the oldest, Bat-Bayan, stayed in his father's lands and was conquered by the tribe of the Khazars; the second, Kotrag, led his people north towards the middle Volga and Kama rivers, where they eventually established the so-called Volga Bulgarian state, destroyed by the Mongols in the 13th century; the fourth and fifth, Kuber and Altsek, first moved into modern-day Hungary, but then split ways again, with the former settling in modern Macedonia and the latter - in Langobard Italy.\r\n\r\nOriginal title: Ð¥Ð°Ð½ ÐÑÐ¿Ð°Ñ€ÑƒÑ… - ÐŸÑ€ÐµÑÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð¸ÐµÑ‚Ð¾\r\nGenre: Historical\r\nCountry: Bulgaria\r\nDuration: 01:48:46\r\nYear: 1981\r\nLanguage: Bulgarian\r\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:279059e61080bc5d8e42fd830e7568582731d5ef","amp;dn":"Han+Asparuh+part+II+%281981%29+256p+DVDRip-Zamunda+%5BEN+sub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"279059e61080bc5d8e42fd830e7568582731d5ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,144,89,230,16,128,188,93,142,66,253,131,14,117,104,88,39,49,213,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
