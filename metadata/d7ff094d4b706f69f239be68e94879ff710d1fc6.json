It is a spiritual discipline designed to help you know God better, trust him more fully, and love him more deeply. Scores of books have been written that offer guidance for building the marriage of your dreams. But what if God's primary intent for your marriage isn't to make you happy . . . but holy? And what if your relationship isn't as much about you and your spouse as it is about you and God? Everything about your marriage--everything--is filled with prophetic potential, with the capacity for discovering and revealing Christ's character","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7ff094d4b706f69f239be68e94879ff710d1fc6","amp;dn":"Sacred+Marriage%3A+What+If+God+Designed+Marriage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7ff094d4b706f69f239be68e94879ff710d1fc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,255,9,77,75,112,111,105,242,57,190,104,233,72,121,255,113,13,31,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
