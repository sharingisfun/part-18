Henry Harding MP is played by Tom Bell and Christien Anholt plays Peter Emery. In addition, several well-known BDSM performance artists appear:\n\nChaos Clowns \nLuci The Axle Grinder, also known as Lucifire \nMiss Kimberly \nThe Fetisnonn Suzi Woodroffe \nTutu \n\nThe film was originally developed by the BBC, but they later dropped the script, believing it would never be capable of showing the movie on UK TV. However, in April 2004 the movie was shown on terrestrial TV in the UK on BBC1.\n\nThe film was banned in Ireland by then film censor Sheamus Smith.\n\n  Guinevere Turner  ...

Harding is set on putting a club called &quot;House of Thwax&quot; run by Mistress Tanya Cheex out of business, and is sure that Peter's secretly videotaped evidence of the club's activities will do the trick. However, the virginal Peter takes a liking to Tanya Cheex and finds himself falling for the Mistress\n\nPerhaps still serving as a cinematic lighthouse for the BSDM movement over a decade after its release, 1997ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreaching to the PervertedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has resurfaced on DVD for reasons that arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t immediately clear to this reviewer. A well-shot ode the spanked-bottom-needs of the average conservative citizen, the picture is a clumsy pass at both comedic overkill and discomforting sensuality. Still, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a hard film to outright dismiss.\nWhen EnglandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s United Front Opposing Filth morality squad gets ready to make a final stand against pornography, they enlist virginal Peter (Christien Anholt) to join the cause. An upright employee for a Christian-based ISP, Peter is eager to head undercover and trap the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s number one enemy: dominatrix Tanya Cheex (Guinevere Turner). As Peter slips into the violent BSDM underworld, he becomes smitten with the aloof Tanya, attempting to woo her with his inexperience. As Peter gathers his evidence through spy sunglasses and witness accounts, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drawn closer to his mistress, finding her power bewitching, while completely frustrated with her punishing sexual demands. For Tanya, Peter represents the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvanillaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ relationship she naturally avoids, unearthing sympathies that threaten her livelihood and growing slave kingdom.\n\nWritten and directed by Stuart Urban, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreachingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is intended as an odyssey into the spirit of sexual perversion and the responses taboo inclinations provoke out of all sides of the argument. The structure is straight out of a goofball detective film, with a heavy slant toward comedy to help temper the edgy sights and sounds of a subculture few take the time to understand. Using Peter as our guide, the film observes the command and showmanship of TanyaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s controversial club shows: Vegas-style revues that combine fantastically ornate fetish costuming and excruciating stunts, where Tanya greets her fans with a few versatile moments of blunt trauma. \n\nThe BSDM sequences come off as moderately accurate; the screenplay is cautious to explain the subtlety between pain and pleasure, while also keeping a watchful eye on issues of consent (penetration is a huge no-no). Sure, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreachingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ assembles some rather operatic displays of the lifestyle, complete with laser shows and throbbing dance music (perhaps this film inspired the Wachowski Brothers?), but respect is paid to the scene, and its multi-colored, multi-holed inhabitants. A lesser film would paint everyone with a pierced nipple and a desire for genital torture as a freak worthy of a methodical narrative dehumanization. This movie accepts them as family. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost quaint. \n\nTrying to achieve both comic and dramatic tones, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreachingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gets lost quickly. The serious side of the film is derailed by the acting, a performance effort that minimizes the spectacle of the visuals. Cutting a striking figure, the fetching Turner makes for an imposing latex-clad, cherry-lipped overlord of the night, but sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unable to feel around the confessional sequences of the film to satisfaction. Turner is best without dialogue. Once the film gives itself over to comedy, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Benny Hill meets a Nine Inch Nails video, and none of it seems to work. Overall, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreachingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ takes on too much, forgetting its goals as the running time wears on and the cast becomes increasingly forgetful of true motivation.\n\nEventually, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreachingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ transforms into a courtroom drama, positioning itself as an attack on hypocritical figures of government, who push agendas of censorship while enjoying the fruits of provocative entertainment at home. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a half-hearted push to lend the film some social weight; a stab toward legitimacy to ease the lasting sting of shock value Urban likes to toy with. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreaching to the PervertedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a striking look at a retro BSDM playground, but if the storytelling had more consistency, perhaps the titillation wouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had a far more enlightening aftertaste.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bc404935fb3a53c2bbb1b29926c005acf2ce0fb","amp;dn":"Preaching+to+the+Perveted+%5B1997%5D+Stuart+Urban","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bc404935fb3a53c2bbb1b29926c005acf2ce0fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,196,4,147,95,179,165,60,43,187,27,41,146,108,0,90,207,44,224,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
