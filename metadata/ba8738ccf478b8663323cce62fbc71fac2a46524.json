He was a vagrant hippie who wandered to Toronto, where he ended up playing with Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, and he became a household name in the 1980s with his hit song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Super Freak.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Later in life, he was a bad boy who got caught up in drug smuggling and ended up in prison. But since his passing in August 2004, Rick James has remained a legendary icon whose name is nearly synonymous with funk musicÃ¢â‚¬â€and who popularized the genre, creating a lasting influence on pop artists from Prince to Jay-Z to Snoop Dogg, among countless others.\n\nIn Glow, Rick James and acclaimed music biographer David Ritz collaborated to write a no-holds-barred memoir about the boy and the man who became a music superstar in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disco age. It tells of JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upbringing and how his mother introduced him to musical geniuses of the time. And it reveals details on many universally revered artists, from Marvin Gaye and Prince to Nash, Teena Marie, and Berry Gordy. James himself said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“My journey has taken me through hell and back. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all in my musicÃ¢â‚¬â€the parties, the pain, the oversized ego, the insane obsessions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But despite his bad boy behavior, James was a tremendous talent and a unique, unforgettable human being. His Ã¢â‚¬Å“glowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was an overriding quality that one of his mentors saw in himÃ¢â‚¬â€and one that will stay with this legendary figure who left an indelible mark on American popular music.\n\n\nBy David Ritz, Rick James\nPublished by Atria Books in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 352 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8738ccf478b8663323cce62fbc71fac2a46524","amp;dn":"Glow%3AThe+Autobiography+of+Rick+James%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8738ccf478b8663323cce62fbc71fac2a46524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,135,56,204,244,120,184,102,51,35,204,230,47,188,113,250,194,164,101,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
