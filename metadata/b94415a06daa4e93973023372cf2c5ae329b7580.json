Install this .iso to your PS2 HDD directly, and when you run the game from HDloader or HDAdvance, the Action Replay Max will boot first, allowing you to select the codes for the game (select expert mode), and then boot directly into the game. You can also chose not to use the codes and just boot into the game from the AR menu. I made this image using the guide made by Andrew691 on the Afterdawn forums (http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/289279), so credit goes to him. I will be uploading other images for other games with AR added in as well. For now, enjoy!\n\n\n-Tested with HDLoader .8b. Should work with HDAdvance as well, not sure about USBAdvance. If burned to DVD, i&amp;#039;m not sure how this would load using a modchip or swapmagic, if anyone tries, please lemme know.\n\nNOTE: Be sure when installing to HDD to install under the ARMax Disc ID (SLUS_200.90)!!!!! If you use the games disc ID, this will not work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b94415a06daa4e93973023372cf2c5ae329b7580","amp;dn":"Dragon+Quest+VIII%3A+Journey+of+the+Cursed+King+with+Action+Replay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b94415a06daa4e93973023372cf2c5ae329b7580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,68,21,160,109,170,78,147,151,48,35,55,44,242,197,174,50,155,117,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
