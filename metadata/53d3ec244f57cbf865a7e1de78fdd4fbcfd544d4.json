Their new project (Vol.2) is a work born from the union of producer/composer Roby Colella (founder of Funky Juice Records) and co-producer/composer and guitarist Steve Micarelli. \n\nA mixture of smooth modern grooves and some of the retro Latin touches coming out of the Italian scene -- almost a fusion of the Schema and Irma styles, served by the Barrio Jazz Gang with help from a variety of solo instrumentalists like veteran trumpet jazzer Eddie Henderson. The main grooves are laid out with a keyboard, percussion, and bassline format -- but they're filled with plenty of jazzy touches that push the album past the usual dancefloor sound\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
