As a three-volume curriculum consisting of a Text, Workbook for Students, and Manual for Teachers, it teaches that the way to universal love and peaceÃ¢â‚¬â€or remembering GodÃ¢â‚¬â€is by undoing guilt through forgiving others. The Course thus focuses on the healing of relationships and making them holy. A Course in Miracles also emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum, of which there are &quot;many thousands&quot;. Consequently, even though the language of the Course is that of traditional Christianity, it expresses a non-sectarian, non-denominational spirituality. A Course in Miracles therefore is a universal spiritual teaching, not a religion.\nThe &quot;Text&quot; presents the theory of the Course and has built into its study the development of the experience of forgiveness that is the Course's goal for the student. In this regard, A Course in Miracles states that &quot;its goal for you is happiness and peace&quot; (Text, p. 241) (T-13.II.7:1) The Text also explains the basis for fear and guilt, and how they can be overcome through miracles, which are defined as maximal &quot;expressions of love&quot;. Miracles are also defined as the shift in perception from fear to love.\n\nThe &quot;Workbook for Students&quot; consists of 365 lessons, an exercise for each day of the year. This one-year training program begins the process of changing the student's mind and perception, though it is not intended to bring one's learning to completion. As stated in the Preface to the Course, &quot;At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit.&quot;\n\nwww.acim.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d4597efdb0a09471a126ba92744d7c3c1eb037","amp;dn":"A+Course+in+Miracles+-+audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d4597efdb0a09471a126ba92744d7c3c1eb037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,212,89,126,253,176,160,148,113,161,38,186,146,116,77,124,60,30,176,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
