(AMG)\n\n\n\n\nThe most consistently enticing disc in the Rock Instrumental Classics series, this is both a great party and driving record and a window on the rhythms that powered soul music in the '60s (and early '70s, in two cases).\nIn addition to some obvious choices (the four Booker T. &amp; the MG's tracks, the Mar-Keys' 'Last Night' ), it also offers some left-field picks, such as the varied approaches to Latin music offered by Ray Barretto, Mongo Santamaria, and El Chicano.\nThe stock of virtuoso performances here is all but endless: the bass-and-drums breakdown on Cliff Nobles and Co.'s 'The Horse,' the glinting guitar solo on the Bar-Kays' 'Soul Finger,' Hugh Masekela's questing trumpet on 'Grazing in the Grass.'
