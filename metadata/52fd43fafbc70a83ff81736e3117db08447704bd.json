It started with The Last Film, a mutant-funk revolving around a marching beat, anthemic brass and angelic vocals. The influence of Yello is clearly visible in the hi-tech electronic beats and vocoders of Frightened In France, though it's no match for Yello's wackiness. In a way, their best could be the moody post-punk of &quot;Watching Their Eyes&quot;, helped by shy philosophical introspection (&quot;we must be strong 'cause only the strong survive&quot;).\n\nThe hyperactive electro music-hall Love Lasts Forever added further spontaneity and cynicism, though the masterpiece was probably All For You, a twisted tribute of 60's pop based around ghostly electronic loops, resigned male vocals, angelic female vocals and elegant washes of piano, accordion and saxophone. Another highlight, the electro-jazz Big Man Restless seems like an obvious influence on Tuxedomoon's later work. Finally, the vibrant party vibes of Desert Song (counteracted by wild electronic effects) predate the likes of Frankie Goes to Hollywood et al.\n\nAn album that needs to be reevaluated. \n\nA1 The Last Film   2:53 \nA2 Frightened in France   3:12 \nA3 Watching Their Eyes   3:10 \nA4 Love Lasts Forever   5:24 \nA5 All For You   3:48 \nA6 The Last Film (Hymn Version)   3:10 \nB1 Big Man Restless   3:13 \nB2 Desert Song   3:21 \nB3 Broken Body   2:41 \nB4 Maybe This Day   3:32 \nB5 In Awe of Industry   3:13 \nB6 Mr Blunt   2:51 \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52fd43fafbc70a83ff81736e3117db08447704bd","amp;dn":"Kissing+The+Pink+-+Naked+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52fd43fafbc70a83ff81736e3117db08447704bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,253,67,250,251,199,10,131,255,129,115,110,49,23,219,8,68,119,4,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
