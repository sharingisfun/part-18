The first man, Pete Wolinsky, found murdered in a local park, is a shady PI for whom Kinsey has little respect; the second, R. T. Dace, is an alcoholic vagrant who not only turns out to be KinseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relative but also leaves her a half-million bucks. Armed with news of R. T.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s death, Kinsey sets out to learn more about him and why he disinherited his immediate family. The clever twists of V Is for Vengeance are mostly absent here, and readers will need to wade through a lot of story before WolinskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s connection to Dace comes clear. But Grafton hasn't lost her touch for characterization. Nobody in the cast is a stereotype, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the clash of personalities and interpersonal dynamics that provide the appeal here. Nearing the conclusion of this celebrated series, Grafton continues to shape MillhoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character, toughened by circumstance but still both understanding and forgiving. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Kinsey Millhone, the well-nigh immortal sleuth in this enduring series, still has time to play her rebel role simply by living a spartan existence in a world of greedy narcissistsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦How sweet it is to see the California private eye back in her garage apartmentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also fun to watch her at work, taking notes on index cards, typing reports on a Smith-Corona and hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what really mattersÃ¢â‚¬â€communicating with people face-to-face.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œNew York Times Book Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ffec71113a0a6a3b613aea698800d8143f5e82e","amp;dn":"Sue+Grafton+-+W+is+for+Wasted","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ffec71113a0a6a3b613aea698800d8143f5e82e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,254,199,17,19,160,166,163,182,19,174,166,152,128,13,129,67,245,232,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
