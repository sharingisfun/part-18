Saint Thomas Aquinas [Thomas of Aquin, or Aquino] (c. 1225 - 7 March 1274) was a philosopher and theologian in the scholastic tradition, known as Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Universalis. He is the foremost classical proponent of natural theology, and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy, which was long the primary philosophical approach of the Roman Catholic Church. The work for which he is best-known is the Summa Theologiae. One of the thirty-three Doctors of the Church, he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church's greatest theologian. Consequently, many institutions of learning have been named after him.\n\n32kbps/44.1khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a76dffe1eb02ecf10e95fc9b39c773ef4f99a4d","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Thomas+Aquinas+-+The+Angelic+Doctor+%28Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a76dffe1eb02ecf10e95fc9b39c773ef4f99a4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,118,223,254,30,176,46,207,16,233,95,201,179,156,119,62,244,249,154,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
