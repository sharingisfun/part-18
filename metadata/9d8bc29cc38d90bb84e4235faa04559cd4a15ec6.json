The Great War transformed women into purveyors and recipients of a new feminine ideal that emphasized their status as national citizens. Although Italian women did not gain the vote, they did encounter a less empowering form of female citizenship just after the war ended with Mussolini's Fascism. Because of the Great War, many women seized the opportunity to participate in a society that continued to recognize them as guardians of the nation.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This excellent study offers extremely valuable insights on gender role changes in Italy between the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century up to the Fascist era. Building upon a strong theoretical framework, the study enriches the field through its inclusion of unpublished womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diaries and papers from Italian and international archives, and published diaries, journals, literary texts, and short biographies of women writers, offering new perspectives on gender role changes during war that apply to women throughout Europe. Recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€CHOICE\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nAllison Scardino Belzer is an Assistant Professor of History at Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah, Georgia.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d8bc29cc38d90bb84e4235faa04559cd4a15ec6","amp;dn":"Allison+Scardino+Belzer+-+Women+and+the+Great+War+%5B2010%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d8bc29cc38d90bb84e4235faa04559cd4a15ec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,139,194,156,195,141,144,187,132,228,35,95,170,4,85,156,212,161,94,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
