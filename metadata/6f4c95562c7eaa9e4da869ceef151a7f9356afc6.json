By now, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure it will come as no surprise to Fire Note readers that I am a pretty die-hard fan of NewellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, in fact, I consider him to be one of my great discoveries of the past few years. Hot on the heels of Captured TracksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recently released 3rd volume of reissues of old Cleaners albums, comes Return To Bohemia, an album that slides right in with their finest work. One could make a convincing argument that this is the best Cleaners From Venus album, and I would certainly entertain the thought. It is undoubtedly in the top three, alongside Living with Victoria Grey and My Back Wages, and rivals even the great aforementioned 1993 solo album produced by Andy Partridge.\n\nI have said it before and I am going to say it again, if you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t checked this band out, you have to PRONTO. Newell is like a cross between Hitchcock, Partridge, Lennon, McCartney, Pollard, and Davies. Absolute songwriting titans, and Newell ranks right up there, he can pull a memorable melody seemingly out of thin air that will have you humming along by the second time you have heard the song. Songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The King of the SixtiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ really could have been recorded at any time between the late 70s and now. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Imaginary SeasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of the quieter, more poignant tracks on the album. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a piano ballad, timeless, gorgeous, simplistic and utterly perfect. Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Going Out With MarilynÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ finds Newell writing about an old familiar character from past Cleaners albums, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good to see that olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Marilyn is still kicking about the scene. \n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nIt is remarkable that Return To Bohemia even exists at all. I would suppose we have to give a tremendous amount of thanks to the folks at Captured Tracks for bringing The Cleaners back into the consciousness of music fans. No longer are they a band that is more heard about than actually heard. Their past is easily accessible where it was in vast disarray just a few short years ago, and now we have Soft Bodies Records to thank for releasing this incredible album from them. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if this will be the final Cleaners From Venus album, I know Newell had a recent health scare, but if it is, he certainly is going out on an incredible high note. If it is not his final album (letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope!) well then this record signifies a rebirth of epic proportions, and I am excited to see where it goes next! This one is highly recommended, go get it.\n\nKey Tracks: Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Going Out With MarilynÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ / Ã¢â‚¬Å“Imaginary SeasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ / Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Wanna Stay InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nArtists With Similar Fire: XTC / Robyn Hitchcock / The Kinks \n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1 Cling to Me 3:11\n2 He's Goin' Out With Marilyn 3:09\n3 The Days of May 3:38\n4 The Royal Bank of Love 2:41\n5 Mrs Gale and Her New Lover 2:41\n6 A European Girl 3:08\n7 Welcome to Bohemia 3:06\n8 Time We Talked Again 2:59\n9 The King of the Sixties 3:57\n10 Imaginary Seas 2:57\n11 The Band Plays Delilah 2:59\n12 I Wanna Stay In 3:10\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: England\nGenre: Indie Pop\nFormat: Tracks\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~650-869 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f4c95562c7eaa9e4da869ceef151a7f9356afc6","amp;dn":"%282014%29+The+Cleaners+from+Venus+-++Bohemia+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f4c95562c7eaa9e4da869ceef151a7f9356afc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,76,149,86,44,126,170,158,77,168,105,206,239,21,26,127,147,86,175,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
