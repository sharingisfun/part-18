The Wisconsin trio's willfully primitive folk-punk emerged fully formed on the group's 1983 eponymous debut, unleashing such classic acoustic barnstormers such as Add It Up,the dance-floor sing-along favourite &quot;Blister in the Sun&quot;,and the murder-suicide song country death song.These tracks are all present here, a band retrospective that follows the Femmes through the good times and beyond, touching down on the Talking Heads-like rendition of T.Rex's &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; (which features the Heads' Jerry Harrison) and the oddly uplifting, nostalgic &quot;American Music&quot;.\nThroughout the compilation, frontman Gordon Gano's unmistakably whiny vocals, caustic lyrics, and fierce acoustic-guitar strumming are at the fore, embodying the skewed charm of this utterly unique ensemble.If your not familliar with this band i suggest you check them out.\n\n01 intro\n02 american music\n03 add it up\n04 country death song\n05 jesus walking on water\n06 black girls\n07 nightmares\n08 gimmie the car\n09 dance motherfucker dance\n10 children of the revolution\n11 blister in the sun\n12 freak magnet\n13 old mother reagan\n14 36-24-36\n15 I danced\n16 america is\n17 i hate tv\n18 out the window\n19 color me once\n20 breakin up\n21 country death song {live}\n22 good feeling {live}\n23 i held her in my arms\n24 gone daddy gone\n25 Add It Up [live]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e839734b2e9a12c1d18b1e3844c0c78b9e1b22f","amp;dn":"Violent+Femmes+-+A+Compilation+%C3%82%C2%AE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e839734b2e9a12c1d18b1e3844c0c78b9e1b22f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,131,151,52,178,233,161,44,29,24,177,227,132,76,12,120,185,225,178,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
