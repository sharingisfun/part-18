The genre is Action RPG. The story begins on a bus to another planet where there are four characters, which must select who will play (I chose Brick). Then you put a stop where a small robot (cute, funky and even irritating) you enter in the game (an interesting feature of the game is that you can still scroll with up to 3 friends, and together perform all missions). You say, &quot;So far nothing new&quot; and you're right. Interestingly in this game is graphics. Engine-off is seen Unreal 3, but as a comic book (which to me seemed a bit ... not a place to imaki genre of game, but some of you might like them).\n\nBorderlands-Game Off The Year\n\nWorking perfektly on Snow Leopard 10.6 or better\n\nWorking perfektly on Lion 10.7 or better\n\nWorking perfektly on 10.8 Puma /and here finish working OS X\n\nTested on ATI 4870 without problem on every OS X\n\nNo tested on to Leopard 1.5 or better,maybe work!\n\nWrapper-Cider Port\n\nAND REMEMBER TO SEED AFTER DOWNLOAD/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d2e8238452579d88bb737a5ae71fd0ce99075b7","amp;dn":"Borderlands+G.O.T.Y+Edition+for+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d2e8238452579d88bb737a5ae71fd0ce99075b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,46,130,56,69,37,121,216,139,183,55,165,174,113,253,12,233,144,117,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
