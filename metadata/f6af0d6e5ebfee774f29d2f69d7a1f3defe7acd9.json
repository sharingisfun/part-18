It was during this period that they were filmed over two nights in Montreal. Originally titled We Will Rock You, Queen Rock Montreal &amp; Live Aid is 96 minutes of Queen at their live best.\n\nFilmed as one-off performances, this was the last time the band played with just its four original members on stage before Hot Space introduced keyboards and extra musicians into their live mix. It is also the first time they played their classic hit, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnder Pressure,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ live. Touring off Greatest Hits, Queen played a set featuring songs from their entire career including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKeep Yourself Alive,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTie Your Mother Down,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnother One Bites the Dust.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe original idea for the show, which was shot on 35mm film, was to take it on the road as sort of a traveling concert, played on large screens at high volumes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a precursor to IMAX in many ways. However the original film suffered from poor editing and sound problems. Those have since been fixed, as Queen now owns the rights to the film, which has been restored from the original negative and presented in newly mixed and remastered DTS Surround Sound.\n\n\n\n\nScreen: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/4113/snapshot20071222010041tm3.th.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/4113/snapshot20071222010041tm3.th.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/6766/snapshot20071222010108ul6.th.jpg\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/3498/snapshot20071222010413ho7.th.jpg\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/628/snapshot20071222010318hc7.th.jpg\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/3625/snapshot20071222010346eg4.th.jpg\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nInfo:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 23GB (BD-25)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ VC-1\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1920x1080 (1:78:1)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 23.976 fps\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DTS-HD 5.1 3018 Kb/s\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ LPCM 2.0 2304 Kb/s\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DD2.0 Commentary track 192 Kb/s\n\nQuality: HDTV\nVideo Codec: VC1\nAudio Codec: DTS HD 5.1\nAudio Codec: LPCM\nAudio Codec: DD 2.0\nVideo: VC1 Video 1920x1080 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 22-27K ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 23.976 fps\nAudio: DTS HD 5.1 - 3018 Kbps\nAudio: LPCM 2.0 - 2304 Kbps\nAudio: DD 2.0 - 192 Kbps \n____________________\n\n1.Bonus Live\nVideo: Mpeg 2 Video ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 6K ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\nAudio: LPCM 2.0 - 2304 Kbps\nAudio: DTS HD 5.1 - ~5000 Kbps\n____________________\n\n2.Bonus Live + Interview\nVideo: Mpeg 2 Video ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 7K ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\nAudio: LPCM 2.0 - 2304 Kbps\n______________\n\n3.
