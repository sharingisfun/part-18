An oath determines his next step 'as a soul'.\n\n\nPLOT:\n\nTokyo's nasty underside, seen primarily through the eyes of Oscar, a heavy drug user, whose sister Linda is a stripper. Oscar also has flashbacks to his childhood when trauma upends the siblings. Oscar's drug-fed hallucinations alter Tokyo's already-disconcerting nights, and after the police shoot him, he can float above and look down: on his sister's sorrow, on the rooms of a love hotel, and on life \nat even a molecular level. The spectrum's colors can be beautiful; it's people's colorless lives that can be ugly. \n\nAnd what of afterlife, is there more than a void? \n\nEnjoy as always'\n\ncheublawm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da379d102087f0546a7d05d74a37d29fbe84770d","amp;dn":"ENTER+THE+VOID+%5B2009%5D+XVID+by+cheublawm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da379d102087f0546a7d05d74a37d29fbe84770d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,55,157,16,32,135,240,84,106,125,5,215,74,55,210,159,190,132,119,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
