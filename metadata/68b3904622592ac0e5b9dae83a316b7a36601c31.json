The film stars a large ensemble cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a thief who commits corporate espionage by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to regain his old life as payment for a task considered to be impossible: &quot;inception&quot;, the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.[6]\nShortly after finishing Insomnia (2002),[7] Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment about &quot;dream stealers&quot; and presented the idea to Warner Bros., envisioned as a horror film inspired by lucid dreaming.[8] Feeling he needed to have more experience with large-scale film production, Nolan retired the project and instead worked on Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), and The Dark Knight (2008).[9] He spent six months polishing the script before Warner Bros. purchased it in February 2009.[10] Inception was filmed in six countries and four continents, beginning in Tokyo on June 19, 2009, and finishing in Canada on November 22, 2009.[11] Its official budget was US$160 million, a cost which was split between Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures.[4] Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film's $100 million in advertising expenditure,[4] with most of the publicity involving viral marketing.\nInception premiered in London on July 8, 2010, and was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on July 16, 2010.[12][13] A box office success, Inception has grossed over $800 million worldwide becoming one of the highest-grossing films of all time.[5] The home video market also had strong results, with $68 million in DVD sales. Inception has received wide critical acclaim and numerous critics have praised its originality, cast, score, and visual effects.[14] It won Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Cinematography, and was also nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Art Direction.\n\nInception: Music from the Motion Picture is the soundtrack to the 2010 film of the same name directed by Christopher Nolan, released under Reprise Records on July 13, 2010. Hans Zimmer scored the film, marking his third collaboration with Nolan following Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b3904622592ac0e5b9dae83a316b7a36601c31","amp;dn":"Inception+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b3904622592ac0e5b9dae83a316b7a36601c31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,179,144,70,34,89,42,192,229,185,218,232,58,49,107,122,54,96,28,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
