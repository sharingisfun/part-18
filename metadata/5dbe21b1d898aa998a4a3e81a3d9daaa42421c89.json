It was released by Arista Records in 1977 and re-released on CD in 1984 and 2007. I Robot is an art rock album that draws conceptually on author Isaac Asimov's science fiction Robot trilogy, exploring philosophical themes regarding artificial intelligence.\n\nGeneral:\n\nArtist       : Alan Parsons Project, The\nAlbum        : I Robot\nGenre        : Progressive Rock\nYear         : 1977\nLabel        : Arista\nTracks       : 10\nPlaytime     : 00:41:08\nSize         : 94.78 MB\nCodec        : MPEG 1 Layer III / Lame 3.97 / 320 kbps\n\nEncoded from:\n\nLabel\t     :Arista Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ARCD 8040\nFormat       :CD, Album, Reissue\nCountry      :US\nReleased     :Oct 1990 \n\nTrack List:\n\n01.

Genesis Ch. 1, V. 32 (03:24)\n\nConcept:\n\nThe album was intended to be based on the I, Robot stories written by Asimov, and Woolfson actually spoke with Asimov, who was enthusiastic about the idea. As the rights already had been granted to a TV/movie company, the album's title was altered slightly by removing the comma, and the theme and lyrics were made to be more generically about robots rather than specific to the Asimov universe.\n\nThe cover inlay read: &quot;I Robot... The story of the rise of the machine and the decline of man, which paradoxically coincided with his discovery of the wheel... and a warning that his brief dominance of this planet will probably end, because man tried to create robot in his own image.&quot;\n\nThe title of the final track, &quot;Genesis Ch.1 v.32,&quot; follows this theme by implying a continuation to the story of Creation, since the first chapter of Genesis only has 31 verses.\n\nThe album cover photo of the band members is of the criss-crossing escalator tubes in the circular Terminal 1 building of Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris. Over this is superimposed a painting of a robot with a stylized atom for a brain. The original vinyl release had a gatefold-style cover; the inside spread had printed the lyrics for the non-instrumental selections and a monochrome photograph of Parsons himself.\n\nThe album was recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios, London, between December 1976 and March 1977. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbe21b1d898aa998a4a3e81a3d9daaa42421c89","amp;dn":"The++Alan+Parsons+Project+-+I+Robot+-+1977+%28MP3-320kbps%29-%5B%3DFaith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbe21b1d898aa998a4a3e81a3d9daaa42421c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,190,33,177,216,152,170,153,138,74,62,129,163,217,218,170,66,66,28,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
