Working with vice squad detectives, Hill takes on tough and seemingly impenetrable cases in an attempt to track down the killers before they strike again.\n\nSet in the fictional Yorkshire town of Bradfield, the show is a fast-paced and thrilling ride that borders on the surreal, adding an additional measure of intensity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee4fbfa28f0c653519abfd3c89de9f2ef3cf4e7a","amp;dn":"Wire+in+the+Blood+Seasons+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee4fbfa28f0c653519abfd3c89de9f2ef3cf4e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,79,191,162,143,12,101,53,25,171,253,60,137,222,159,46,243,207,78,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
