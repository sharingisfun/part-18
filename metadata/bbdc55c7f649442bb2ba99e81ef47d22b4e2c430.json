Meadow and Carrie have everything in commonâ€”except their views on sex, power, movie-making, and morality. Their lives collide with Jelly, a loner whose most intimate experience is on the phone. Jelly is older, erotic, and mysterious. She cold calls powerful men and seduces them not through sex but through listening. She invites them to reveal themselves, and they do.\r\n\r\nSpiotta is â€œa wonderfully gifted writer with an uncanny feel for the absurdities and sadnesses of contemporary life, and an unerring ear for how people talk and try to cope todayâ€ (The New York Times). Innocents and Others is her greatest novelâ€”wise, artful, and beautiful","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbdc55c7f649442bb2ba99e81ef47d22b4e2c430","amp;dn":"Innocents+and+Others_+A+Novel+-+Dana+Spiotta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbdc55c7f649442bb2ba99e81ef47d22b4e2c430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,220,85,199,246,73,68,43,178,186,153,232,30,244,125,34,180,226,196,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
