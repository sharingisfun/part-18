It has also been sold to China, and it remains in service in significant numbers. Yefim Gordon, the doyen of Russian aviation writers, continues to amass an outstanding archive of previously unpublished materials.\n\nThough the MiG-31 was covered to some extent in the now out-of- print and sought-after Aerofax on the MiG-25 and -31, this new book will be close to a definitive work on this important aircraft and include an enormous amount of newly released and acquired information and a splendid array of unpublished photographs (including detailed walk-around shots) and drawings. The narrative of course includes detailed discussion of the background to the project, its development, versions, service, weaponry, and comparisons with its contemporaries such as the F-14 Tomcat. The aircraft is a favorite with enthusiasts and modelers, and the extensive coverage, both technical and operational, backed up by high-quality images and drawings, will have wide appeal. This book was the first of an occasional series of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“in-depthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ monographs on major Russian types.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0176658558ac88cb30940a7e5693385bed5b4ce","amp;dn":"Famous+Russian+Aircraft+-+Mikoyan+MiG-31+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0176658558ac88cb30940a7e5693385bed5b4ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,23,102,88,85,138,200,140,179,9,64,167,229,105,51,133,190,213,180,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
