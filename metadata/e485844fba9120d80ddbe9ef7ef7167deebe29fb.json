Although a \ncommunist, Ira became a star in radio theater. Personal conflicts with \nhis wife, McCarthyite politicians, a gossip columnist, and his \ndaughter-addled and manipulative wife all combine to destroy Ira and \nmany of those around him.\n\nSome reviewers, consider the character of Eve Frame ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ antisemitic wife \nwho destroys Ira ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to be a barely disguised retort at Roth's ex-wife, \nClaire Bloom, for her unflattering memoirs which portray a Roth unable \nto bottle his vanity and incapable of living in the same household with \nBloom's daughter, Anna Steiger.\n - - -\n\nAmazon Review:\n\nIra Ringold is a self-educated radio actor, married to a spoilt, \nrags-to-riches beauty, silent-film star Eve Frame (Chave Fromkin). \nHe is a Communist, and a &quot;sucker for suffering,&quot; locked into the cycle \nof violence from which he has emerged. She has risen by assiduous \nimitation of what is &quot;classy&quot;--which seems to include a wide swathe of \nanti-Semitism--and ultimately denounces her husband as a Soviet spook. \nAnd who would be the narrator of this McCarthy-era meltdown? None other \nthan Philip Roth's longtime alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, who learns the \nfull tragedy several decades later, owing to a chance encounter with \nIra's brother: &quot;I'm the only person living who knows Ira's story,&quot; \n90-year-old Murray Ringold tells Nathan, &quot;you're the only person still \nliving who cares about it.&quot;\n\nCharacteristically, Nathan also discovers that his own story was bound \nup with the blacklistings and ruined careers of the immediate postwar \nperiod. It seems that he had been tainted by his association with the \nRingolds--Murray was in fact his high-school teacher--and was denied \nthe Fulbright scholarship he deserved. &quot;They had you down for Ira's \nnephew,&quot; Murray tells Nathan. &quot;The FBI didn't always get everything \nright.&quot; Roth's acerbic style and keen eye for emotional detail goes to \nthe heart of this moment of high tragedy in which the American dream \nwas damaged beyond repair.\n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n&gt;&gt;I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e485844fba9120d80ddbe9ef7ef7167deebe29fb","amp;dn":"I+MARRIED+A+COMMUNIST+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+Ron+Silver+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e485844fba9120d80ddbe9ef7ef7167deebe29fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,133,132,79,186,145,32,216,13,219,233,239,126,247,22,125,238,190,41,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
