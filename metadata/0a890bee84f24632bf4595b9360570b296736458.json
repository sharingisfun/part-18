The Honeydripper in February 1961 nailed the sound. It was a quartet date (with Ben Dixon on drums) and remains McDuff and Forrest's finest summit. \n\nBy the time 1961 rolled around, Forrest and McDuff were solid jazz-soul players. Four of the six tracks on The Honeydripper are magnificent blues that give both artists plenty of room to work out lines. The bonus here is Grant Green, whose solos and comp lines give the album extra energy.\n\nThe Honey Dripper (as the original song was known) has an interesting history. The song was written by Joe Liggins in the early 1940s. It was recorded by Liggins in March 1945 on two sides of a 78 rpm and became a hit &quot;race record,&quot; remaining at No. 1 for 18 weeks. The Honey Dripper is often credited as heavily influencing the development of R&amp;B and early Rock 'n' Roll. The tune is based on Shortnin' Bread, and Liggins' words played off the title's slang meaningÃ¢â‚¬â€a guy who was a big-time charmer. When McDuff and Forrest took on the song in 1961, they updated it with a funky backbeat.\n\nThe standards on the album are I Want a Little Girl and Mr. Lucky, and both are treated as blowing tunes. Mr. Lucky in particular features McDuff's swirling technique on the keyboards leavened with plenty of vibrato. Forrest, for his part, plays the perfect foil with lines that resolve beautifully. \n\nThe Honeydripper is one of the finest organ-sax combo albums ever recorded.\n\n\n\n\nJACK McDUFF\n\nThe Honeydripper 1961\n\nCD / 2006 / Remastered  / 320Kbps\n\n \n\nTracklist:\n1.
