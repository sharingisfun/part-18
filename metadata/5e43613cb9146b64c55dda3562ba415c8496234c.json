Encyclopedia of Television Film Directors brings attention to the directors of these productions, citing every director of stand alone long-form television programs: made for TV movies, movie-length pilots, mini-series, and feature-length anthology programs, as well as drama, comedy, and musical specials of more than 60 minutes.\n\nEach of the nearly 2,000 entries provides a brief career sketch of the director, his or her notable works, awards, and a filmography. Many entries also provide brief discussions of key shows, movies, and other productions. Appendixes include Emmy Awards, DGA Awards, and other accolades, as well as a list of anthology programs. A much-needed reference that celebrates these often-neglected artists, Encyclopedia of Television Film Directors is an indispensable resource for anyone interested in the history of the medium.\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nFrom Booklist\nEach of the nearly 2,000 entries in this alphabetical listing of Ã¢â‚¬Å“long-formÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ television film directors presents vital statistics (in most cases) along with a list of notable films and some brief commentary. The individuals who are covered are directors of stand-alone television shows of more than one hour in length, including movie-length pilots. Longer episodes of shows with continuing series characters are not included, although reunion movies are. Coverage ranges from the 1950s to 2008. The work begins with a lengthy and informative introduction, and entries are followed by six appendixes. An awards chronology lists directorial achievements for the Emmy, DGA, BAFTA, Golden Globe, Peabody, and Christopher. Appendix 2 is a list of great directors overall and by decade. This is followed by two appendixes connecting directors to Ã¢â‚¬Å“bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ movies, miniseries, and shows; and to genres and selected writers, historical figures, and actors and actresses. Appendix 5 lists anthology series such as Great Performances and provides a few examples of specific programs and their directors. Appendix 6 is a chronological listing of director credits for British imports such as Masterpiece Theatre. Demonstrating RobertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ long career contributing to publications related to the film and television industry, this is a valuable addition to any collection serving a film- or television-studies program. --Sara Marcus\n\nReview\nThis is a reasonable contribution to the literature of this oft-neglected form. Recommended. (CHOICE, December 2009)\n\nA valuable addition to any collection serving a film or television studies program, this work will also serve the larger general collection in which patrons wish to know more about directors, awards, and actors and actresses. (American Reference Books Annual)\n\nDemonstrating RobertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ long career contributing to publications related to the film and television industry, this is a valuable addition to any collection serving a film- or television-studies program. (Booklist, November 2009)\n\nThe level of detail achieved in certain entries is awesome in its scrutiny and analysisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.There can be no doubt that this is a bold entry into a poorly served area of film and media studies. It is therefore easy to see this volume's potential as an addition to enhance the print collection of materials supporting film studies or television production. The fact that so much care and attention has gone into crafting each entry lends an imposing and confident tone to the publication.
