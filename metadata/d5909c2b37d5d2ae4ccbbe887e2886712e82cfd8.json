Deep in the Mexican countryside, he pulls over for a sizzling roadside snackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½chicken grilled on an improvised oil-drum barbecue; then he shows us how to bring the idea home with a recipe for Roadside Whole Chicken with Knob Onions grilled on his backyard barbecue. At bustling El Farolito in Mexico City, Rick gives us the lowdown on another Mexican fire-cooked favorite: Tacos al PastorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½succulent pork, grilled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgyros-styleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on a vertical spit with pineapple. And that gets his appetite working for easy Chorizo, Potato and Mushroom Tacos made in his outdoor kitchen in Chicago. Then itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a visit to the mother church of meat and fire, El Canelo, an over-the top outdoor restaurant in Guadalajara built around a giant fire-pit, where pork, lamb, and other succulent meats are slow-roasted on spears around a crackling fire and every meal is a fiesta with dancers and live mariachi music. Inspired by all this heat and meat, Rick shares his technique for making Carne Asada, marinated beef, on his backyard grill.\n\n* Video Codec : H.264(MPEG-4 AVC)\n* Video Bitrate : 1536kbps\n* Aspect Ratio : 1.778\n* Audio Codec : AAC\n* Audio Bitrate : 128kbps\n* Runtime : ~23 mins\n* Resoution : 848x480\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5909c2b37d5d2ae4ccbbe887e2886712e82cfd8","amp;dn":"Mexico.One.Plate.at.a.Time.With.Rick.Bayless.S04E03.Quest.for.Fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5909c2b37d5d2ae4ccbbe887e2886712e82cfd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,144,156,43,55,213,210,174,76,203,190,136,126,40,134,113,46,130,207,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
