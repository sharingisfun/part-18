Manhattan lavatory attendant, Tom Ripley, borrows a Princeton jacket to play piano at a garden party. When the wealthy father of a recent Princeton grad chats Tom up, Tom pretends to know the son and is soon offered $1,000 to go to Italy to convince Dickie Greenleaf to return home. In Italy, Tom attaches himself to Dickie and to Marge, Dickie's cultured fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, pretending to love jazz and harboring homoerotic hopes as he soaks in luxury. Besides lying, Tom's talents include impressions and forgery, so when the handsome and confident Dickie tires of Tom, dismissing him as a bore, Tom goes to extreme lengths to make Greenleaf's privileges his own.\n\n \n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134119/\nGenre: Crime | Drama | Thriller\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: Mpeg-2 Transport Stream\nFile size: 3.99 Gb\nDuration: 2h 19mn\n\n\n \n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nAverage video bitrate: 3.5 Mbps\nFrame Rate: 29.97 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1\nResolution: 1920x1080\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AC3\nBitrate: 640 kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\n \n[IMG]http://i857.photobucket.com/albums/ab134/bricktophd/mr1.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i857.photobucket.com/albums/ab134/bricktophd/mr2.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i857.photobucket.com/albums/ab134/bricktophd/mr3.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i857.photobucket.com/albums/ab134/bricktophd/mr4.png[/IMG]\n\n[b]PLEASE HELP SEED SO OTHERS CAN ENJOY THE MOVIE[/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c15aa856f046556a47cf708b75231679d0028ad","amp;dn":"The.Talented.Mr.Ripley.%281999%29.1080p.AC3.5.1ch.Blu-ray.PS3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c15aa856f046556a47cf708b75231679d0028ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,21,170,133,111,4,101,86,164,124,247,8,183,82,49,103,157,0,40,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
