That neither LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chief collaborator Eric Erlandson nor her lieutenant Melissa Auf der Maur is to be found on this purported reunion is of no serious commercial consequence -- for most observers, Courtney Love was Hole just like Debbie Harry was Blondie, her supporting cast seemingly meaning little to the end product. Of course, the ironic thing is that Love is more dependent on the kindness of others than most singer/songwriters, her work taking on the characteristics of her collaborators -- and in the case of NobodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Daughter, they include longtime (and now former) friend Billy Corgan and Michael Beinhorn, two of the architects behind 1998ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Celebrity Skin, the one time Courtney came close to being the genuine crossover rock star she so desperately craves to be. Trace elements of the SoCal sheen of Skin can catch the light on NobodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Daughter, but despite its billing as a Hole album, this record wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t conceived as a band effort: its genesis is as the second Love solo album and it canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t shake its inward-leaning singer/songwriter roots no matter how many times a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSkinny Little BitchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is grafted onto the final product. That affected snarl was pulled as the first single in hopes of selling the album as a return to rock, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impossible to disguise the turgid tuneless folk-rock swirl at the heart of NobodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Daughter. By swapping guitar armies and clobbering hooks for muddled midtempo ballads, Courtney is placing more weight on her lyrics than she perhaps should given that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plowing familiar fields, painting herself as either a martyr or survivor (going so far as to quote Scarlett OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Hara in the concluding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNever Go HungryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), two personas that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite jibe with the image sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relentlessly pushed into the spotlight. Naturally, art should stand separate from the artist, but Courtney Love has never made that easy, blurring all lines between the public and private, turning all judgments on her art into a referendum on her. And in the case of NobodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Daughter, the tattered, ragged survivor in the gossip rags is no different than the one on record, both capturing Courtney in an inevitable, not so romantic decline, inadvertently turning every clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© into truth as she slowly slips into her final role as alt-rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Norma Desmond.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Nobody's Daughter\n02.Skinny Little Bitch\n03.Honey\n04.Pacific Coast Highway\n05.Samantha\n06.Someone Else's Bed\n07.For Once In Your Life\n08.Letter To God\n09.Loser Dust\n10.How Dirty Girls Get Clean\n12.Never Go Hungry\n\n\nCheers!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48aff911d46ac2600a483d8380c5e1f0fc19c035","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Nobody%5C%27s+Daughter+%282010%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48aff911d46ac2600a483d8380c5e1f0fc19c035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,175,249,17,212,106,194,96,10,72,61,131,128,197,225,240,252,25,192,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
