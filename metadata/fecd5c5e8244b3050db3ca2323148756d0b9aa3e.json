Hopefully you can enjoy it regardless of the quality :)\n\nSadly the restoration process did remove some of the artificial reverb someone had added to it. For some reason someone in V2 Records must have decided that a soundboard-sourced recording needed some ambience, because on parts when Jack is just singing, they added a massive reverb -.-, while only putting mild reverb on the rest.\n\nAlso, I included a perspective-corrected pic of the vinyl cover (original pic also posted by herbman75)\n\nIf you want to know more about this release, check out the following included files:\n\noriginal info.txt is the info uploaded with the original (unrestored) torrent on thepiratebay.\ntracks.txt is a list taken from whitestripes.com, detailing the gig. I added track numbers and showed the split between vinyl sides.\nrestoration.txt is an almost complete list of what I did to restore this (read if you dare, for some of it even I don't know what I was writing, but it must have been important at the time).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[/blank release]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fecd5c5e8244b3050db3ca2323148756d0b9aa3e","amp;dn":"The+White+Stripes+-+Live+In+Las+Vegas+vinyl+rip+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fecd5c5e8244b3050db3ca2323148756d0b9aa3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,205,92,94,130,68,179,5,13,179,202,35,35,20,135,86,208,185,170,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
