Each play has been animated in it own unique style by the exceptional talents of the leading directors of Russia's Christmas Films. Actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company and stars of stage and screen, including Antony Sher, Joss Ackland and Jenny Agutter, provide voices for the characters which were recorded and produced by BBC Wales. In Russia, art and animation has long been used as a veiled form of satire, education and political protest. This has inspired scores of Russian animators to develop fascinating and highly individual techniques, a prolific kaleidoscope of styles from which the animation artists were chosen for these stories of Shakespeare-The Animated Tales.\nSuitable for homeschool.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7937a621c7431385408d9d9fdd2411b02c543a3","amp;dn":"Shakespeare+The+Animated+Tales+vol.+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7937a621c7431385408d9d9fdd2411b02c543a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,147,122,98,28,116,49,56,84,8,217,217,253,210,65,27,2,197,67,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
