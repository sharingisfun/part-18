His starring role in The Two Ronnies has earned him a chapter in the book of all-time comedy greats. But who knew of his first screen role in You're Only Young Twice, or that six episodes of Two Ronnies were made in Australia?\r\n\r\nLike many of his generation, Ronnie had a strong career on stage and was 36 before his first big television break. That was on the groundbreaking Frost Report - a live tinder box of comedy talent that also introduced John Cleese and Ronnie Barker. Ronnie's comedy is still vibrant. Show business has refused to let him stop working. \r\n\r\nThe list of his modern-day collaborators is both lengthy and impressive. Expect to see favourite moments and many surprises in The Many Faces of Ronnie Corbett.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/26/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/The-Many-Faces-of-Ronnie-Corbett-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1760Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25.0 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.49 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 797 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06tkh39 \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03pr3g2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac2c153b709fac1ccaadb84d950affb15ed4054e","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Many+Faces+of+Ronnie+Corbett+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac2c153b709fac1ccaadb84d950affb15ed4054e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,44,21,59,112,159,172,28,202,173,184,77,149,10,255,177,94,212,5,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
