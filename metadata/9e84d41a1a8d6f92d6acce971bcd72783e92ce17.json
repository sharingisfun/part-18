This may be the simplest, most powerful technology for unleashing the hidden powers of the mind.\n\nA VACATION IN 28 MINUTES\n\nAs I plugged it into my stereo player, I kept thinking, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a recording.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then I put on my headphones, flipped the switch, and woosh...I was transported into another time and place. My body became extremely relaxed. My arms and legs felt numb. I started having long conversations with a voice inside my head, experiencing vivid memories, and a flood of creative ideas. It seemed as if my mind and body were in two separate places. Words can hardly describe the experience but it was like taking a two-week vacation in 28 minutes.\n\nGIVE YOUR BRAIN A RIDE\n\nPerhaps one of the great untold discoveries of our time is the knowledge of how to manipulate the energies of consciousnessÃ¢â‚¬â€to unleash the true potential of a human being. For thousands of years the only way to achieve enlightened awareness was through meditation. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where this new audio technology steps in.\n\nTHE ULTRA MEDITATION TRANSCENDENCE SYSTEM\n\nUltra Meditation was designed to open the mind to greater levels of awareness, by driving consciousness inward and feeding the brain with a steady flow of psychic energy. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how it works.\n\nLevel 1: The Beginning Theta Mind Experience\n\nClose your eyes--feel your body relax. Your arms and legs become limp as outside distraction melt away. Attention is focused inward and you experience profound feelings of peace and serenity. As your awareness expands, your mind explores the possibilites of this altered state known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“theta consciousness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Based on altered states research and the study of meditation, this is a powerful tool for shifting the energies of consciousness and unfolding a state of meditative awareness.\n\nLevel 2: Transformation Going Beyond Theta\n\nThe powerful audio matrix pulls your consciousness into deep and profound relaxation. As your mind focuses inward, your body feels incredibly light--floating free from its earthly bounds. Fantastic imagery flashes across your internal universe. Complex patterns of light and sound pulse through your mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye. You feel an inexplicable internal shift--and suddenly you are beyond the beginning stage of meditation--outside yourself, witnessing your shift in consciousness. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve opened the doorway into eternity and are one with your higher self.\n\nLevel 3: Awareness The Delta Experience\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 50,000 years ago, and you are deep in the remote outback of Australia. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re alone. Yet you feel safe--connected to the beauty around you. Off in the distance you hear whispers from some ancient time, set adrift upon the wind. They become stronger and beckon to you. You feel yourself lifting off and disappearing into the sounds of the night. A few moments (or perhaps an eternity) later you awaken refreshed--feeling more alive than ever. This amazing program guides you through complex layers of subsonic textures and delivers a different experience each time you do it.\n\nLevel 4: Cetacean Mind Link The Dolphin &amp; Whale Experience\n\nImagine you are a cetacean (whale or dolphin) swimming the oceans. You have no enemies, plenty of food, and are unaffected by the climate above. Your brain is the largest on the planet and your body is perfectly adapted to your water environment. Most of your time is spent socalizing, eating, making love, and raising your children. Enter this perfect water world and prepare to return to land with a new perspective about life on Planet Earht. This acoustical landscape puts your consciousness directly into a cetaceanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind and stimulates a special meditation experience that evokes deep emotional responses and memories about our water planet.\n\nLevel 5: Near Death Experience Beyond &amp; Back\n\nYou feel yourself leaving your body. No fear. Voices beckoning you. You begin to review your life. A lightness of being and a bliss surrounds you as you begin to ascend. Eternity is everywhere. Moving faster towards infinity you pierce the veil, and seeing the light, you cross over. Feel the warmth--the love--the eternal peace. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to return--alive and renewed. This unique program drives your consciousness through the 5 stages of a near death simulation, and then brings you back recharged and enlivened.\n\nBonuses:\n\nHealing Music Library (8 CD's)\nHow to Find Your Mission in Life\nMind Power Secrets\nThe Secret of Living a Perfect Life\nTranscendental Mind Series (9 CD's)\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nAll tracks secure rips &amp; AccurateRip verified.
