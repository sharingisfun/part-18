Some people won't get it, and that's fine. Art is subjective and we all have different tastes. But I can't recommend enough that those who have trusted my recommendations in the past give this one a chance.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBig Questions\n\nAnders Nilsen\n\nDrawn and Quarterly, 2011, 658 pages\n\nA New York Times Notable Book of 2011, included onPublishers Weekly, and  NPRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S Best Comics lists\n\nA haunting postmodern fable, Big Questions is the magnum opus of Anders Nilsen, one of the brightest and most talented young cartoonists working today. This beautiful minimalist story, collected here for the first time, is the culmination of ten years and more than six hundred pages of work that details the metaphysical quandaries of the occupants of an endless plain, existing somewhere between a dream and a Russian steppe. A downed plane is thought to be a bird and the unexploded bomb that came from it is mistaken for a giant egg by the group of birds whose lives the story follows. The indifferent, stranded pilot is of great interest to the birdsÃ¢â‚¬â€some doggedly seek his approval, while others do quite the opposite, leading to tensions in the group. Nilsen seamlessly moves from humor to heartbreak. His distinctive, detailed line work is paired with plentiful white space and large, often frameless panels, conveying an ineffable sense of vulnerability and openness.\n\nBig Questions has roots in classic fablesÃ¢â‚¬â€the birds and snakes have more to say than their human counterparts, and there are hints of the heroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey, but here the easy moral that closes most fables is left open and ambiguous. Rather than lending its world meaning, NilsenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parable lets the questions wander where they will.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c1147b174b92e70e1429adbd62757579915b9be","amp;dn":"Anders+Nilsen+-+Big+Questions+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c1147b174b92e70e1429adbd62757579915b9be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,17,71,177,116,185,46,112,225,66,154,219,214,39,87,87,153,21,185,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
