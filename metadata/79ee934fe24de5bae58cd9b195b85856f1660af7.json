Matter occupied so tiny a part of his vast awareness that humans were utterly beneath his notice.The colonists of Newmanhome first suffered the effects of Wan-To's games when their planet's stars began to shift, the climate began to cool down, and the colony was forced into a desperate struggle to survive.\n\nViktor Sorricaine was determined to discover what force had suddenly sent his world hurtling toward the ends of the universe.
