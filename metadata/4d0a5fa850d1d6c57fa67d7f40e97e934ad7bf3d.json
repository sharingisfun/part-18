He wrote influential books on the young science of psychology, educational psychology, psychology of religious experience and mysticism, and the philosophies of pragmatism and Radical Empiricism.\n\nEssays in Radical Empiricism is a collection edited and published posthumously by his colleague and biographer Ralph Barton Perry in 1912. It was assembled from a collection of reprinted journal articles published from 1904ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1905 which James had deposited in August 1906 at Harvard University, for supplemental use by his students.\n\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d0a5fa850d1d6c57fa67d7f40e97e934ad7bf3d","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Essays+in+Radical+Empiricism+by+William+James","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d0a5fa850d1d6c57fa67d7f40e97e934ad7bf3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,10,95,168,80,209,214,197,127,166,125,127,64,233,126,147,74,215,191,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
