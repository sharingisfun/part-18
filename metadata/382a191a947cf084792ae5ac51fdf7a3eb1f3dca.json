Urbanites everywhere, from ironic hipsters to earth-conscious commuters, are taking to the bike like aquatic mammals to water. BikeSnobNYC cycling's most prolific, well-known, hilarious, and anonymous blogger brings a fresh and humorous perspective to the most important vehicle to hit personal transportation since the horse. Bike Snob treats readers to a laugh-out-loud rant and rave about the world of bikes and their riders, and offers a unique look at the ins and outs of cycling, from its history and hallmarks to its wide range of bizarre practitioners. Throughout, the author lampoons the missteps, pretensions, and absurdities of bike culture while maintaining a contagious enthusiasm for cycling itself. Bike Snob is an essential volume for anyone who knows, is, or wants to become a cyclist.\n\n---\n\nBe sure to register at forum.suprbay and post your books requests so more people will see it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:382a191a947cf084792ae5ac51fdf7a3eb1f3dca","amp;dn":"Bike+Snob+NYC+%28req%3Atricky10601%29+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"382a191a947cf084792ae5ac51fdf7a3eb1f3dca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,42,25,26,148,124,240,132,121,42,229,172,81,253,247,163,235,31,61,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
