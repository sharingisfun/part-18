Working together with his friend J.D. King, Yorn has never sounded better. For their debut self-titled album, Yorn and King wrote the songs as a team, trade off vocals, and play all the instruments. Together they've crafted an album that's extremely organic and relaxed, with layers of acoustic and electric instruments creating a nice warmth and giving the sound some depth. King especially helps fill out the arrangements as he shows prowess on a wide range of instruments, including jew's harp, clarinet, cello, and concertina. Pitched somewhere between easygoing country rock and simple '60s pop, the songs have plenty of hooks and rambling charm. A couple tracks (the bubblegummy folk rocker &quot;Twice as Nice,&quot; the yearning &quot;Wanna Feel It&quot;) sound like what Wilco might have if they had no artistic pretensions; the ballads (&quot;Rise and Shine,&quot; &quot;Another Daydream') are filled with a carefully detailed ache, and the truly lovely &quot;Someone Else's Girl&quot; probably would have been a hit single in 1966. No matter the style of song, the guys sing of melanchony heartbreak and sadness, but in a casually resigned way that makes it seem like the pain is filtered through a pair of lightly tinted sunglasses. There's a very autumnal feel to the sound and the songs, made more impressive by the uncharacteristic restraint Yorn shows here. His vocals are very much of a piece of the sound instead of being way out front, and it suits him very well. King's vocal features are a little less successful, as his affected country drawl on &quot;She Said No&quot; is a little jarring. In fact, the entire song, with its tale of murder and woe, is a little out of place among the sweet and simple songs that surround it. It's a minor blip on an otherwise excellent album by two guys who have discovered the transformative power that can be derived from collaboration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bcd508aa136089a928f26398f3e52d11e7b6263","amp;dn":"The+Olms+-+The+Olms+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bcd508aa136089a928f26398f3e52d11e7b6263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,205,80,138,161,54,8,154,146,143,38,57,143,62,82,209,30,123,98,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
