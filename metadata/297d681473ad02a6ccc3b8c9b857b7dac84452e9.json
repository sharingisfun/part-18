Sick of seeing their environment ruined and their people exploited by the Panguna Mine, the Pacific island of Bougainville rose up against the giant mining corporation, Rio Tinto Zinc.\nThe newly formed Bougainville Revolutionary Army began fighting with bows and arrows and sticks and stones against a heavily armed adversary.\nIn an attempt to put down the rebellion the Papua New Guinean Army swiftly established a gunboat blockade around the island. But with no shipments allowed in or out, how did new electricity networks spring up on the island? And how were the people of Bougainville able to drive around the island without any source of petrol or diesel? \nWatch as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first eco-revolution unfolds within the blockade. A David and Goliath story for the 21st century. A multi-award winning documentary\n\nDirector: Dom Rotheroe\nYear:     2000\n\n\n\n\nOttopilot's info; When I originally downloaded this video, it had black borders and lengthy blank video running at the beginning and end, which I have edited out.
