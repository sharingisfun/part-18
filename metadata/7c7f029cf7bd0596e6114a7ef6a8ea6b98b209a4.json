He began at age 17 and has been referred to as &quot;Big boy&quot; because of his album of the same name. At the end of the sixties he and Herbert Noord (Hammond organ) founded a quartet that played saxophone/organ funk. He has done a good deal of cross-over jazz or jazz fusion and even worked with Punk rockers at one point. He has recorded an album with bassist Frank Wright titled &quot;El SaxofÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n&quot;. He has comparatively high popularity in Japan where Hyperbeat was a top-selling CD by instrumental standards. Furthermore Japanese film maker Masaaki Yuasa stated that he listened to Hans Dulfer's music while working on Mind Game.\n\nHans Dulfer is the father of saxophonist Candy Dulfer and the two worked together on the albums Dig and Dulfer Dulfer, of which the title is partly a reference to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nHans Dulfer - Tenor Sax\nCandy Dulfer - Alto Sax\nBoris Vanderlek - Tenor Sax\nPeter Broekhuizen - Tenor &amp; Bariton Sax\nDavid Rockenfeller - Trumpet &amp; Valve Trombone\nDavid Romney - Raps\nPaul Keuzenkamp - Guitars &amp; Keyboards\nHans Eijkenaar - Drums\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 - Digscussion No. 1\n02 - Dig!\n03 - Digstortion\n04 - Streetfire\n05 - Red Moon\n06 - Smooth\n07 - Grand Slam\n08 - Grand Slam Extension 1\n09 - Grand Slam Extension 2\n10 - Grand Slam Extension 3\n11 - Double Dutch\n12 - Moby Dig\n13 - Digscussion No. 2\n14 - Quickotones\n15 - Intro to\n16 - More Dig!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c7f029cf7bd0596e6114a7ef6a8ea6b98b209a4","amp;dn":"Hans+Dulfer+-+Dig++%5B1996%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c7f029cf7bd0596e6114a7ef6a8ea6b98b209a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,127,2,156,247,189,5,150,230,17,74,126,246,168,234,107,152,178,9,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
