In the past two decades, numerous advancesÃ¢â‚¬â€including the use of ionic liquidsÃ¢â‚¬â€have made it possible to develop substitutes for some toxic solvents.\n\nIonic liquids are widely recognized as suitable for use in organic reactions and can also improve the control of product distribution, enhanced reactivity, ease of product recovery, catalyst immobilization, and recycling.\nEnvironmentally Friendly Syntheses Using Ionic Liquids presents the latest developments in the field. It also reviews the latest applications in a wide range of fields including biotechnology, nuclear science, medicine, pharmaceuticals, environmental science, and organic and inorganic chemistryÃ¢â‚¬â€all from the standpoint of green sustainable chemistry.\n\nGrowing interest in the field of ionic liquids will define newer and unexplored areas of applications, expanding possible use of these environmentally friendly chemicals. The information presented in this book will undoubtedly help motivate readers to further explore the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aba37857b090bd727dfaf7d921b97d927e79ba0c","amp;dn":"Environmentally.Friendly.Syntheses.Using.Ionic.Liquids.BD.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aba37857b090bd727dfaf7d921b97d927e79ba0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,163,120,87,176,144,189,114,125,250,247,217,33,185,125,146,126,121,186,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
