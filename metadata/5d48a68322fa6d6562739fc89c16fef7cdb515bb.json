The audio was increased 5db since the original was pretty quiet. The original TrollHD release had a panel discussion tacked on at the end with Daniel Ellsberg, Max Frankel, Adam Liptak and Jill Abramson - this was removed so just the documentary remains in this release. The panel discussion can be viewed at the PBS POV website.\n\nSome say that the release of the Pentagon Papers is what sent Nixon over the top and ultimately led to the demise of his presidency. The story is fascinating and has many parallels to current events.\n\nPlease leave a comment if there are any issues with the editing and encode, thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d48a68322fa6d6562739fc89c16fef7cdb515bb","amp;dn":"MostDangerousManInAmerica%3ADanielEllsberg-ThePentagonPapers.720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d48a68322fa6d6562739fc89c16fef7cdb515bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,72,166,131,34,250,109,101,98,115,159,200,156,22,254,247,205,181,21,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
