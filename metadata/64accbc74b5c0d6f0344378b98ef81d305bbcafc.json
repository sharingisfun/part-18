One of the two sets of this +70 min was originally under guitarist Burrell's name).\n\nIn Moon Rappin' from 1969 McDuff expands the soul jazz palette with spatial and experimental textures over the groove that foreshadows a lot of the R&amp;B and fusion of the next decade.\n\nIn Down Home Style from 1969, McDuff went to Memphis to record this classic blend of soulful jazz and Memphis funk.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64accbc74b5c0d6f0344378b98ef81d305bbcafc","amp;dn":"Jack+McDuff+-+Jazz+organ+-+Hammond+organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64accbc74b5c0d6f0344378b98ef81d305bbcafc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,172,203,199,75,92,13,111,3,68,55,139,152,239,129,211,5,187,202,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
