The discovery of the CFTR gene 25 years ago set the stage for unraveling the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, continuous refinement of symptomatic treatments and the development of mutation-specific therapies, which are now becoming available for a subgroup of patients. This Monograph provides an update on all aspects of CF lung disease, from infancy to adulthood, including current concepts on the disease process, improvements in early diagnosis and monitoring, therapeutic approaches and patient care. In state-of the art chapters, this Monograph highlights important recent developments and discusses the next steps that will be required for further improvement of life expectancy and quality of life of patients with CF. It will be an essential reference for basic and clinical scientists and all members of the CF team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921f152a2490af73f33d4c8b3248c264b7d6da3e","amp;dn":"Cystic+Fibrosis+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921f152a2490af73f33d4c8b3248c264b7d6da3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,31,21,42,36,144,175,115,243,61,76,139,50,72,194,100,183,214,218,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
