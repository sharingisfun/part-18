By exploring the lives and discoveries of modern archaeologists excavating the site of Tell Makor, Michener vividly re-creates life in and around an ancient city during critical periods of its existence, and traces the profound history of the Jews, including that of the early Hebrews and their persecution, the impact of Christianity on the Jewish world, the Crusades, and the Spanish Inquisition. Michener weaves his epic tale of love, strength, and faith until at last he arrives at the founding of Israel and the modern conflict in the Middle East. The Source is not only a compelling history of the Holy Land and its people but a richly written saga that encompasses the development of Western civilization and the great religious and cultural ideas that have shaped our world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c11252ab45ea6cbe3b86c4b8658f9dc30e92a0bd","amp;dn":"The+Source+by+James+Michener","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c11252ab45ea6cbe3b86c4b8658f9dc30e92a0bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,18,82,171,69,234,108,190,59,134,196,184,101,143,157,195,14,146,160,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
