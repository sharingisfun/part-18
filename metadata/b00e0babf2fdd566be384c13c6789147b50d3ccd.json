They are one of the most successful and critically acclaimed bands of the twentieth century. Rolling Stone has described them as &quot;innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet galvanizing&quot; and has also declared that the band &quot;changed the sound of black pop&quot;.\n\nThe street came alive in '75. On a super stage a band of brothers in blood and spirit gathered the grooves of\nSly Stone, the inner vision of Stevie Wonder and the searching message of Marvin Gaye and blew them out to a hungry public. They fed them with the right to be mighty and invited them to share a happy feeling. Here on stage was the way of their world and a window of what our world could be. This is your ticket to a concert now playing for a new generation.\nTurn up the flame and feel the eternal fire....\n\nHappy feelings everybody....\n\nStereo 2.0 DFF tracks extracted from the the 2002 SACD with Scarletbook.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSACD-ISO-DFF-1Bit-2.8Mhz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b00e0babf2fdd566be384c13c6789147b50d3ccd","amp;dn":"Earth%2C+Wind+%26amp%3B+Fire+-+Alive+In+%2775+%281975%29+2002-SACD-DFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b00e0babf2fdd566be384c13c6789147b50d3ccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,14,11,171,242,253,213,102,190,56,76,19,198,120,145,71,181,13,60,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
