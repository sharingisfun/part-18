Also featuring Maurice Denham, Paul Eddington, David Jason, John Le Mesurier, Miriam Margolyes, Jonathan Cecil, Liza Goddard and Patrick Cargill. The Inimitable Jeeves - Aunt Agatha is forcing Bertie to get engaged to the formidable Honoria Glossop. Can Jeeves save the day? The Code of the Woosters - Who would think that a silver cow-creamer could cause so much trouble? Uncle Tom wants it, and Aunt Dahlia is blackmailing Bertie to steal it. Right Ho, Jeeves. Mayhem has broken out at Brinkley Court, but there are more brains in the Wooster household than just Jeeves...Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves - Poor Bertie! Madeline Bassett and Gussie Fink-Nottle's engagement is on the rocks, and he's next in line for the fair maiden's hand. Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit - When Jeeves returns from his annual shrimping holiday in Bognor Regis, he's in for a few surprises. Jeeves: Joy in the Morning - For Bertie, Steeple Bumphleigh is a village to be avoided as it contains the appalling Aunt Agatha. Still, there are good deeds to be done. '...a joy from first to last, delivered with absolutely the right lightness of touch, full of fun, trivial yes, but utterly enhanting' - &quot;Chichester Observer&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Jeeves-Wooster-Collected-Radio-Dramas/dp/140842679X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Jeeves-Wooster-Collected-Radio-Dramas/dp/140842679X&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc471cd23c1d7b61614fce4b62bf9a69962ddd7","amp;dn":"Jeeves+and+Wooster%2C+the+Collected+Radio+Dramas+%28BBC+Audio%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc471cd23c1d7b61614fce4b62bf9a69962ddd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,196,113,205,35,193,215,182,22,20,252,228,182,43,249,166,153,98,221,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
