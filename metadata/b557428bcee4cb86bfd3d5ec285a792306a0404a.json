The game is best known as the first video game based on Epic, a table-top wargame set in the fictional Warhammer 40,000 universe, in an attempt to recreate the table-top experience on a computer as opposed to using it as a backdrop for games in other genres. As a result, the game borrows heavily in terms of rules and style from the table-top game, demanding a combination of luck and tactics necessary to succeed in game warfare.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b557428bcee4cb86bfd3d5ec285a792306a0404a","amp;dn":"Warhammer+40k+Final+Liberation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b557428bcee4cb86bfd3d5ec285a792306a0404a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,87,66,139,206,228,203,134,191,211,213,236,40,90,121,35,6,160,64,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
