Although I've put in many days of work for this, none is my own scan so my thanks go to the original uploaders, no matter how bad their scanning skills or equipment, because without them there wouldn't be any material to begin with. \nAll the files are loose (no rars) so that you can pick and choose what you like. If what you already have is not of good quality, chances are that I have repaired it, so give it a try (download only a couple of images to check).\n\nI had to split the material in four parts. Therefore, look for Knit socks parts 1,2,3 and 4, as well as for Knit Slippers. I also have other knitting and crochet torrents - just click my username to see them\n \nIMPORTANT NOTE: I can only seed at night and I'm in Europe.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:094b68898ce66fe54f64f6ba20976165203fc70f","amp;dn":"Knit+socks+part+5+and+last","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"094b68898ce66fe54f64f6ba20976165203fc70f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,75,104,137,140,230,111,229,79,100,246,186,32,151,97,101,32,63,199,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
