They were all geniuses. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) was a successful litigator. His wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) raised their children to be ambitious, entrepreneurial, and creative--then published an acclaimed book about her child-rearing techniques. Adopted daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a gifted playwright. Son Chas (Ben Stiller) was a masterful businessman with a taste for real estate. And the other son, Richie (Luke Wilson), was a natural tennis champ. However, when Royal packed up his life and left his wife and his family in a cloud of betrayal, everything fell apart. Twenty years later, the Tenenbaums are a dejected and alienated bunch, each having found that their early successes did not carry over into adulthood. When washed-up Royal learns that his distant wife Etheline, who has become an archaeologist, may remarry, he feigns illness as an excuse to reunite with his estranged family.\n\nDVD9 a DVD5\n\nDvdDecrypter + DvDRebuilder + CCE (9 pass)\n\nBen Stiller&amp;#039;s Cycle at www.solodvd.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a2d9455b45019f1c5e7ff937d7d61e3ceeda26","amp;dn":"The+Royal+Tenenbaums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a2d9455b45019f1c5e7ff937d7d61e3ceeda26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,162,217,69,91,69,1,159,28,94,127,249,55,215,214,30,60,238,218,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
