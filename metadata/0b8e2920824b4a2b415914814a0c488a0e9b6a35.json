As the film notes, most Christians live their lives today without feeling obliged to kil anyone who works on the Sabbath or eats shrimp.\n\nThrough the experience of five very normal, very Christian , very American families - including those of former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and Episcopalian Bishop Gene Robinson - we discover how insightful people of faith handle the realization of having a gay child. With commentary by such respected voices as Bishop Desmond Tutu, Harvard's Peter Gomes, Orthodox Rabbi Steve Greenberg and Reverend Jimmy Creech, For The Bible Tells Me So offers healing, clarity and understanding to anyone caught in the crosshairs of scripture and sexual identity.\n\nFile Name ..........: For.The.Bible.Tells.Me.So.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.avi\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 1,493.02 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\n\nVideo Length .......: 01:38:48\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1888 KB/s\nResolution .........: 640 x 352\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.81:1\nFramerate ..........: 29.97 FPS\nQuality Factor .....: 0.279 B/px\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 224 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b8e2920824b4a2b415914814a0c488a0e9b6a35","amp;dn":"For.The.Bible.Tells.Me.So.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b8e2920824b4a2b415914814a0c488a0e9b6a35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,142,41,32,130,75,74,43,65,89,20,129,74,12,72,138,14,155,106,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
