It consists of three books: Text, Workbook for Students, and Manual for Teachers. The order in which students choose to use the books, and the ways in which they study them, depend on their particular needs and preferences.\n\n\nThe curriculum the Course proposes is carefully conceived and is explained, step by step, at both the theoretical and practical levels. It emphasizes application rather than theory, and experience rather than theology. Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many others, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end.\n\n\nThe Text is largely theoretical, and sets forth the concepts on which the Course's thought system is based. Its ideas contain the foundation for the Workbook's lessons. Without the practical application the Workbook provides, the Text would remain largely a series of abstractions which would hardly suffice to bring about the thought reversal at which the Course aims.\n\n\nThe Workbook includes 365 lessons, one for each day of the year. It is not necessary, however, to do the lessons at that tempo, and one might want to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day. The practical nature of the Workbook is underscored by the introduction to its lessons, which emphasizes experience through application rather than a prior commitment to a spiritual goal:\n\n\nSome of the ideas the workbook presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true.\n\n\nFinally, the Manual for Teachers, which is written in question and answer form, provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes a clarification of a number of the terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the Text.\n\n\nThe Course makes no claim to finality, nor are the Workbook lessons intended to bring the student's learning to completion. At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information....:\n\nFormat:...................: JPG Images\nVolume:...................: Combined\nEdition:..................: 3rd\nNumber Of Pages:..........: 1362\nISBN-10:..................: 9781883360245\nISBN-13:..................: 978-1883360245\nASIN:.....................: 1883360242\nImages Cropped:...........: NO\nCompiled PDF:.............: NO\nSearchable Text:..........: NO\nPages In Order:...........: NO\n\n\n\n+-----+\n|Notes|\n+-----+\n\n\n*** All pages should be present for anyone seeking the raw information. ***\n\n\n*** ItÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s quite unlikely that I will find the time to turn these scans into a PDF as I would have wanted to do in the first place! ***\n\n\n*** If anyone knows where to find a PDF of this e-book please post a link in the comments.
