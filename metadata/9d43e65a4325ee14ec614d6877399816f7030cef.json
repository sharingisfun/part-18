From their evolutionary roots to their flying, feeding, fighting, mating, nesting, and communicating, Tudge provocatively ponders what birds actually doÃ¢â‚¬â€œas well as why they do it and how. With the same curiosity, passion, and insight he brought to redwoods, pines, and palm trees in his widely acclaimed book The Tree, Tudge here studies sparrows, parrots, and even the Monkey-eating Eagle to better understand their worldÃ¢â‚¬â€œand our own.\nThere is far more to a bird's existence than gliding gracefully on air currents or chirping sweetly from fence postsÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe stakes are life and death. By observing and explaining the complex strategy that comes into play with everything from migration to social interaction to the timing of giving birth to young, Tudge reveals how birds are uniquely equipped biologically to succeed and survive. And he offers an impassioned plea for humans to learn to coexist with birds without continuing to endanger their survival.\nComplete with an &quot;annotated cast list&quot; of all the known birds in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€œ plus gorgeous illustrationsÃ¢â‚¬â€œThe Bird is a comprehensive and delightfully accessible guide for everyone from dedicated birders to casual birdwatchers that celebrates and illuminates the remarkable lives of birds.\n\nAbout the Author\nColin Tudge (born 22 April 1943) is a British science writer and broadcaster.
