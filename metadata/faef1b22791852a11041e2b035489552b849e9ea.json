That statement\n\nalone seems fantastic.  Not just jazz musicians but GREAT Jazz musicians.\n\n\nCharlie Mingus championed Thad Jones and offered his DEBUT label and his \n\nown artistic contribution.\n\n\nThis 1954 album was Thad's first.  It has undergone several modifications\n\nover the years.  There are actually two album releases here and two\n\nalternate takes.  Mostly I delete alternate takes, but these were \n\nworth ripping.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faef1b22791852a11041e2b035489552b849e9ea","amp;dn":"THAD+JONES%3B+The+Fabulous...%3B+MINGUS%3B+ROACH%3B+Debut+127","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faef1b22791852a11041e2b035489552b849e9ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,239,27,34,121,24,82,161,16,65,226,176,53,72,149,82,184,73,233,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
