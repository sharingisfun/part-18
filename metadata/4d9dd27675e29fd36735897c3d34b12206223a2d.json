Caught in the Crossfire.\nThe final part starts in 2009 and tells the story of 2nd Battalion Princess of Wales regiment as they come to terms with new rules of fighting brought in to protect civilians. Private Mike McCabe is filmed being shot in the leg during a Taliban ambush. By 2010, the Scots Guards find themselves fighting a very different war - a battle for hearts and minds. They struggle to train a local force, the Afghan National Police, who fight in a reckless and dangerous way. The risks are hammered home when Guardsman Daniel Clarke films a three-year-old girl who has been seriously injured by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by the ANP. The Scots Guards tour ends in tragedy when six members of the ANP are massacred in their sleep.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01175hg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01175hg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.776:1\nVideo Resolution: 1016x572\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 96 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 57 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 780 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: PDTV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d9dd27675e29fd36735897c3d34b12206223a2d","amp;dn":"BBC+Our+War+10+Years+in+Afghanistan+3of3+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d9dd27675e29fd36735897c3d34b12206223a2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,157,210,118,117,226,159,211,103,53,137,124,61,52,177,34,6,34,58,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
