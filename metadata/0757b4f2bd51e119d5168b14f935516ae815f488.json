As we know, great comics such as Tintin, Asterix and Lucky-Luke are originally phrancophone. Here is a great opportunity to have the whole collection of these three classics!\n\nTintin and Lucky-Luke books are in pdf format. For the Asterix comics you will need a comics client to open the files. They are.cbr files (official comic files extention).\n\nTintin and Asterix comics are in great shape and very good quality. The Lucky-Luke ones vary in quality, once they are more difficult to find.\nHowever, they are all in different folders. So you may keep what's interesting for you. But I organized them myself and I must say that it's pretty decent.\n\nMerci ÃƒÂ  tous! J'espÃƒÂ¨re que vous aimez!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0757b4f2bd51e119d5168b14f935516ae815f488","amp;dn":"Bandes+Dessin%26eacute%3Bes+Francophones+%5BCOMICS+COLLECTION%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0757b4f2bd51e119d5168b14f935516ae815f488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,87,180,242,189,81,225,25,213,22,139,20,249,53,81,106,232,21,244,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
