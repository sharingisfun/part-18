Each episode, except for 1x07, 2x05, and 2x10, are in high quality and probably the best you are going to be able to get out there.   I chose the .wmv format because it was the easiest for me and what I was wanting to do.  If you do not want the .wmv format, you can download the freeware program &quot;MediaCoder&quot; and change it to an .avi if you like.  \n\nAs I explained above, there are a few exceptions.\n\n1x07- The video is in low quality.  There wasn't anything I could do about this.\n\n1x12- I didn't have an English audio for this episode, so the whole thing is in Polish.  I provided English Subtitles on the episode though, so you can still enjoy it (hopefully).\n\n2x05 &amp;2x10- Both aren't in as great quality, but should still be acceptable.\n\n\n\nOriginally, I only had the high-quality Polish dubbed video's.  I took the English audio from another torrent (No offense to the uploader, but the quality was bad) and mixed it in with the Polish video, and got what you see here.  It wasn't that hard, but it did take a while.  Hopefully everyone appreciates it.\n\n\n\nAs a warning, my internet connection is a bit slow.  Unfortunately, many people who downloaded it didn't stick around, so I doubt there will be many seeders.  If you like what you download, please stick around if you don't mind.  \n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e9c6f624464d3758e4527ca6aeb3a3344c1488c","amp;dn":"Quick+Draw+McGraw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e9c6f624464d3758e4527ca6aeb3a3344c1488c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,156,111,98,68,100,211,117,142,69,39,202,106,235,58,51,68,193,72,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
