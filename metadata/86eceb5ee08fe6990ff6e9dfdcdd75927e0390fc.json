A move on from the sound of 2007's Star In The Hood, &quot;Catch 22&quot; sees Tinchy working with a diverse range of producers (from. Fraser T Smith to Frank Musik) and guest vocalists (from Taio Cruz to Amelle) to create a signature sound that is not only fresh and current, but is also uniquely his.\n\nLyrically the album focuses on Tinchy's day-to-day tales from his hood in bow, and his ever changing life as a rising star in the music industry. Spanning the shiny and radio friendly `Number 1' and `Never Leave Me' through to the gritty and bassline heavy, `Stryderman' and `Spotlight', &quot;Catch 22&quot; seamlessly balances universal appeal with street credibility.\n\nTracks:\n\n101  Take Off\n102  I'm Landing\n103  Take Me Back [Ft.
