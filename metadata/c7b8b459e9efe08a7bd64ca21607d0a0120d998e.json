This week we broke a half a million customers. So a mighty big pimp high five goes out to all the fans who have supported us from the beginning, the new fans weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve picked up along the way and our newly converted fans whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen our bright campfire light! And letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not forget the rest of the Pimps for kicking some serious early access development ass. Tip of the Fedora goes out to Robert, Joe, Chris, Brian, Joey, Ryan, Joel, Bryan, Alex, Jan and Will. You guys rock! And a belated Pimp of the week goes out to Robert for spearheading our Alpha 9 random gen. So drop us some feedback and tell your friends and letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keep this party rolling folks cause weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not going to stop until we deliver the best damn zombie survival game out there!\n\nWe also just updated the dedicated server only build (appid 294420). It uses the same version number (A9.2 b14) to be compatible with the existing clients. The update was due to a change in Unity 4.5.3 that obviously handles the VBlank different then in previous version. This caused a dedi server to take full CPU time of a single core even if no user was connected. This problem should be fixed with the latest update (steam buildid 373581)\n\nSo without further ado or Pimp rambling here are the official Alpha 9.2 release notes.\nOfficial Alpha 9.2 Release Notes\n\nAdded\n\n    Added new early version of Easy Anti-Cheat system that is a server option. If server has anti-cheat Vac enabled you cannot connect to it with a modified DLL. If you want to use your modified DLL as a client the server must have anti-cheat disabled. Modified DLLs on servers are possible with anti-cheats on. If you want to join anti-cheat enabled servers you will need to use stock DLLs only as a client. Hopefully no more TNT fists of fury!\n    Added Biome Zombie Spawning masks. Clear an area of zombies and that area will not spawn zombies again for about 5 days. This gives the player time to build a fort. It is not a free pass from wandering hordes or noise triggered hordes. It also forces the player to travel to hunt as you clean an area from animals.\n    Added new zombie pathing system. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just an early start to a grander scheme but zombies donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t weave back and forth as much and path straighter, they will only walk off a ledge from a certain height and can get through doors easily now. We still need to improve staircase and long distance pathing and they will occasionally spin but not as often.\n    Added feral night hordes. Once per week or every 7th night zombies get really hungry and become feral. These feral night hordes can sense players and will find them regardless of how well they are hiding. Every week the horde grows in numbers until the 7th week.\n    Added new grasslands biome formerly the plains with 4 new grasses, new sky spectrum, ground texture and tree and changed plains decorations to look more like Arizona and less like kansas\n    Added a new large hotel never before seen to the random gen spawn list. You can find it in desert, plains, forest and pine forest biomes along roads\n    Added new large hotel to Navezgane Desert\n    Added sham sandwich\n    Added new 9mm Pistol\n    Added new random gen map thumbnail and description\n    Added coffee farming\n    Added english.txt entry for Sham Sandwich\n    Added sparse corn plants to the plains\n    Added hwy_overpass_sign prefab\n    Added billboard trussing\n    Added recipe to make books from paper\n    Add weights to various metal objects so they can be melted down or they drop scrap iron when destroyed\n\nChanged\n\n    Changed the walk speed of one walk type, the cripple looking walk with the long stride.

This was causing some of them not to show up in Random Gen\n    Fixed army camps xmls so wilderness was spelled correctly causing them to not show up in random gen\n    Fixed housetanpyrmid2 name removing space causing it to not show in random gen\n    Fixed problem that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“snap to terrainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ changes have not been transferred to a connected server\n    Fixed static spawner y offset being incorrect so prefabs with ground or basement were not spawning zombies in random gen\n    Fixed It is no longer possible to contract dysentery when you have advanced dysentery\n    Fixed can burn trunk tips and wood pillars\n    Fixed Stability of roof in Barn_03 prefab\n    Fixed shortened english.txt longer recipe names to fit and got rid of Camel Cased words\n    Fixed Gave coolers terrain decoration flag\n\nServerConfig.xml\n\n    EAC will be on if the serverconfig.xml file has VACEnabled set to True like the line below\n    &lt;property name=Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½VACEnabledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ value=Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½trueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½/&gt;  &lt;!Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Enables/Disables Valve Anti Cheat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ&gt;\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    32 bit Operating Systems can run out of memory sometimes.
