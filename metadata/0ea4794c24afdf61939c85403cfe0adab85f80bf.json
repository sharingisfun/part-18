Then this is the book for you! Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just starting out in JavaScript or whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready to move into DOM scripting, it gives you the skills you need. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how:\n\n#1: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2 books in 1: A JavaScript book and a DOM scripting book\nMost books cover JavaScript or DOM scripting. But to create user-responsive sites, you need to know both.\n\nSo the first half of this book is a course in JavaScript essentials. Then, the second half is a course in DOM scripting that gives you a clear understanding of how DOM scripting works, how JavaScript underlies it, and how to use it to build applications that run slide shows, use drop-down menus, rotate headlines, sort tables, provide animation, and more!\n\nThat means you can gain basic to expert skills in a single book.\n\n#2: It provides a fast start\nSection 1 is a crash course in JavaScript. In fact, by the end of chapter 3, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know how to code, test, and debug applications that include elementary DOM scripting. Then, the rest of the book builds on those skills to cover all the JavaScript and DOM scripting essentials.\n\n#3: It shows you how to create and use event-handling libraries for browser compatibility\nOne of the headaches of web programming is ensuring that the code will work with all the popular browsers.\n\nSo this book shows you how to create your own event-handling libraries of browser-compatible code, so you can draw on it as needed. It shows you how to take advantage of free, third-party libraries like jQuery and Dojo. And it helps you to appreciate, and profit from, the extensive libraries of tested code that are included in the downloadable applications for the book.\n\n#4: It shows 20 complete applications that can be used as models for new apps\nThe key to mastering client-side web development is to have plenty of applications that show how the features interact and what problems might occur in building a website.\n\nSo this book gives you complete code for 20 professional applications. These run the gamut from business applications, like object-oriented forms validation, to entertainment apps, like a rotating, 3-dimensional carousel of images that the user can control with the mouse or keystrokes.\n\nYou can download these for free from the Murach website. Experiment with them on your own, then use them as time-saving models for new applications.\n\n#5: The paired-pages format lets developers set their own pace\nMurach books have a distinctive format. Each two-page spread presents a single topic: the lefthand page explains the topic, while the righthand page shows the critical details, using syntax, code, screen shots, and how-to notes.\n\nBoth beginning and experienced developers tell us that this format makes it easy to focus on the information they need, whether theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using the book for training or reference. Again, you can try this out for yourself by downloading chapters 2 and 3 for free from the Murach website.\n\nSo donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to become an expert web developer.
