The Osmonds are devout Mormons, and their religious values have influenced their careers.\n\nThe group originally consisted of brothers Alan Osmond, Wayne Osmond, Merrill Osmond, and Jay Osmond. They were later joined by younger siblings Donny Osmond, Marie Osmond, and Jimmy Osmond.\n\nOlder brothers George Virl Osmond, Jr. (Virl) and Tom Osmond were born deaf and did not originally perform,[2] although they later made occasional appearances, most notably on the family Christmas specials from the 70s.\n\nAll of the Osmonds were born in their hometown of Ogden, Utah except Jimmy, who was born in Canoga Park, California.\n\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d8058f2543faa0c8237dc5f49a2e36c86320d07","amp;dn":"The+Osmonds+-+Crazy+Horses+%5BTOTP+1972%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d8058f2543faa0c8237dc5f49a2e36c86320d07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,128,88,242,84,63,170,12,130,55,220,95,73,162,227,108,134,50,13,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
