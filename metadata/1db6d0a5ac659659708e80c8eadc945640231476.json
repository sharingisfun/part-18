AndriÃ„â€¡ wrote the novel while living quietly in Belgrade during World War II, publishing it in 1945. AndriÃ„â€¡ was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his entire literary work (of which this novel is best known) in 1961.\n\nThe Bridge on the Drina revolves around the town of ViÃ…Â¡egrad and the Mehmed PaÃ…Â¡a SokoloviÃ„â€¡ Bridge over the Drina river. The story spans about four centuries during the Ottoman and subsequently Austro-Hungarian administrations of the region and describes the lives, destinies and relations of the local inhabitants, with a particular focus on Muslims and Orthodox Christians living in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“From everything that man erects and builds in his urge for living, nothing is in my eyes better and more valuable than bridges,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ AndriÃ„â€¡ wrote. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They are more important than houses, more sacred than shrines. Belonging to everyone and being equal to everyone, useful, always built with a sense, on the spot where most human needs cross, they are more durable than other buildings and they do not serve for anything secret or bad.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n'The Bridge on the Drina' shows us, quite without judgment, how in &quot;that strange human game which is called war&quot; monstrous acts are committed and ordinary people are swept along Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but that afterwards, for those who survive, life goes on. Andric's own career, which included serving as a diplomat, was chequered by the incursions of history.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* The Bridge on the Drina - Ivo AndriÃ„â€¡, Translated from the Serbo-Croat by Lovett F.
