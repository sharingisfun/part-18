V. Amel'kin\n\nThis book is an easy-reading introduction to ordinary differential equations and their use in the study of real phenomena and processes. Problems taken from various fields of knowledge illustrate the tools used in setting up differential equations and the methods employed in their qualitative investigation. The book should be useful to  high-school students, teachers of science courses, college students, and specialists of, non-mathematical professions who use mathematics in their work.\n\nThe book discusses many interesting problems and has 2 chapters. The first one is dedicated to constructing the differential models and finding their solutions. The second chapter is more interesting, it shows you the way to deal with differential equations qualitatively.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by Eugene Yankovsky and was first published by Mir in 1990.\n\n\nPDF | 7.8 MB | OCR | Bookmarked | 600 dpi | Paginated | Cover | Pages: 284\n\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\n\nContents\n\nChapter 1.
