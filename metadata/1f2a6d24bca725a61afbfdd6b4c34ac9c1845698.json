His life reads like an adventure story complete with knock down fights, beautiful women and double-fisted excitement on every page. He has hunted jackalopes with Bobby Kennedy and Peter Lawford, had more than his share of his amorous exploits, and formed the greatest on-air team in the history of televised news. Along the way, he hobnobbed with people you wish you knew and some you honestly wish you didn't -- celebrities, presidents, presidents' wives, celebrities' wives, dogs, and, of course Veronica Corningstone, the love of his life. Walter Cronkite, Barbra Streisand, Katie Couric, the list goes on. Who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mr. Burgundy, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“RonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as he is known to his friends, rub elbows with in the course of his colorful and often criminal life?\nThis may well be the most thrilling book ever written, by a man of great physical, moral and spiritual strength and not surprisingly a great literary talent as well. This book deserves a real shot at a Pulitzer Prize. In fact if it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t win one then we will finally have proof that the Pulitzer is rigged.\nRon Burgundy has taken the time to write a book. We owe it to him, as honest Americans, to read it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f2a6d24bca725a61afbfdd6b4c34ac9c1845698","amp;dn":"Let+Me+Off+At+The+Top+%21+-+Ron+Burgundy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f2a6d24bca725a61afbfdd6b4c34ac9c1845698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,42,109,36,188,167,37,166,26,251,253,214,180,195,74,201,193,132,86,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
