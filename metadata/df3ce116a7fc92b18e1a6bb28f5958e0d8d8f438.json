Although he never quite became\na poll winner or a major influential force, Harrison has always been a solid\nimproviser. New York Cool moves his career up a notch and is one of his finest\nrecordings to date. Reuniting in 2005 with bassist Ron Carter and drummer Billy\nCobham (the trio had recorded Heroes for the Nagel Heyer label in 2002),\nHarrison and his sidemen constantly challenge each other, with each of the\nmusicians feeling free to set the direction of the performances. The repertoire\nis comprised of &quot;Body and Soul,&quot; &quot;Harrisburg Address&quot; (based on &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;),\n&quot;Easy Living,&quot; &quot;I'll Remember April,&quot; &quot;Star Eyes,&quot; Ron Carter's &quot;Third Plane&quot;\n(which deserves to become a standard), and the medium-tempo &quot;Blues for Happy\nPeople.&quot; The musicians feed off each other's ideas and their interplay is full\nof subtle surprises and unpredictable moments. New York Cool demonstrates that\nthere is plenty of life still to be found in bebop standards when they are\nplayed in creative fashion. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3ce116a7fc92b18e1a6bb28f5958e0d8d8f438","amp;dn":"Donald+Harrison%2C+Ron+Carter%2C+Billy+Cobham+-+New+York+Cool+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3ce116a7fc92b18e1a6bb28f5958e0d8d8f438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,60,225,22,167,252,146,177,142,26,107,178,143,89,88,224,216,216,244,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
