Learn basic level-design techniques using the Unity 3D game engine, and create environments that are fun to navigate, easy to reuse, and highly interactive. Author Adam Crespi shows you how to create a plan for a level based on goals you have set for the player, design a kit of parts and prototypes, and swap out white box objects with the finalized artwork. Then you'll learn how to add further realism with custom mesh colliders, ambient lighting, and animated objects like spinning fans and blinking lights. The end result? A fully designed level ready for characters and scripting.\n\nNote: This course places a strong emphasis on modular construction techniques and resource optimization as part of the design process, which will help your build process be more lean, nimble, and efficient. A basic knowledge of Autodesk 3ds Max or Maya, and Adobe Photoshop is recommended.\nTopics include:\n\n    Setting goals for the player\n    Planning the player path\n    Bounding the world invisibly\n    Defining player scale and field of view\n    Using and joining modular elements\n    Setting up prefabs\n    Adding ambient animation\n    Opening doors\n    Making stairs walkable\n    Lighting scenes\n\nSubjects:\n    3D + Animation Animation Materials Game Design Lighting Game Development \nSoftware:\n    Unity 3D \nAuthor:\n    Adam Crespi \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27502f66146f5a823757c14e36ee0da7db4b2fac","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Level+Design+Basics+in+Unity+-+Transcript+Included","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27502f66146f5a823757c14e36ee0da7db4b2fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,80,47,102,20,111,90,130,55,87,193,78,54,238,13,167,219,75,47,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
