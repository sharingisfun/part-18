It wiped out one-third of Europe's population, takingmillion lives. And yet, most of what we know about it is wrong. The details of the Plague etched in the minds of terrified schoolchildren -- the hideous black welts, the high fever, and the awful end by respiratory failure -- are more or less accurate. But what the Plague really was and how it made history remain shrouded in a haze of myths.\n\nNow, Norman Cantor, the premier historian of the Middle Ages, draws together the most recent scientific discoveries and groundbreaking historical research to pierce the mist and tell the story of the Black Death as a gripping, intimate narrative.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28e222b4c7b7f2470e45d220bcf8bba9aa0d4587","amp;dn":"In+the+Wake+of+the+Plague%3A+The+Black+Death+and+the+World+It+Made","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28e222b4c7b7f2470e45d220bcf8bba9aa0d4587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,226,34,180,199,183,242,71,14,69,210,32,188,248,187,169,170,13,69,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
