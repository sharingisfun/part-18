The book, 1982 pages in length, provides updated information on topics from engineering fundamentals to plant operations and also address the pertinent engineering subjects of patents and intellectual property, effective communication and ethics.  Diverse leaders in their respective fields have contributed to the book.\n\nAlbright stresses that his book is a handbook, not a text book.  &quot;It's a condensed text that is intended to get the reader started on a subject and to then provide references for further information&quot;, Albright states.  The handbook will serve the needs of chemical engineering students, practicing chemical engineers and management.  Professor Albright hopes that his handbook will be useful to chemical and other engineers and will bring honor to Purdue University. \n\nThank you Professor Albright!  We look forward to owning and using your handbook.&quot;\n\nYes we will. :)\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:810fcb961c633c6477277683664061e48788c7e0","amp;dn":"Albright%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s+Chemical+Engineering+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"810fcb961c633c6477277683664061e48788c7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,15,203,150,28,99,60,100,119,39,118,131,102,64,97,228,135,136,199,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
