The Pacific EP demo contains two previews of \nOn Marlin Isle, so...no I don't have the full song.\n\nThanks for downloading! I hope you enjoy this collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c07ff35b4dea8624221b721efd1d68c4fea57e1","amp;dn":"Port+Blue+-+Discography+%28AAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c07ff35b4dea8624221b721efd1d68c4fea57e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,7,255,53,180,222,168,98,66,33,183,33,239,209,214,140,79,234,87,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
