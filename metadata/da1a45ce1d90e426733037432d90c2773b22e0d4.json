She sees it as an opportunity to meet new people and live new adventure. During the trip she will meet the following people: A couple of thieves of international renown, an impoverished marquis and his undercover woman. A disinherited adventurer, and two undercover police agents. Bored and lonely, the beautiful woman accepts the courtmanship of three men she meets on the train: First, an American businessman, then a Hapsburgic officer, and lastly a Spanish bullfighter. In the end we find out that these three are none other than the lady's husband whom, cleverly disguised, has impersonated the three men in order to play an erotic game with the intent of awakening the passion between his wife and himself.\n\nPick another one:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/feeldabyte/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/feeldabyte/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1a45ce1d90e426733037432d90c2773b22e0d4","amp;dn":"Luca+Damiano+-+Adventures+on+the+Orient+Express+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1a45ce1d90e426733037432d90c2773b22e0d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,26,69,206,29,144,228,38,115,48,55,67,45,144,194,119,59,34,224,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
