Admin sends a newsletter or email saying &quot;We're very sorry to announce that our Liberty Reserve or Perfect Money account or admin panel .... has been hacked or something else &quot;! So what do you think? Is it the truth or an excuse to close down the hyip?\nWell first of all, I'm a Hyip Hacker Researcher and I have been online for 5 years experience in online hyip hacking. I have been online hacking for 5 years and now I want to share all those knowledge with anyone who wish to become a specialist hyip hacker and retrieve or steal all money from your scam hyip admin.\nHacking a website or e-Currency account is not that easy that many people would think since they have high security protection from hacker to break in.\nBut hacking in Hyip Admin's Panel Account is not that hard if you know how to do it since most hyip's script security protections is lower than the others.\nNot all hyips can be hackable but more than 50% of all hyips can be hacked using my Manual Hacking method!\nHacking in Hyip is NOT a crime since most of Hyip investment is a Ponzi Scheme.\nAs you can see I'm still Hacking in Hyip using my very own Hacking method which about to reveal to you.\nSecond of all, Forget all about hyip hacking software. Because it's pointless. Using these so-called hacking software to hack in an hyip is totally impossible and will never work. Plus your computer will be infected by a virus or spyware.\nIn order to hack in an hyip to steal admin's information like API Detail is to Manually Hack using my method. Once you have success hack in, you can do whatever you want with admin's panel account.\nYou can simply withdraw all your admin's money to your e-Currency account using their API Detail since most hyip admin store their API info in their admin's panel account for easy or automate payment when investor request payout.\nI'm sure you guys probably heard about Liberty Reserve API hack. This is what hacker does to steal money from other account. API is for transfer funds without login to your account. As long as you have their API name and Security Words you can transfer or steal all the money from the admin's account without login in.\n\nTitle: The Hyip Hacker's Underground Handbook\nAuthor: David Meinichuk\nPublisher: Learn-How-To-Hack.net\nYear of publication: 2013\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\n-nelly- home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!\n\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor re-seed requests, help, support or anything else relating to The Pirate Bay.
