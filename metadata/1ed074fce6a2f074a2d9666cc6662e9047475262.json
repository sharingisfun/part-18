The show goer, who hopefully ended up alright, walked out on his own two feet sandwiched between paramedics. This ordeal lasted a total of 10 minutes, and Segall didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop playing for a second. Maybe he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care, but whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more likely is Segall was too focussed to notice what was happening in the back of the room.\n\nFrom the moment he took the stage, Segall and his band were locked in. Songs such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thank God For Sinners,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“GirlfriendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re The DoctorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rushed by at paces that seemed even quicker than their recorded versions. There was no on-stage banter, no wasted time in-between tracks, no extended intros or outros.\n\nSegall, a San Francisco native, simply played his brand of loud and fast garage rock; a sound that Colorado crowds have grown familiar with over the course of the last year. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s released two albums and played Colorado at least three times in the last six months. But from witnessing the expressions on the faces of TuesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crowd, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear Segall hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exhausted the love this state has for him.\n\nHis songs may rarely reach past the four minute mark, but Segall packs as much as he can into his economical arrangements. Brief guitar solos, harmonies and long phrasing are staples of any good Segall tune, and they came through clearly on Tuesday night. The Hi-DiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound was spot-on for the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tight play. Drums, guitars and bass were balanced evenly. Most important, however, was that SegallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice could be heard above the screaming instrumentals that supported it.\n\nEnjoy and Share please\n\nwearethelastbeatniks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ed074fce6a2f074a2d9666cc6662e9047475262","amp;dn":"Ty+Segall+-+Hi+Dive+2013+raw%281080p_H.264-AAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ed074fce6a2f074a2d9666cc6662e9047475262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,208,116,252,230,162,240,116,162,217,102,108,198,102,46,144,71,71,82,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
