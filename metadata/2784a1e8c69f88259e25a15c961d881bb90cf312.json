If they weren't failing outright, causing countless Americans to lose their jobs and homes, they were being propped up with emergency bailouts. Trapped in a cycle of panics, depressions and soaring unemployment, Sutton saw only one way out, only one way to win the girl of his dreams.\n\nSo began the career of America's most successful bank robber. Over three decades Sutton became so good at breaking into banks, and such a master at breaking out of prisons, police called him one of the most dangerous men in New York, and the FBI put him on its first-ever Most Wanted List.\n\nBut the public rooted for Sutton. He never fired a shot, after all, and his victims were merely those bloodsucking banks. When he was finally caught for good in 1952, crowds surrounded the jail and chanted his name.\n\nBlending vast research with vivid imagination, Pulitzer Prize winner J.R. Moehringer brings Willie Sutton blazing back to life. In Moehringer's retelling, it was more than poverty or rage at society that drove Sutton. It was one unforgettable woman. In all Sutton's crimes and confinements, his first love (and first accomplice) was never far from his thoughts. And when Sutton finally walked free - a surprise pardon on Christmas Eve, 1969 - he immediately set out to find her.\n\nPoignant, comic, fast-paced and fact-studded, Sutton tells a story of economic pain that feels eerily modern, while unfolding a story of doomed love that is forever timeless.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2784a1e8c69f88259e25a15c961d881bb90cf312","amp;dn":"Sutton+by+J.R.+Moehringer+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29+%5BReq%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2784a1e8c69f88259e25a15c961d881bb90cf312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,132,161,232,198,159,136,37,158,37,161,92,150,29,136,27,185,12,243,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
