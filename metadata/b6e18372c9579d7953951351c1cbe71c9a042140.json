Brothers Bruce and Charlie Robison are as seasoned of players and songwriters as you will find anywhere in Texas country, and their sister Robyn Ludwick is also an accomplished songwriter and performer. Bruce Robison has penned multiple #1 songs, is married to singer/songwriter Kelly Willis, and the duo recently released an album together called CheaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Game that was nominated for the Americana Music AssociationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Album of the Year.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Charlie Robison was once married to Emily Robison Ã¢â‚¬â€ a founding member of the Dixie Chicks and Courtyard Hounds. The couple had 3 children before divorcing in 2008, but Emily continues to use the Robison name and the two remain best friends. Altogether, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a bad little list of music kudos for team Robison.\nOlder brother Charlie Robison may have never had the big #1 hits that younger brother Bruce did, but they tabulate those types of things far away in Nashville and New York City, and by the time that news trickles down to Texas it seems so trivial to the laid back, easy-feeling mood of the Lone Star State. Being just a year shy of 50, Charlie isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking to make a big splash, set records, or sniff the top of the charts, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simply releasing music that he wants to listen to and play, and for the rest of us that get the fortune of peering into his little party, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite entertaining to follow along.\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be spooked too much by the Haight-Ashbury circa 1967 album cover on this record. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no acid trips or space jams inside, though in its own way the cover conveys the laid back mood that the music of High Life embodies, and the harkening back to the cowboy hippie vibe of Austin in the mid 70Ã¢â‚¬Â²s that this album evokes. What you do get with High Life is some damn fine Texas country, and interestingly, 9 songs that Charlie Robison didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write. Normally it is Charlie doing the writing for himself and others, but CharlieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision to leave the pressure behind of penning new material is what allows the party-like, laid-back Saturday night feel of this album to flourish.\nCharlie didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to reach very far for the material for High Life. With songs by brother Bruce and sister Robyn, and songs from Texas songwriters like Doug Sahm and Kinky Friedman, High Life fits very nicely within the vibe of what Robison music is all about. Two songs from The BandÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Look Out ClevelandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Dylan-penned Ã¢â‚¬Å“When I Paint My MasterpieceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€even seem to slide right into the song selection fairly seamlessly.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6e18372c9579d7953951351c1cbe71c9a042140","amp;dn":"Charlie+Robison+-+High+Life+%282013%29+MP3VBR+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6e18372c9579d7953951351c1cbe71c9a042140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,225,131,114,201,87,157,121,83,149,19,81,193,203,231,28,154,4,33,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
