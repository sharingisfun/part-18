Until very recently, copyright bickering kept it from public circulation, and even now only &quot;libraries and educational institutions&quot; may purchase a copy.  To many, the social implications of these 14 films have always seemed a more likely reason for it being buried rather than shared, *not* merely copyright disputes.  Therefore I cannot think of a more wonderful application of torrent technology than this; to take something socially valuable which was once scarce and restricted and make it abundant and free-flowing.\n\n\n\nSeed with that in mind.\n\n\n\nPost here with any questions, comments or concerns","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd829066474be369d252ebcc27f8d06106f444c","amp;dn":"Eyes+on+the+Prize","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd829066474be369d252ebcc27f8d06106f444c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,216,41,6,100,116,190,54,157,37,46,188,194,127,141,6,16,111,68,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
