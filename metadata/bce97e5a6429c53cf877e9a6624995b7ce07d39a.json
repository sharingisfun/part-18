Thorn Tree In The Garden (02:53)\n\nThe southern United States have their own culture, mythology and traditions. It is manifestly a different place than the rest of the continental USA. Murry is completely immersed in the Southern aesthetic (even William Faulkner himself makes a posthumous guest appearance), the ghost of Mark Linkous haunts the songs and the Mississippi flows through them.\nWhen you get so entrenched in the mythology you lose sight of reference points and it can become difficult for an audience not steeped in the same tradition to follow. Ã¢â‚¬ËœLittle Coloured BalloonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ makes the same error as Josh PearsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last record; it asks us to follow it blindly for nine minutes without offering a reward for doing so.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2013/02/07/john-murry/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2013/02/07/john-murry/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce97e5a6429c53cf877e9a6624995b7ce07d39a","amp;dn":"John+Murry+-+The+Graceless+Age+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bce97e5a6429c53cf877e9a6624995b7ce07d39a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,233,126,90,100,41,197,60,248,119,233,166,98,73,149,183,206,7,211,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
