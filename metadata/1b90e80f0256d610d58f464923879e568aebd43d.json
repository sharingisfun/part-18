Using the basic technique of Fair Isle knitting (small geometric motifs worked with just two colors repeated in a row), she creates an earthy, modern, and timeless collection of designs divided into chapters entitled Water, Air, Fire, and Earth.\n\nUsing unconventional placement of Fair Isle patterning, such as at the cuff or shoulder, and asymmetrical or striped color placement, Ellis creates a wide variety of moods, movements, and graphic impact. And Inspired Fair Isle Knits isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just about Fair Isle knitting; it combines the basic method with other knitting techniques such as cables, lace patterning, felting, and even pleats.\n\nThe result is intricate-looking pieces that require only intermediate skills. Inspired Fair Isle Knits will also challenge experienced knitters with surprising takes on the Fair Isle patterned sweater, including a halter top, a tank, and a wrap.\n\nFor lovers of traditional patterns with contemporary flair, for intermediate knitters looking to expand their techniques and skills, and for anyone seeking lush and colorful new patterns, this is the ideal addition to any collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b90e80f0256d610d58f464923879e568aebd43d","amp;dn":"Inspired+Fair+Isle+Knits+-+20+Creative+Designs+Inspired+by+the+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b90e80f0256d610d58f464923879e568aebd43d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,144,232,15,2,86,214,16,213,143,70,73,35,135,158,86,138,235,212,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
