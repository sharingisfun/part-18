The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve. The Unconsecrated will never relent. And you must always mind the fence that surrounds the village; the fence that protects the village from the Forest of Hands and Teeth. But, slowly, MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s truths are failing her. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learning things she never wanted to know about the Sisterhood and its secrets, and the Guardians and their power, and about the Unconsecrated and their relentlessness. When the fence is breached and her world is thrown into chaos, she must choose between her village and her futureÃ¢â‚¬â€between the one she loves and the one who loves her. And she must face the truth about the Forest of Hands and Teeth. Could there be life outside a world surrounded in so much death?\n\nSeries: Forest of Hands and Teeth\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Listening Library (Audio); Unabridged edition (March 9, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307710319\nISBN-13: 978-0307710314\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Dead-Tossed Waves (Forest of Hands and Teeth) By Carrie Ryan  (Author) , Tara Sands (Reader)\n__\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aG5ukYgaL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aG5ukYgaL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout:\n__\n\nGabry lives a quiet life. As safe a life as is possible in a town trapped between a forest and the ocean, in a world teeming with the dead, who constantly hunger for those still living. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content on her side of the Barrier, happy to let her friends dream of the Dark City up the coast while she watches from the top of her lighthouse. But there are threats the Barrier cannot hold back. Threats like the secrets GabryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother thought she left behind when she escaped from the Sisterhood and the Forest of Hands and Teeth. Like the cult of religious zealots who worship the dead. Like the stranger from the forest who seems to know Gabry. And suddenly, everything is changing. One reckless moment, and half of GabryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s generation is dead, the other half imprisoned. Now Gabry only knows one thing: she must face the forest of her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past in order to save herself and the one she loves.\n\nSeries: Forest of Hands and Teeth\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Listening Library (Audio); Unabridged edition (March 9, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307710300\nISBN-13: 978-0307710307\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Dark and Hollow Places (Forest of Hands and Teeth) By Carrie Ryan, Allyson Ryan (Reader)\n___\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518QOeKGgyL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518QOeKGgyL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere are many things that Annah would like to forget: the look on her sister's face before Annah left her behind in the Forest of Hands and Teeth, her first glimpse of the Horde as they swarmed the Dark City, the sear of the barbed wire that would scar her for life. But most of all, Annah would like to forget the morning Elias left her for the Recruiters.  \nAnnah's world stopped that day, and she's been waiting for Elias to come home ever since. Somehow, without him, her life doesn't feel much different than the dead that roam the wasted city around her. Until she meets Catcher, and everything feels alive again. \nBut Catcher has his own secrets. Dark, terrifying truths that link him to a past Annah has longed to forget, and to a future too deadly to consider. And now it's up to Annah: can she continue to live in a world covered in the blood of the living? Or is death the only escape from the Return's destruction?\n\nSeries: Forest of Hands and Teeth\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Listening Library (Audio); Unabridged edition (March 22, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307747247\nISBN-13: 978-0307747242\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
