Jeff Wayne returned to conduct the 48-piece ULLAdubULLA Strings and 10-piece Black Smoke Band. \n\nA &quot;virtual&quot; Richard Burton (a projected image of a young Burton with a super-imposed actor's mouth and jaw lip synched to the original Burton recordings) performed as The Journalist. \n\nJustin Hayward reprised his original role as The Sung Thoughts of The Journalist and Chris Thompson returned as The Voice Of Humanity. Also from the original recording were Chris Spedding playing lead guitar and Herbie Flowers on bass guitar. \n\nOther guest artists who appeared were the &quot;People's Tenor&quot; Russell Watson as Parson Nathaniel, Alexis James as The Artilleryman, and Tara Blaise as Beth. \n\nDaniel Boys (known from BBC's Any Dream Will Do) was understudy for all the roles sung by male artists. A model Fighting Machine featured on stage. Also presented was a short animated 'prequel' to the story in the style of the upcoming feature-length film detailing the Martians' ecological destruction of their own world (which was originally made for the 1998 computer game Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds) and their preparations to invade Earth, and including a short remix of &quot;The Red Weed&quot;. The show was produced by Ray Jones Damian Collier and Jeff Wayne\n\nCast: Richard Burton (hologram)\nJustin Hayward\nAlexis James\nAnna Marie Wayne\nChris Thompson\nRussel Wilson\nTara Blaise\n\nFormat                         : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                 : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID                       : mp42\nFile size                      : 1.87 GiB\nDuration                       : 1h 50mn\nOverall bit rate mode          : Variable\nOverall bit rate               : 2 433 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                             : 1\nFormat                         : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                 : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP          : No\nFormat settings, QPel          : No\nFormat settings, GMC           : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix        : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                       : 20\nDuration                       : 1h 50mn\nBit rate                       : 2 301 Kbps\nWidth                          : 1 024 pixels\nHeight                         : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                : Constant\nFrame rate                     : 25.000 fps\nColor space                    : YUV\nChroma subsampling             : 4:2:0\nBit depth                      : 8 bits\nScan type                      : Progressive\nCompression mode               : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)             : 0.156\nStream size                    : 1.77 GiB (95%)\nWriting library                : Lavc51.40.4\n\nAudio\nID                             : 2\nFormat                         : AAC\nFormat/Info                    : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                 : LC\nCodec ID                       : 40\nDuration                       : 1h 50mn\nBit rate mode                  : Variable\nBit rate                       : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                     : 2 channels\nChannel positions              : Front: L R\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode               : Lossy\nStream size                    : 101 MiB (5%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99265f6773a8fb4a94c045e2e58d3e480baf79f9","amp;dn":"War+of+the+Worlds+-+The+Concert+2006+DvdRip+Mp4+DahippyDude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99265f6773a8fb4a94c045e2e58d3e480baf79f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,38,95,103,115,168,251,74,148,192,69,226,229,141,62,72,11,175,121,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
