One of Turkey's most prominent novelists,  his work has sold over eleven million books in sixty languages, making him the country's best-selling writer.\n\nBorn in Istanbul, Pamuk is Robert Yik-Fong Tam Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, where he teaches comparative literature and writing. His novels include The White Castle, The Black Book, The New Life, My Name Is Red and Snow.\n\nAs well as the Nobel Prize in Literature (the first Nobel Prize to be awarded to a Turkish citizen), Pamuk is the recipient of numerous other literary awards. My Name Is Red won the 2002 Prix du Meilleur Livre Ãƒâ€°tranger, 2002 Premio Grinzane Cavour and 2003 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.\n\nThe European Writers' Parliament came about as a result of a joint proposal by Pamuk and JosÃƒÂ© Saramago. In 2005, Pamuk was put on trial in Turkey after he made a statement regarding the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire. His intention, according to Pamuk himself, had been to highlight issues relating to freedom of speech (or lack thereof) in the country of his birth. The ensuing controversy featured the burning of Pamuk's books at rallies. He has also been the target of assassination attempts.\n\n\nThe torrent contains:\n\nEssays and Lecture\n\n* My Father's Suitcase -- PDF \n\n* Other Colors -- ePUB + PDF \n\n* The Naive and The Sentimental Novelist -- ePUB + PDF\n\n\n\nMemoir\n\n* Istanbul - Memories of a City -- ePUB + PDF\n\n\n\nNovels\n\n* Museum of Innocence -- ePUB + PDF\n\n* My Name is Red -- ePUB + PDF \n\n* Silent House -- ePUB + PDF\n\n* Snow -- ePUB + PDF\n\n* White Castle -- ePUB + PDF\n\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, check out the websites, watch the videos, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give feedback!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5587/the-art-of-fiction-no-187-orhan-pamuk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5587/the-art-of-fiction-no-187-orhan-pamuk&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2006/pamuk-interview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2006/pamuk-interview.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newrepublic.com/article/113948/orhan-pamuk-interview-taksim-square-erdogan-literature&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newrepublic.com/article/113948/orhan-pamuk-interview-taksim-square-erdogan-literature&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/orhan-pamuk-by-the-book.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/orhan-pamuk-by-the-book.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/6866832/Orhan-Pamuk-interview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/6866832/Orhan-Pamuk-interview.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan_Pamuk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan_Pamuk&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.orhanpamuk.net/interviews.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.orhanpamuk.net/interviews.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/books/interview-orhan-pamuk-i-was-not-a-political-person.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/books/interview-orhan-pamuk-i-was-not-a-political-person.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40ecce579114497a7ff1368ce12ca0289fae5799","amp;dn":"Orhan+Pamuk-+Novels%2C+Essays%2C+Lectures+and+Memoir+%289+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40ecce579114497a7ff1368ce12ca0289fae5799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,236,206,87,145,20,73,122,127,241,54,140,225,44,160,40,159,174,87,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
