Himmelblau (Prentice-Hall)\n\nISBN 9780132346603\n\nThe Number One Guide to Chemical Engineering Principles, Techniques, Calculations, and Applications: Now Even More Current, Efficient, and Practical\n\nBasic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering, Eighth Edition goes far beyond traditional introductory chemical engineering topics, presenting applications that reflect the full scope of contemporary chemical, petroleum, and environmental engineering. Celebrating its fiftieth Anniversary as the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading practical introduction, it has been extensively updated and reorganized to cover todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s principles and calculations more efficiently, and to present far more coverage of bioengineering, nanoengineering, and green engineering.\n\nOffering a strong foundation of skills and knowledge for successful study and practice, it guides students through formulating and solving material and energy balance problems, as well as describing gases, liquids, and vapors. Throughout, the authors introduce efficient, consistent, student-friendly methods for solving problems, analyzing data, and gaining a conceptual, application-based understanding of modern chemical engineering processes. This editionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s improvements include many new problems, examples, and homework assignments.\n\nCoverage includes\nModular chapters designed to support introductory chemical engineering courses of any length\nThorough introductions to unit conversions, basis selection, and process measurements\nConsistent, sound strategies for solving material and energy balance problems\nClear introductions to key concepts ranging from stoichiometry to enthalpy\nBehavior of gases, liquids, and solids: ideal/real gases, single component two-phase systems, gas-liquid systems, and more\nSelf-assessment questions to help readers identify areas they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fully understand\nThought/discussion and homework problems in every chapter\nNew biotech and bioengineering problems throughout\nNew examples and homework on nanotechnology, environmental engineering, and green engineering\nExtensive tables, charts, and glossaries in each chapte\nMany new student projects\nReference appendices presenting atomic weights and numbers, Pitzer Z factors, heats of formation and combustion, and more\n\nPractical, readable, and exceptionally easy to use, Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering, Eighth Edition, is the definitive chemical engineering introduction for students, license candidates, practicing engineers, and scientists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52097e4d121253868eb9f69ce4ec795c58da355c","amp;dn":"Basic+Principles+and+Calculations+in+Chemical+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52097e4d121253868eb9f69ce4ec795c58da355c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,9,126,77,18,18,83,134,142,185,246,156,228,236,121,92,88,218,53,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
