In this training we'll do just that as we create a little creature from scratch. \n\nWe'll cover methods of working with polygon geometry using several of Blender's modeling tools. We'll learn to shape and sculpt our mesh using a multi-resolution workflow. We'll add high-frequency detail using noise patterns and learn to assign some simple materials to our objects. To finish, we'll add a couple of lights and create a quick render. \n\nThis step-by-step training is designed to be a quick look at Blender and allow to get the feel of working on a small project, without bogging down in the details of the interface or blasting you with every workflow possibility. Once you're done, you can decide if it appeals to you and which areas you might be more interested in.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf5a37d0ddb30b4f06d424d9139209ea59b10265","amp;dn":"Your+First+Day+in+Blender+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf5a37d0ddb30b4f06d424d9139209ea59b10265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,90,55,208,221,179,11,79,6,212,36,217,19,146,9,234,89,177,2,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
