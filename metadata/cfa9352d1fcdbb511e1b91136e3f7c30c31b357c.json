The albums &quot;Traditional Music of Herat&quot; and &quot;Female Musicians of Herat&quot; offer a variety of vocal and instrumental music from the Herat region with traditional instruments such as dutÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢r, chahÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢rtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢r, sornÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢r and dohol, dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ira, nai chapÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ni and robÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢b. These recordings were made just before the start of the civil war, which disrupted the life of this ancient centre of Islamic culture. Recorded in 1973 - 1977 Text by John Baily\n\n320 kbps; including full booklet scans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfa9352d1fcdbb511e1b91136e3f7c30c31b357c","amp;dn":"Afghanistan.+Female+Musicians+in+Herat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfa9352d1fcdbb511e1b91136e3f7c30c31b357c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,169,53,45,31,205,187,81,30,27,145,19,110,63,124,48,195,27,53,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
