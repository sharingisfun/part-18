As far as Lt. Aldo Raine (aka Aldo the Apache,&quot; Brad Pitt) -- is concerned, the only good Nazi is a dead Nazi. Raine's mission is to strike fear into the heart of Adolf Hitler by brutally murdering as many goose-steppers as possible, or die trying. In order to accomplish that goal, Lt. Raine recruits a ruthless team of cold-blooded killers known as &quot;The Basterds&quot; which includes baseball-bat-wielding Bostonian Sgt. Donnie Donowitz (aka &quot;The Bear Jew,&quot; Eli Roth) and steely psychopath Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), among others. When the Basterds' secret rendezvous with turncoat German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) goes awry, they learn that the Nazis will be staging the French premiere of &quot;The Nation's Pride,&quot; a rousing propaganda film based on the exploits of German hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hl), at a modest theater owned by Jewish cinephile Shoshanna Dreyfus (MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lanie Laurent), posing as a Gentile after the brutal murder of her family by the ruthless Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). As the Basterds hatch an explosive plan to take out as many Nazis as possible at the premiere, they remain completely oblivious to the fact that Shoshanna, too, longs to bring the Third Reich to its knees, and that she's willing to sacrifice her beloved theater in the process. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Inglourious.Basterds.2009.720p.BDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format profile : OpenDML\n      File size : 4.30 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 32mn\n      Overall bit rate : 4 027 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 32mn\n      Bit rate : 3 569 Kbps\n      Width : 1 280 pixels\n      Height : 544 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.214\n      Stream size : 3.81 GiB (89%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 2h 32mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 490 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNo hardsubs; Arabic, Brazilian, Czech, Danish, Dutch,  English (for foreign parts), French,  Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58a4f011736cb7d33972d9b937f268024138befd","amp;dn":"Inglourious.Basterds.2009.720p.BDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58a4f011736cb7d33972d9b937f268024138befd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,164,240,17,115,108,183,211,57,114,217,185,55,242,104,2,65,56,190,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
