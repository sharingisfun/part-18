It retains its detail while removing most of the spots, some of the scratches and most of the excessive noise that had made its way from the old film to the DVD.\nAs imperfections are removed, so is a lot of (undesirable) data, which explains -along with good x264 encoding- how you can obtain such good quality at such a low bitrate.\n\nMany Bergman movies should follow, chronlogically tough not each one needs a new encode.\n\n&quot;Bergman's neorealist, Gothenburg-set drama is the story of BeritÃ¢â‚¬â€œan emotionally vulnerable young woman recently out of a reformatory and with an abusive motherÃ¢â‚¬â€œwho is seen first attempting suicide by diving off the docks, then protesting furiously when she is rescued. A chance of happiness seems to present itself when she meets a dock worker at a dance, but first she must reconcile him to her troubled past and vicious-tongued mother. Bergman makes excellent use of his gritty, sea-front locations and doesn't shirk from showing the drudgery and misery his protagonists endure in their day-to-day lives.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Geoffrey Macnab, Sight and Sound\n\nSubtitles :\nDanish\nEnglish\nFrench\nNorwegian\nPortuguese\nSpanish\nSwedish\nTurkish\n\nFormat                           : Matroska\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;054d6c626d4549312b34&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 3:2\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AAC\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e54a9bca37fc0cadb989f710e063dd93eddbab7","amp;dn":"Hamnstad-1948-Bergman-DVDRip-x264-OPTIZED.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e54a9bca37fc0cadb989f710e063dd93eddbab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,84,169,188,163,127,192,202,219,152,159,113,14,6,61,217,62,221,186,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
