After all, for a guy who broke into an Imperial cell block and helped destroy the Death Star, the assignment sounds simple enough.\n\nBut when Han locates the brash rebel agent, Scarlet Hark, she's determined to stay behind enemy lines. A pirate plans to sell a cache of stolen secrets that the Empire would destroy entire worlds to protectÃ¢â‚¬â€including the planet where Leia is currently meeting with rebel sympathizers. Scarlet wants to track down the thief and steal the bounty herself, and Han has no choice but to go along if he's to keep everyone involved from getting themselves killed. From teeming city streets to a lethal jungle to a trap-filled alien temple, Han, Chewbacca, Leia, and their daring new comrade confront one ambush, double cross, and firestorm after another as they try to keep crucial intel out of Imperial hands.\n\nBut even with the crack support of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing squadron, the Alliance heroes may be hopelessly outgunned in their final battle for the highest of stakes: the power to liberate the galaxy from tyranny or ensure the EmpireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign of darkness forever. \n\n\nStar Wars: Honor Among Thieves, is a novel written by Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck under the pseudonym James S.
