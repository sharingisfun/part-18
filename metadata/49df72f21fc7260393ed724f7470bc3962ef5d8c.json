It is quite long, but worth the time to see this masterpiece, and appropriate for all ages. Its basically the good guy vs the bad guy and the heroine theme but the roles are mixed up in a wonderful way to where each main character is both at different times. I love Maggie DuBois(Natalie Wood) the most because she is such a strong intelligent woman, and yet beautiful and sexy. She would do anything to stay in the race, and did. Professor Fate and Max are not Laural and Hardy but evoke their comedy team spirit strongly. They are the ones that make the bumbling mistakes that make them more human than the perfect Leslie(Tony Curtis). The prince is a silly compliment to Professor Fate, both brilliantly played by Jack Lemmon. Also worth seeing is Vivian Vance as the wife of the newspaper owner, and Larry Storch as the gunfighter. I really liked the submarine, rocket sled, pedaled air balloon, and the vintage cars. Visually, this movie is a work of art, and the music is perfect. The score features Henry Mancini's &quot;The Sweetheart Tree.&quot; Yes, there's lust, love and romance here too. This is the quintessential epic comedy of the 60's. \n\nRip Specs (HD TV)\n\nGeneral           : The.Great.Race.1965.720p.HDTV.AVC.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 5 983 Kbps\nLength            : 6.12 GiB for 2h 26mn 23s 300ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 5 600 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 532 (2.406) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059243/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059243/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49df72f21fc7260393ed724f7470bc3962ef5d8c","amp;dn":"The.Great.Race.1965.720p.HDTV.AVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49df72f21fc7260393ed724f7470bc3962ef5d8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,223,114,242,31,199,38,3,147,237,114,79,116,112,188,57,98,239,93,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
