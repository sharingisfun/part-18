She makes sure anyone who comes near the pond leaves thirsty, or doesn't leave at all.\n\nConfident in her own abilities, Lynn has no use for the world beyond the nearby fields and forest. Having a life means dedicating it to survival, and the constant work of gathering wood and water. Having a pond requires the fortitude to protect it, something Mother taught her well during their quiet hours on the rooftop, rifles in hand.\n\nBut wisps of smoke on the horizon mean one thing: strangers. The mysterious footprints by the pond, nighttime threats, and gunshots make it all too clear Lynn has exactly what they want, and they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop until they get itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nWith evocative, spare language and incredible drama, danger, and romance, debut author Mindy McGinnis depicts one girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey in a barren world not so different than our own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:588bf3efc49eefc0289e0107a5a89a8945eaef86","amp;dn":"Not+a+Drop+to+Drink+-+Mindy+McGinnis.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"588bf3efc49eefc0289e0107a5a89a8945eaef86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,139,243,239,196,158,239,192,40,158,1,7,165,168,154,137,69,234,239,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
