The Bible Continues\nAbout the Show\n\nFrom executive producers Roma Downey (&quot;The Bible&quot;) and Mark Burnett (&quot;The Bible,&quot; &quot;The Voice&quot;) comes an uplifting spiritual journey through the later chapters of biblical history. &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues&quot; picks up where the smash hit miniseries &quot;The Bible&quot; left off, continuing the greatest story ever told and exploring the exciting and inspiring events that followed the Crucifixion of Christ.\n\nThe immediate aftermath of Christ's death had a massive impact on his disciples, his mother, Mary, and key political and religious leaders of the era, completely altering the entire world in an instant. Beginning at that fateful moment of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues&quot; will focus on the disciples who had to go forward and spread the teachings of Christ to a world dominated by political unrest, and the start of a whole new religion that would dramatically reshape the history of the world.\n\nJesus (Juan Pablo Di Pace) dies on the cross at the hands of the Romans, deserted by even his most loyal followers. Peter (Adam Levy) and the disciples are hunted by Temple authorities led by High Priest Caiaphas (Richard Coyle) and Roman soldiers under orders from Governor Pontius Pilate (Vincent Regan). For the tiny band of followers, every day is a fight for survival, and their mission to spread the word to the world seems impossible.\n\nYet, they have hope and soon they have power: the amazing miracle of the Resurrection and the shocking arrival of the Holy Spirit upon them all at Pentecost enables them to inspire more and more people to join. The growing church brings challenges for Peter, John (Babou Alieu Ceesay) and Mary Magdalene (Chipo Chung), who are pushed to the limit; they face trials and imprisonments, persecutions and punishments while trying to understand the God-given power granted to them as they transition from the sorrow of Christ's ultimate sacrifice to the awe-inspiring wonder of the Resurrection and beyond.\n\nRichard Bedser serves as executive producer alongside Downey and Burnett. &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues&quot; is a production of LightWorkers Media.\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope. If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice, Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long. \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83e1608e7562b7fe0d6fcdd1d24009ae0b23e2e9","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+A.D.+The+Bible+Contiues+-+Episodes+1+thru+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83e1608e7562b7fe0d6fcdd1d24009ae0b23e2e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,225,96,142,117,98,183,254,13,111,205,209,210,64,9,174,11,35,226,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
