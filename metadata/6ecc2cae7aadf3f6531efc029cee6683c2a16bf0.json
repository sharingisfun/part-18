Two of the highlights, &quot;Living for the City&quot; and &quot;Too High,&quot; make an especially deep impression thanks to Stevie's narrative talents; on the first, an eight-minute mini-epic, he brings a hard-scrabble Mississippi black youth to the city and illustrates, via a brilliant dramatic interlude, what lies in wait for innocents. (He also uses his variety of voice impersonations to stunning effect.) &quot;Too High&quot; is just as stunning, a cautionary tale about drugs driven by a dizzying chorus of scat vocals and a springing bassline. &quot;Higher Ground,&quot; a funky follow-up to the previous album's big hit (&quot;Superstition&quot;), and &quot;Jesus Children of America&quot; both introduced Wonder's interest in Eastern religion. It's a tribute to his genius that he could broach topics like reincarnation and transcendental meditation in a pop context with minimal interference to the rest of the album. Wonder also made no secret of the fact that &quot;He's Misstra Know-It-All&quot; was directed at Tricky Dick, aka Richard Milhouse Nixon, then making headlines (and destroying America's faith in the highest office) with the biggest political scandal of the century. Putting all these differing themes and topics into perspective was the front cover, a striking piece by Efram Wolff portraying Stevie Wonder as the blind visionary, an artist seeing far better than those around him what was going on in the early '70s, and using his astonishing musical gifts to make this commentary one of the most effective and entertaining ever heard. \n\n.: Cover :.\n\n[img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mctycogeGz1ryd75mo1_cover.jpg[/img]\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nToo High\nVisions\nLiving for the City\nGolden Lady\nHigher Ground\nJesus Children of America\nAll In Love Is Fair\nDon't You Worry 'Bout a Thing\nHe's Misstra Know-it-all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ecc2cae7aadf3f6531efc029cee6683c2a16bf0","amp;dn":"Stevie+Wonder+-+Innervisions+%5BFlac%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ecc2cae7aadf3f6531efc029cee6683c2a16bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,204,44,174,122,173,243,246,83,30,252,2,156,238,102,131,194,161,107,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
