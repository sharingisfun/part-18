The sixteen essays, by authors who represent various academic disciplines, bring a spectrum of interpretive approaches to bear in order to aid the understanding of a wide-ranging audience, from first-time readers of the Republic who require guidance, to more experienced readers who wish to explore contemporary currents in the work's interpretation. The three initial chapters address aspects of the work as a whole. They are followed by essays that match closely the sequence in which topics are presented in the ten books of the Republic. Since the Republic returns frequently to the same topics by different routes, so do the authors of this volume, who provide the readers with divergent yet complementary perspectives by which to appreciate the Republic's principal concerns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5062b83f1362797a78af12f19ccf9130a8a7c7f6","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Companion+to+Plato%27s+Republic.pdf+%28nuneral%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5062b83f1362797a78af12f19ccf9130a8a7c7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,98,184,63,19,98,121,122,120,175,18,241,156,207,145,48,168,167,199,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
