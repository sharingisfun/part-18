Although, both were largely not well recieved then,like a lot of the music underdogs, they are certainly regarded as musical gods now. As Brian Eno said about the Velvet Underground's influence on those few who bought their records, went on to form bands,the same can be said about the Stooges and the MC5.This is a video and music montage of live shows, the hippie freaks,and scenes from the era,set to a blazing soundtrack provided by the 5. Following that,is a little one to one,with John,who sets the record straight,on the myths and legends, and  his involvement with the band.
