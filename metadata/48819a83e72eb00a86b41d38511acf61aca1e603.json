Burn Iso in CD with any burner\n2. then reboot your system\n3. then press any key\n4. format and Install it \n5. Windows is pre activated so no need to activate it\n6. AND INJOY \n=======================================================================\nInstalling From USB\n\nQuotes denote the command to type, do not type the actual &quot;s\nLaunch the DiskPart utility by typing &quot;diskpart&quot; at the Start Menu.\n&quot;list disk&quot; //command to find the drive with appropriate size.\n&quot;select disk 1&quot; //where the &quot;1&quot; is actually the corresponding number of your USB drive.\nMake sure you choose the correct flash drive if you have more than one of the same size.\n&quot;clean&quot; // removes all partitions\n&quot;create partition primary&quot; //bootable partition\n&quot;active&quot;\n&quot;format fs=ntfs quick&quot; //can use fat32 if all files on drive are something like 3gb or smaller.\nYou should not need a boot sector on a usb drive. Most motherboards allow booting to usb drives.\n&quot;assign&quot; // command gives the USB drive a drive letter, making it easy to access from Windows Explorer\n\nYou are done with diskpart, type &quot;exit&quot; //dont need quotes\n\nThen you can copy everything from the Windows 8 installation DVD onto the USB key (a simple drag and drop will do).\nI would not reccommend extracting directly from iso to flash drive. It will take forever, and burn up your drive.\nInstead, extract to hard drive first, then copy or cut/paste to the drive. Make sure you do not put the files in a subdirectory or \nthe drive will not boot.\n\nwhen installing from USB boot and enter bios setup (usually del key on bootup)\nFind where it lists the hard disk boot order. (usually some kind of boot section)\nSelect hard disks and put the usb drive at the top of the queue with the c drive you install to just below it.\nSave and exit bios (usually f10)\n\nThe installation will now proceed as usual?but faster.\nYou can remove the usb flash drive after the first setup reboot, it won't use it anymore.\n====================================================================\n\n\nInfo:\n\nPlatform: Windows 8 x64\nCompilation Date: 09.05.2013\nBased on Edition: Pro\nAutomated Installation : Yes\nCategory : Operating System\nActivation Needed :No\nKernel Type: Hybrid\nInstallation Type: BIOS\nDigitally Signed for Security : Yes\nUEFI Support: Enabled\nDVD-Key : Not Required\nSize: 6.0 GB\nNo of DVD's: 1 (Dual Layer)\nFormat: ISO Image File\nInstallation Time : 30 - 45 Mins\nAuthor: Nishant \n\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n1 GB RAM (Recommended 2GB RAM)\n20 GB of HDD space\n128 MB of Graphics Memory (Capable to run Windows Aero)\n17inch Monitor (1024 x 768)\nDVD-ROM or DVD-RAM\nPixel Shader 2.0\nDual Core Processors\n\nNOTE: START A FRESH INSTALLATION FROM BIOS AND INSTALL IN A SEPARATE PARTITION. \nDON'T UPGRADE YOUR PREVIOUS WINDOWS WITH THIS VERSION OF WINDOWS. \nDON'T TRY TO INSTALL THIS EDITION IN NON-SUPPORTIVE MOTHERBOARDS.\n\n\nFeatures,overview and updates of Windows? 8 Evolution?
