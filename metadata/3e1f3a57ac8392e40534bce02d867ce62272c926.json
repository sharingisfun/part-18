Her mother, a prostitute, died when he was a baby, and he was raised in the bordello where she worked. He also doesn't know who his father is. Believing he rules his own destiny, he refuses to compromise with anyone else, the corrupt policemen always chasing him, the oppressive discipline in the juvenile institution Febem, or the drug dealers who try to lure him. But this independence has a price.\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Quero.2007.720p.HDTV.x264-jsCRF.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 793 Kbps\nLength            : 4.37 GiB for 1h 20mn 21s 632ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 7 598 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 30.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945383/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945383/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPortuguese audio; no subs\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e1f3a57ac8392e40534bce02d867ce62272c926","amp;dn":"Quero.2007.720p.HDTV.x264-jsCRF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e1f3a57ac8392e40534bce02d867ce62272c926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,31,58,87,172,131,146,228,5,52,188,224,45,134,124,230,34,114,201,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
