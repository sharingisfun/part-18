She dates guys but finds no satisfaction in their company, and is rejected by female friends who she does desire. She dreams of something more. She meets Emma who is a free spirited girl whom AdÃƒÂ¨le's friends reject due to her sexuality, and by association most begin to reject AdÃƒÂ¨le. Her relationship with Emma grows into more than just friends as she is the only person with whom she can express herself openly. Together, AdÃƒÂ¨le and Emma explore social acceptance, sexuality, and the emotional spectrum of their maturing relationship.\n\n Director: Abdellatif Kechiche \n Writers: Abdellatif Kechiche (scenario, adaptation and dialogue), Ghalia Lacroix (scenario, adaptation and dialogue), 1 more credit Ã‚Â» \n Stars: LÃƒÂ©a Seydoux, AdÃƒÂ¨le Exarchopoulos, Salim Kechiouche","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89d32ee785423f884c1074e59a7dfff71d23806e","amp;dn":"Blue.Is.the.Warmest.Color.2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89d32ee785423f884c1074e59a7dfff71d23806e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,211,46,231,133,66,63,136,76,16,116,229,154,125,255,247,29,35,128,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
