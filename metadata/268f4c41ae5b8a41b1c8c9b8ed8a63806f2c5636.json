There's no spectators but the music impresses, is at its full swing. Moreover, you are under the impression that the members of the band surpass themselves musically and they give the best they can. Adrian Maben succeeds skilfully the marriage between the sound and the picture and it creates an entrancing climate. I think about the static shots of different places in Pompei with &quot;Echoes&quot; (probable the best song Pink Floyd has ever written) in the background. However, his making appears to be paradoxical: it can be both creative and ingenious: Waters' scream in &quot;careful with that axe Eugene is compared with a volcano erupting. On the other hand, it's a pity that he favours a bit too often slow travelings and the same precise shots of the band's members during their performance. It can give birth to weariness. Nevertheless, &quot;Pink Floyd: live at Pompei&quot; is also a well-regulated movie thanks to the sequences that take place in the Abbey Road Studios. You see interviews of the band and this one at work, recording their masterpiece &quot;dark side of the moon&quot;, THE album that will reveal them to the general public and probably their last collective album before Roger Waters' seizure of power. If you wish to know how your favourite album was recorded, the movie will deliver it to you... In short, &quot;Pink Floyd: live at Pompei&quot; will delight any Pink Floyd fan.\n\n After the debut of the hour-long version in 1972, Adrian Maben followed up on this already outstanding production two years later with an extended cut of the film. Featuring a one-off performance by the Pink Floyd in an ancient amphitheater in the city of Pompeii, playing such compositions as &quot;Echoes,&quot; &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot; and &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets,&quot; as well as interviews with the band members and footage of the group working on what is now considered one of music s most beloved albums, The Dark Side of the Moon. Haunting, breathtaking and innovative, there are many words to describe this overlooked gem. \n\n In 2011, a fan of the film, seeing that there was no proper presentation of the 1974 version on DVD, decided to assemble an amateur restoration from past releases of the film. And a year later, with the help of the online fan community, the legendary quadraphonic mix was acquired from a genuine 35mm print of the film (a relic which hasn't seen the light of day since the film's theatrical run in the mid 1970s). As a result, this project was later updated and posted on the internet. \n\n 1. &quot;Intro Song&quot;\n 2. &quot;Echoes, Part 1&quot; (from Meddle, 1971)\n 3. &quot;On the Run&quot; (studio footage) (from The Dark Side of the Moon, 1973)\n 4. &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot; (from Point Me At The Sky, B-side, 1968)\n 5. &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; (from A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968)\n 6. &quot;Us and Them&quot; (studio footage) (from The Dark Side of the Moon, 1973)\n 7. &quot;One of These Days&quot; (from Meddle, 1971)\n 8. &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; (from A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968)\n 9. &quot;Brain Damage&quot; (studio footage) (from The Dark Side of the Moon, 1973)\n 10. &quot;Mademoiselle Nobs&quot; (from Meddle, 1971)\n 11. &quot;Echoes, Part 2&quot; (from Meddle, 1971)\n\n\n\nSource Notes \n\n The audio was taken from a 35mm Cinemascope 4-track magnetic striped print of Live at Pompeii featuring the quadraphonic mix (L, R, Ls, Rs; &quot;4 corners&quot;). This format used the same 4 channel magnetic audio tracks but not in the intended standard L, C, R, S configuration. This &quot;4 corners&quot; quad format was briefly used in the early/mid 1970's for more music focused films. The only theaters equipped for the non-standard audio for- mat were in New York and Los Angeles. The video was taken from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Original Concert FilmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ featured on the DirectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cut DVD release, as well as the Vestron LaserDisc release. The DVD is of decent quality, as it displays some occasional compression artifacts (including macro-blocking and mos- quito noise). The LaserDisc, on the other hand, shows signs of laser rot in the form of the multi-colored specs that appear in the video. Color correction was applied to the LaserDisc footage to make it look as good as possible. \n\n\nHistorical Background \n\n In 1974, associate producer Phil Borack (whose company April Fools Films handled dis- tribution of the film in the United States) and director Adrian Maben visited Los Angeles for the purpose of finding someone to produce a quadraphonic mix for the film from the original multi-tracks. Dan Wallin, who received an Oscar nomination four years earlier for his work on Woodstock, was appointed for this task. The mix was done in discrete quad, the multi-tracks were mixed to mag at A&amp;M record studios, then the mags were taken over to Todd-AO where the final mix was done. The quad mix was featured in select screenings of the film, but has never seen the light of day since then. Pink Floyd was never involved with the quad mix, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re completely unaware of its existence. \n\n\nAudio Lineage \n\n 35mm Cinemascope 4-track magnetic striped print &gt; Custom-built playback machine &gt; Digidesign 192 I/O &gt; Pro Tools HD &gt; 24-bit/192kHz WAV &gt; Pro Tools HD &gt; Izotope SRC &gt; 24-bit/96kHz WAV &gt; SurCode MLP &gt; discWelder Chrome &gt; DVD Audio \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:268f4c41ae5b8a41b1c8c9b8ed8a63806f2c5636","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd%3A+Live+At+Pompeii+%5BDVD-Audio+24bit%2F96khz+Quad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"268f4c41ae5b8a41b1c8c9b8ed8a63806f2c5636","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,143,76,65,174,91,138,65,177,200,201,184,237,138,99,128,111,44,86,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
