Many of us are also teaching, even when it's not in our job descriptions. Whether it's giving a presentation, writing documentation, or creating a website or blog, we need and want to share our knowledge with other people. But if you've ever fallen asleep over a boring textbook, or fast-forwarded through a tedious e-learning exercise, you know that creating a great learning experience is harder than it seems.\nIn &quot;Design For How People Learn,&quot; you'll discover how to use the key principles behind learning, memory, and attention to create materials that enable your audience to both gain and retain the knowledge and skills you're sharing. Using accessible visual metaphors and concrete methods and examples, &quot;Design For How People Learn&quot; will teach you how to leverage the fundamental concepts of instructional design both to improve your own learning and to engage your audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e52e960471b38c6423270ec090f5c03f2ea0390","amp;dn":"Design+For+How+People+Learn+-+Julie+Dirksen.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e52e960471b38c6423270ec090f5c03f2ea0390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,82,233,96,71,27,56,198,66,50,112,236,9,15,92,3,242,234,3,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
