Soup is one of the staple foods in a Jesuit community, and there is almost always a pot simmering on the stove. In more than forty years as a Jesuit brother, Brother Curry has traveled the world, lived in many different communities, and prepared many, many pots of soup. This collection includes recipes for sixty of his most popular soups-everything from an exotic Roasted Red Pepper Soup to the classic Minestrone Milanese to a hearty Corn Chowder, from a relatively simple chicken soup to the more complex Mussels Soup Billy-bi. But Brother Curry writes about a great deal more than soup. He includes stories to savor about his life in the community of Jesuits: the people he's met; the meals he's enjoyed; and the daily practices of patience, reverence, humility, and care that go into making a good soup and a good life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6045930f508d699f73e7ae0e3ed5fce113cf69e6","amp;dn":"The+Secrets+of+Jesuit+Soupmaking+A+Year+of+Our+Soups+%28Compass%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6045930f508d699f73e7ae0e3ed5fce113cf69e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,69,147,15,80,141,105,159,115,231,174,14,62,213,252,225,19,207,105,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
