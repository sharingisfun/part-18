The story focuses of a happy young African couple; one day the husband is arrested for political reasons and interrogated in the dreaded Luanda prison. The central movement of the film is the search of the young wife from village to village for her lost husband, a journey that points up with heartbreaking clarity the contrast between promise and oppression in modern Africa. A work of art, as well as an important political document, that speaks both for its own land and the victims of political oppression everywhere.\n\nPLEASE SEED AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU DOWNLOAD SO THIS TORRENT WILL NEVER DIE!
