The Munn familyfather John (Mulroney) and his sons, Chris (Bell) and Tim (Devon Alan)lives a solitary life on a rural farm in Georgia. But when John\\\\\\&amp;#039;s brother Deel (Lucas) arrives, fresh from prison and with a sea of rage and envy simmering beneath his skin, the family\\\\\\&amp;#039;s isolated world becomes one marked by violence, greed and murder.\n\n\nThis is the 1994 movie.  It has no relation to the grunge music band of the same era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:489f88fd6fe9b386cb6c5aeff4cae969f72ae7fb","amp;dn":"Undertow.%5BEnglishOnly%5D%5B1994%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"489f88fd6fe9b386cb6c5aeff4cae969f72ae7fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,159,136,253,111,233,179,134,203,108,90,239,244,202,233,105,247,42,231,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
