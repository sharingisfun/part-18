Being married to US Marshal Sam Kage has changed him-it's settled the tumult of their past and changed Jory from a guy who bails at the first sign of trouble to a man who stays and weathers the storm. He and Sam have two kids, a house in the burbs, and a badass minivan. Jory's days of being an epicenter for disaster are over. Domestic life is good.\n\nWhich means it's exactly the right time for a shakeup on the home front. Sam's ex turns up in an unexpected place. A hit man climbs up their balcony at a family reunion. And maybe both of those things have something to do with a witness who disappeared a year ago. Marital bliss just got a kick in the pants, but Jory won't let anyone take his family away from him. Before he knew what it felt like to have a home, he would have run. Not anymore. He knows he and Sam need to handle things together, because that's the only way they're going to make it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7b5d94630633925c3300fcdc86b8b1dfb6f1a70","amp;dn":"Mary+Calmes+-+Matter+of+Time+Book+6+But+for+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7b5d94630633925c3300fcdc86b8b1dfb6f1a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,181,217,70,48,99,57,37,195,48,15,205,200,107,139,29,251,111,26,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
