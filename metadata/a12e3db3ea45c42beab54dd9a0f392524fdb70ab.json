Like several of PoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stories, and in keeping with the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative revolves around a person being buried alive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in this case, by immurement.\n\nSummary by wikipedia.org: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cask_of_Amontillado\n\n\nFor more free ebooks and Audiobooks visit http://www.opencast.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12e3db3ea45c42beab54dd9a0f392524fdb70ab","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+The+Cask+of+Amontillado+by+Edgar+Allan+Poe+%5Bwww.opencast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a12e3db3ea45c42beab54dd9a0f392524fdb70ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,46,61,179,234,69,196,43,234,181,77,217,160,243,146,82,79,219,112,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
