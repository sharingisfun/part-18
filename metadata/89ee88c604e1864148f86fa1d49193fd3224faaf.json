This series ran from July 2001 to June 2004.\n\nI will leave the commentary to the pundits and suffice it to say that this series contained some critically important story lines that echo into the current X-Men story lines.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89ee88c604e1864148f86fa1d49193fd3224faaf","amp;dn":"X-Treme+X-Men","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89ee88c604e1864148f86fa1d49193fd3224faaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,238,136,198,4,225,134,65,72,248,111,161,212,145,147,253,50,36,250,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
