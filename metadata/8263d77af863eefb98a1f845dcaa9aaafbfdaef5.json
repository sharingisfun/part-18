This handbook is loaded with information and helpful tips for disassembling old and broken electronics. Each of the more than 50 deconstruction projects includes a Ã¢â‚¬Å“treasures cacheÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the components to be found, a required tools list, and step-by-step instructions with photos on how to safely extract the working components. Projects include building a desk lamp from an old flatbed scanner, a barbeque supercharger from a Dustbuster impeller, and a robot from the gears, rollers, and stepper motor found in an ink-jet printer. Now, old VHS players and fax machines will find new life with these fun ideas.\n\n\nBy Ed Sobey\nPublished by Chicago Review Press in 2011\nPDF, Retail, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8263d77af863eefb98a1f845dcaa9aaafbfdaef5","amp;dn":"Unscrewed+%28PDF%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8263d77af863eefb98a1f845dcaa9aaafbfdaef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,99,215,122,248,99,238,251,152,161,248,69,220,170,154,170,251,253,174,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
