She fell into his arms (literally) at a karaoke bar, and a year later KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an insta-family, complete with three stepchildren and two ex-wives. Diane is ex-wife number one, an intense, over-achieving doctor and the mother of twin teenagers Hillary and Warren. Diane is quick to convey her withering disapproval of KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s barely tapped maternal instinct. Ex-wife number two, Jackie, is mother to adopted son Bert, and can pull PeteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strings with her special blend of neurotic, new-ageyness. Juggling all this baggage is uncharted territory for Kate, who finds support with her best friend Meg, a party-hearty singleton and the only woman Kate knows who has less experience with kids than she has.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6594b32c868b1f8351d9e45b6939dda094f233e8","amp;dn":"Trophy.Wife.S01E04.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6594b32c868b1f8351d9e45b6939dda094f233e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,148,179,44,134,139,31,131,81,217,228,91,105,57,221,160,148,242,51,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
