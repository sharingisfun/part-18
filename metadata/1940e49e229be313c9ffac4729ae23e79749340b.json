Assemble a solid foundation of drums with varied sets of fills, grooves, and groove variations. Thanks to the wide variety of drum sounds available, you can create human-sounding performances. Rhythm Section also provides dozens of playable instruments: ten strings, ten basses, and ten drum kits.\n\n\nObviously this is for the Mac only (I know some idiot is going to ask). Enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1940e49e229be313c9ffac4729ae23e79749340b","amp;dn":"Garageband+-+Jam+Pack%3A+Rhythm+Section+DVD+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1940e49e229be313c9ffac4729ae23e79749340b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,64,228,158,34,155,227,19,201,255,172,71,41,174,35,231,151,73,52,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
