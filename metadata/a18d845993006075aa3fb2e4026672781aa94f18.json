Part siren song, part grim warning, it achieves a perspective-warping balance between the haunting intimacy of HoopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivery and an unconfined air of horizon-scanning grandeur from the outset Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tempestuous, moodily melodic opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœBorn ToÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shares this striking duality with later highlights Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhen IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m AsleepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacemakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeeper DevastationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nIt arrives with more than a few splashes on its hands. Life and death; light and dark; sex and war; head and heart: The House That Jack Built offers up as much in celebration of the macabre as it does in mistrust of the familiar, with a twist of humour. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s steeped in an allusion to biology, nature and humanity, but drops precious few clues as to whether its next rush of imagery is set to beguile or repel.\n\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a18d845993006075aa3fb2e4026672781aa94f18","amp;dn":"Jesca+Hoop+-+The+House+That+Jack+Built+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a18d845993006075aa3fb2e4026672781aa94f18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,141,132,89,147,0,96,117,170,63,178,228,2,102,114,120,26,169,79,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
