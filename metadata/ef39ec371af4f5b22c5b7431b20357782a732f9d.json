It is Costello's fifth album, and fourth with the \nAttractions. It was also his fifth consecutive album produced by Nick Lowe, who handled production on all \nsongs except &quot;Big Sister's Clothes&quot; (which the liner notes make clear by stating that Lowe was &quot;not\n responsible&quot; for it)\nThe songs on the album dealt with a general sense of disenchantment he felt during the time, with the recent\n election of the Conservative government as well as tensions within his first marriage, which gave them an \noverall cynical tone.As a result, the general lyrical content of the songs describe a world that is \nessentially the opposite of what the album title implies.\n\n==================================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01 - Clubland.flac\n02 - Lovers Walk.flac\n03 - You'll Never Be a Man.flac\n04 - Pretty Words.flac\n05 - Strict Time.flac\n06 - Luxembourgh.flac\n07 - Watch Your Step.flac\n08 - New Lace Sleeves.flac\n09 - From a Whisper to a Scream.flac\n10 - Different Finger.flac\n11 - White Knuckles.flac\n12 - Shot with His Own Gun.flac\n13 - Fish 'n' Chip Paper.flac\n14 - Big Sister's Clothes.flac\n\n==================================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 846 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Trust\nTrack name/Total                         : 14 / 14\nPerformer                                : Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions\nGenre                                    : Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1981\nWriting application                      : X Lossless Decoder 20110703\nComment                                  : Warner-Pioneer ~ P-10965X Original Japanese Pressing\n\n==============================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 936 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef39ec371af4f5b22c5b7431b20357782a732f9d","amp;dn":"Elvis+Costello+%26amp%3B+The+Attractions+-+Trust+%281981%29FLAC+24+Bit+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef39ec371af4f5b22c5b7431b20357782a732f9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,57,236,55,26,244,245,178,44,91,116,49,178,3,87,120,42,115,47,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
