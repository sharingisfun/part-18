Known to his adoring public simply as 'Seve', Severiano Ballesteros took the world of golf by storm and transcended the sport, with his magnetic personality and sublime skill. Presented by Gary Lineker, this heart-warming tribute celebrates Seve's life and features exclusive footage of the man himself.\n\nHandsome, flamboyant and passionate, Seve strode the fairways for 30 years. He won the greatest honours in the game including three Open Championships and two Masters titles, often playing miraculous escape shots that held galleries in awe, from St Andrews to Augusta. He became a European talisman in the Ryder Cup, on the winning side four times as a player, and memorably, once as a captain on the Spanish course of Valderrama. Tragically at the age of just 54, Seve lost his painful battle with brain cancer earlier this year. His foundation had already raised millions for cancer charities, ensuring his legacy will live on.\n\nFeaturing contributions from Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Rafa Nadal, Jose Maria Olazabal, Sir Nick Faldo, Colin Montgomerie, Greg Norman, HRH Prince Andrew , Sir Bruce Forsyth, Des Lynam and Peter Alliss.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 726 MB\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\nSubtitles: merged\n\nSRT available at MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f1d19d0901379d20ea359a013892ffe6dfce67f","amp;dn":"BBC+Seve+The+Legend+576p+HDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f1d19d0901379d20ea359a013892ffe6dfce67f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,29,25,208,144,19,121,210,14,163,89,160,19,137,47,254,109,252,230,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
