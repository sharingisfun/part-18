The quartet moved to England in 1983\nand signed to ZTT Records, also the home of Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Art of Noise. Propaganda's first single,\n&quot;Dr. Mabuse,&quot; reached the British Top 30 in early 1984, but the band's second release was more than a year in coming.\nFinally, in May 1985,&quot;Duel&quot; trumped the debut single by hitting number 21.\n\n\nPropaganda's first album A Secret Wish appeared one month later, and the resulting tour necessitated the addition of\nbassist Derek Forbes and drummer Brian McGee -- both formerly with Simple Minds. After the release of the remix album\nWishful Thinking later that year, Dorper became the first original member to leave the band, and Propaganda splintered\nsoon after, due to a prolonged legal battle to leave ZTT.\n\n\nTrack List\n\n01.
