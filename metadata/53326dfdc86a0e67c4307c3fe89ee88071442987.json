The film was written by David J. Schow and John Shirley, and directed by Alex Proyas. The Crow stars Brandon Lee, in his final film, as Eric Draven, a rock musician who is revived from the dead to avenge his own murder, as well as that of his fiancee. While filming during the last weeks of production, Lee was mortally wounded when a dummy bullet, which had become lodged in one of the prop guns, was shot into his abdomen by a squib. Despite the incident, the film was a critical and commercial success after its release, opening at the top of the box office.\nThis is one of my favorite films of all time! I remember vividly being in high school, and someone bringing a newspaper into class with the news that Brandon Lee had been shot on set. I never thought he would die! I just thought he was too strong. I had seen Rapid Fire and LeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique fight chorography and of course Show Down In Little Tokyo was one of the coolest martial arts/action films ever. So the next day when the news was out that he died I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe it! Then all the buzz started, the studio announced they would finish THE CROW and make it a worthy tribute to Brandon. And that they certainly did! I went to see it seven times in the theater. While itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s terrible knowing you are watching this wonderfully, charismatic, beautiful, talented, screen presence thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no longer living guiding you through this amazing ride of love, violence and justifiable revenge, they did such an amazing job with the final piece of media that it will forever stand as a lasting tribute to Brandon Lee. And in that respect he still lives and will always. The greatest gothic film of all time! Along with one of the best rock, Goth, edged soundtracks of a film!\nThis is an all-time classic film to enjoy for DEVILS NIGHT &amp; HALLOWEEN! If you love the film, have not seen it in a while or maybe even have never seen it before, you will love all the rare extras included in this release. This is the ENTIRE (The Crow Collectors Series: The Crow (film) along with ALL the Bonus Material on the two DVDs) All these extras really are a wonderful tribute to the late, great Brandon Lee and pay homage to this brilliant, timeless film. Enjoy for DEVILS NIGHT &amp; HALLOWEEN! Go paint yourself up, light some fires and watch with someone special like Eric or Shelly! Please SEED! Cheers.\nSTORYLINE (IMBD): A poetic guitarist Eric Draven is brought back to life by a crow a year after he and his fiancee are murdered.

Disorder, chaos, anarchy: now thats fun!\nEric Draven: Cant rain all the time...\nEric Draven: Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \nGideon: What are you talking about? \nEric Draven: You heard me rapping, right? \nT-Bird: You know, Lake Erie actually caught on fire once from all the crap floating around in it. I wish I could've seen that. \nEric Draven: Theyre all dead. They just dont know it yet.\nSarah: [voiceover] People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right.\n\nFACTS:\n-Brandon Lee died during a mishap on the set. A scene required a gun to be loaded, cocked, and then pointed at the camera. Because of the close-range of the shot, the bullets loaded had real brass caps, but no powder. After the cut, the props master (not the arms master - he had left the set for the day) dry-fired the gun to get the cock off, knocking an empty cartridge into the barrel of the gun. The next scene to be filmed involving that gun was the rape of Shelly. The gun was loaded with blanks (which usually contain double or triple the powder of a normal bullet to make a loud noise). Lee entered the set carrying a bag of groceries containing an explosive blood pack. The script called for Funboy (Michael Massee) to shoot Eric Draven (Lee) as he entered the room, triggering the blood pack. The cartridge that was stuck in the barrel was blasted at Lee through the bag he was carrying, killing him. The footage of his death was destroyed without being developed.\n-Although he was not at fault for the death of Brandon Lee Michael Massee took a year off sabbatical from acting because he was so traumatized by the incident. He has never seen the film.\n-Director Alex Proyas originally wanted to shoot the entire movie in &quot;black and white&quot; closer to the comics and only using color in Dravens flash backs scenes with high contrast theme, but the studio executives didnt allow him to experiment with approach. This made Proyas shoot much of the movie in a monochromatic color theme mixed with red and dark gray.\n-T-Birds final words are from Book IV of Miltons Paradise Lost.\n-I remember in 1993 about a week after Brandon Lee died the newspapers were filled with stories about the irony of his untimely death. One report stated that in preparation for his role as Eric Draven, a supernatural force that comes back from the dead for revenge, Brandon Lee filled a bath tub full of ice cubes, and sat in it naked to try and experience what the true coldness of death was like. \n-Because the film was being shot over the legal hours of daily for shooting time, which lead to the carelessness of the gun not being checked properly that was responsible for a discharge fatally wounding Branding Lee, the long hours and stress of the shoot also caused Lee to take up smoking. You can see him smoking in the Behind-The-Scenes-Featurette. \n-The film grossed $50,693,129 in the United States, $94,000,000 worldwide. In the United States, it opened at number 1 with $11,774,332 in its opening weekend. According to Box Office Mojo, it ranked at 24 for all films released in the US in 1994 and 10 for R-rated films released that year\n\nPLEASE SEED!
