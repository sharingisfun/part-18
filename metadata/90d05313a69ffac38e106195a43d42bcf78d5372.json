His Italian immigrant father (Lee J. Cobb, whose mannered performance has been especially criticized) obviously wants the boy to follow his musical instincts, but the pull of the ring is too great ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ more so because through it he meets and falls for Barbara Stanwyck, actually his manager (Adolphe Menjou)'s fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e.
