With over 700 to choose from...These are just a few of what you get. Emulators are included for each game system, Just extract to a directory of choice, Pick the emulator that works best for you, set up your game pad and blast off. Note: I have not tested on Windows 7 but works fine on 95,98,2000,ME,XP,Vista So I would imagine it will work on Windows 7 as well. The files are self contained so they don't attach to the Windows system. Have Fun!!\n\nMega Man 1-6\nMario\nSonic\nDonkey Kong\nFaxanadu\nDouble Dragon\nDuck Tales\nGhouls and ghosts\nDigger\nBugs Bunny's birthday\nCastlevania\nmetroid\nMickey Mouse\nNinja Gaiden\nPac Man\nRobo Cop\nPitFall\nTailspin\nFrogger\nWolfen\nZelda\nAlex the Kid\nAfterburner\nChuck Rock\nDuke Nukem\nFatal Fury\nGhost Busters\nGolden Axe\nHome Alone\nKid Chameleon\nBomberman\nRoad Rash\nSimpsons\nSonic and Knuckles\nStreet fighter\nStreets of Rage\nTeenage Mutant Hero Turtles\nTerminator\nTiny Toon Adventures\nMortal Kombat\nToejam &amp; Earl\nX-Men\nZombies Ate My Neighbors\nBubble Bobble\nCalifornia Games\nBack to the Future\nAltered Beast\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade\nLion King\nLemmings\nJungle Book\nMs. Pac-man\nAlien Vs Predator\nBattletoads\nBeavis and Butthead\nBatman\nBubsy\nDoom\nDragon Ball Z\n\n\n\nNOTE: It has taken years to collect these and may not ever be found again, treat this like gold!\n\nAdditional Install Notes:\nUse Winzip or some other zip utility to extract all files to a new folder ie..c:\\Program Files\\Old Video Games  ...or something like that, of course you can name the new folder  \nanything you want, once this is done you'll notice all the files seperate into proper folders, no need to create a folder for each game system, I've already done that for you. Next setup each emulator for that system ie... I find that ( jnes_0_5_1 ) seems to work fine for me with the NES Roms, and ( zsneswv1.36 ) works fine for the SNES Roms, and so on, but you choose. Each Emulator is different and you have to set up your game pad for that system, the browse for the Rom location in the directory you created, do this with each emulator you choose and you're done, create a shortcut for each emulator and place on your desktop or where ever, double click on it, it will open and you'll see the Roms in a pane, just load the game you want to play.\n\nThis isn't hard at all to set up, it might seem more complicated reading it, but I started this collection in 1996 and knew nothing about it and I was playing in no time, to me these games never go out of style.\n\nHAVE FUN!! And don't forget to Seed!!! \n\nComments:&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;aad9c9c5d8dac3c5dfd9989d939deacbc5c684c9c5c7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nALL VIRUS FREE!!!
