The trio, who manage to walk the finest line between\ncomposition -- both highly and loosely structured -- and free improvisation,\nare at their level best here, walking a tightrope of tension where their\nnaturally lyrical improvisational style is juxtaposed against their innate\ndesire to push the envelope. Check out the opener, &quot;Naysayer,&quot; where Charles\nWaters' clarinet playing vacillates between a folk melody and an angular scalar\ninvestigation while remaining in the grip of the rhythm section's melodic\nbacking. Elsewhere, as on the title track, a propulsive bassline by Adam\nRoberts brings in an Ornette Coleman-esque melodic line, deceptively simple,\nthough its rhythmic construction is anything but, changing signatures after\nalmost every bar and adding improvisation sometimes in the chorus and at others\nin polyrhythmic bridges created by Andrew Barker's drumming -- he is anything\nbut a time keeper. The beautiful, edgy scalar structures that are at the heart\nof the mismatched angles in &quot;Williamsburg Concerto 1 &amp; 2&quot; offer a view of the\ntaut license at the heart of the group's compositions. Here intervals are\nintroduced and extrapolated upon in a thematic manner and discarded in favor of\ncomplete disintegration that gets reconstructed in the process of free blowing\n-- Waters' saxophone solo here is devastatingly phrased and executed, as the\nrhythm section forgets about keeping up; they do much more -- they provide a\nground upon which he can eventually land. The communication on this date is\nnearly astonishing and the rapport between the players is instinctual at this\npoint. If you cannot catch Goldsparkle live, this is easily the next best\nthing, and the most desirable of all of their recordings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc0451f4c4b3c48ccf0eec3e253a5dde8734564","amp;dn":"Gold+Sparkle+Trio+-+Thunder+Reminded+Me+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc0451f4c4b3c48ccf0eec3e253a5dde8734564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,192,69,31,76,75,60,72,204,240,238,195,226,83,165,221,232,115,69,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
