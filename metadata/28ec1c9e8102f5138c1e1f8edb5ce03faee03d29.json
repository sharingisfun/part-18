It overcomes some of the shortfalls of both processes. Hybrid laser-arc welding combines deep weld penetration of laser welding with good gap tolerance of gas metal arc welding (GMAW). HLAW can also enhance the metallurgical stability of a finished component, giving welds that are stronger and less brittle. This important book provides a comprehensive account of hybrid laser-arc welding including technological aspects, hybrid welding of metals, applications and future trends.\n\nKey Features: reviews arc and laser welding including both advantages and disadvantages of the hybrid laser-arc approach; explores the characteristics of the process including the properties of joints produced by hybrid laser-arc welding and ways of assessing weld quality; examines applications of the process including magnesium alloys, aluminium and steel with specific focus on applications in the shipbuilding and automotive industries.\n\nContents: Part 1 Characteristics of hybrid laser-arc welding: Advantages and disadvantages of arc and laser welding; Fundamentals of hybrid laser-arc welding; Heat sources of hybrid laser-arc welding processes; Effect of shielding gas on hybrid laser-arc welding; Properties of joints produced by hybrid laser-arc welding; Quality control and assessing weld quality in hybrid laser-arc welding. Part 2 Applications of hybrid laser-arc welding: Hybrid welding of magnesium alloys; Shipbuilding applications of hybrid laser-arc welding; Industrial robotic application of laser-GMAW and laser-Tandem hybrid welding; Hybrid laser-arc welding of aluminium; Hybrid laser-arc welding of dissimilar metals. Part 3 Hybrid laser-arc welding of steel: Hybrid laser-arc welding of steel.\nAbout the Author\nProfessor Flemming Ove Olsen works in the Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Management at the Technical University of Denmark. He is internationally known for his research in the field of hybrid laser-arc welding. \n\n\n# Hardcover: 336 pages\n# Publisher: Woodhead Publishing Ltd (26 Jun 2009)\n# Language English\n# ISBN-10: 1845693701\n# ISBN-13: 978-1845693701","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ec1c9e8102f5138c1e1f8edb5ce03faee03d29","amp;dn":"Hybrid+Laser+Arc+Welding+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ec1c9e8102f5138c1e1f8edb5ce03faee03d29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,236,28,158,129,2,245,19,140,30,31,142,219,92,224,63,174,224,61,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
