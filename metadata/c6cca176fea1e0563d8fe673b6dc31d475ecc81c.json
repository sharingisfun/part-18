However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than anticipated with Trench's forces not stopping the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves.\n\n\nfor best viewing use VLC PLAYER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6cca176fea1e0563d8fe673b6dc31d475ecc81c","amp;dn":"2.Guns.2013.BRRip.XviD.AC3-REAPER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6cca176fea1e0563d8fe673b6dc31d475ecc81c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,204,161,118,254,161,224,86,61,143,230,115,182,220,49,212,117,236,200,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
