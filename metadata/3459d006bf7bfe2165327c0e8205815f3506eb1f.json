Contained are .msi installations that are pre-fixed with the license placed during installation. The license is included in the zip but you can find it after the install in the install directory in the license folders of each of the installed programs. I have experienced it open without intervention but may have been cuz it was installed before. If it asks, the license is in the license folder located in the install directory of the .msi you installed (each of them has the same license in it) . Either way, the license is also contained in the zip if you cannot locate it. \n\n\n                Si9000e PCB Transmission Line Field Solver\n\nNEW: Version 11.04 and above supports roughness for both drum and treated side copper\n\nThe Si9000e PCB controlled impedance frequency-dependent boundary element field solver combines powerful impedance calculation over a wide range of structures and unprecedented ease of use:\n\n    Links with Speedstack as Speedstack Si\n\n    Inbuilt impedance graphing\n\n    Graphs conductor, dielectric and insertion loss\n\n    At-a-glance comprehensive S-parameter charting ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ magnitude, phase and smith charts\n\n    Single-ended and Mixed-mode S-parameters charting and data tables\n\n    User defined S-parameter source and termination impedance\n\n    Frequency dependent modeling down to 1KHz\n\n    Go/no go via stub check.\n\nWith its fast, accurate, frequency-dependent transmission line modeling, the new Si9000e is designed to model transmission line loss, impedance at given frequencies and extract full transmission line parameters over a wide range of popular PCB transmission lines (over 90 structures). Employing boundary element method field solving, the Si9000e extracts RLGC matrices and rapidly plots a range of transmission line information for the structure you are designing. Loss is graphed three ways with clear indication of dielectric, copper and total loss.\n\n \n\n\nSi9000 graphs all losses - conductor, dielectric and insertion loss. The Si9000 caters for both single and multiple dielectric builds, along with the ability to take into account solder mask performance. Mask coverage can be set adjacent, between and above traces. Many Polar customers request frequency-dependent impedance modelling, with particular reference to transmission line losses - the result is the Si9000e. The Si9000e is built on the same proven boundary element field solving platform as the PCB fabrication industry standard Si8000m. Increasing numbers of engineers are using the Si8000m as a rapid and accurate design tool for transmission line impedance - the Si9000e extends the output to extract full transmission line parameters. \n\n\n                    Si8000m Controlled Impedance Field Solver:\n\n                  (Si8000m links with Speedstack as Speedstack PCB)\n\nWhat's New in the Si8000m?\n\nNew Crosshatch return path modelling\nInbuilt sensitivity graphing\nCoarse and fine Impedance Goal seeking\nModel multiple dielectric PCBs\n36 Single ended coplanar structures\n36 Differential coplanar structures\nLink to PCB stackup Speedstack\n\n\nPowerful impedance design system\nImpedance Goal seeking\nModel multiple dielectric PCBs\nReduce time to market\nGraph production variations\nSingle ended and differential\nCalculate the effect of resin rich areas\nEnhanced soldermask models\n10 x Single ended structures\n17 x Differential structures\n\nTheSi8000m is an all new boundary element method field solver that builds on the familiar easy to use user interface in earlier Polar impedance design systems. The Si8000m adds enhanced modelling to predict the finished impedance of multiple dielectric PCB builds and also takes into account  the local variations in dielectric constant on close spaced differential structures.\n\nSurface coating is often overlooked when modelling and the Si8000m models the resist thickness adjacent to above and between surface traces. This offers a much more elegant solution which can be tailored to the particular resist application method in use on your boards. The new Si8000m also extracts even and common mode impedance. (Even mode impedance is defined as the characteristic impedance of one side of a transmission line pair when both lines are driven by a signal of equal magnitude and polarity). It is becoming increasingly necessary to control these characteristics on  high speed systems such as USB2.0 and LVDS.\n\nField solving Impedance design system\n\nThe Field Solvers in the Si8000m allow you accurately to graph impedance against various PCB parameters. The Si8000m Controlled Impedance Design System is a comprehensive controlled impedance design aid which can run stand alone as a Quicksolver, or the underlying engine can be applied directly though the optional Microsoft Excel user interface.\n\nThe Si8000m allows you to produce impedance controlled boards with maximum yields. You can also use the Si8000 to reduce the number of prototype iterations before production ramp up.\n\nHow? You have 2 powerful methods of using the field solvers.\n\nOne: A quick solving calculator lets you seek a target impedance by varying any one parameter, it could be line width, stack height or Er; you choose the variable and set the goal seek ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ you can even set realistic targets for your own production limits. Use the Edit / Copy to Excel to take values from the Quick solver and paste directly into the Si8000m Excel spreadsheet\n\nTwo: With the Si Excel option, a package of MicrosoftÃ¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â« Excel spreadsheets allows direct access to the field solvers; you can graph any parameter you choose using the pre-prepared Microsoft Excel workbooks or build your own workbooks to model your process.\n\nWith the ever increasing speeds of modern circuitry the demand for high quality controlled impedance printed circuit boards is continuing to grow. Today's PCBs are not just simple electrical interconnection devices, they are complex highly specified components in their own right. As the demand for controlled impedance PCBs has risen there has been a subsequent increase in requirement to verify these board designs prior to manufacture.\n\nDifferential Impedance PCB Structures\nSingle Ended Impedance Modeling\nMicrostrip and Stripline Constructions\nAll new field solvers employ Boundary Element Method BEM\nModel soldermask thickness between and adjacent to tracks\nWindows 2000 Windows XP Operation\n\nThe Si8000m field solving impedance design system  offers advanced field solving methods to model most circuit designs and is totally complementary to the CITS500s and RITS520a manual and automatic Controlled Impedance Test Systems. CITS measurement systems have been in use with leading PCB manufactures throughout the world since 1991 and Polar is recognised as a world leader in production line impedance testing. Polar's innovative product portfolio includes the Toneohm 950 short circuit locator which is able to pinpoint the physical location of shorts between maximum copper layers.\n\n\n\n                                Speedstack SI:\n\nSpeedstack Si  is a packaged combination of the Si9000 field solving PCB Transmission Line Design System and Speedstack professional Layer Stackup Design software. If you need both powerful and accurate field solvers to predict your printed circuit board performance and layer stackup / buildup documentation the Speedstack Si offers a considerable saving over purchasing separate licences. \n\nSpeedstack Si is ideal for you if:\n\n    You need to calculate impedance requirements and model loss on multilayer boards with multiple controlled impedance structures per stack.\n\n    You need to extract engineering information to drive simulation software prior to committing a design into production.\n\n    You need to experiment with differing stack up approaches ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ for example, you can substitute material because of a shortage and rapidly check the new overall height, line width and transmission line impedance values. By employing the link between the Si9000e transmission line design system and Speedstack software you can recalculate all the impedance values in a single pass in a fraction of the time taken traditionally.  \n\n    You need to alter line widths and rapidly communicate the new build information electronically.\n\n\n\n\n\n             NEW: CGen PCB ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ Impedance coupon generator\n              and CGen Si ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ Loss goupon generator (Beta)\n\nCGen Coupon Generator reduces the time-consuming process of creating impedance coupons manually to just a few minutes, adding powerful new features that give coupon generation new levels of control and flexibility.\n\nCGen PCB Coupon Generator is an automatic impedance coupon generator that allows you to create a controlled impedance test coupon from scratch or import finished stacks from Speedstack PCB and Speedstack Si or structures from the Polar Si8000 and Si9000 field solvers.\n\nCGen Si (Beta) incorporates all the features of CGen and adds insertion loss coupon capability. Please note designs for insertion loss coupons are still being fine tuned by OEMs and final adjustment of launch and via structures may still be required. If in any doubt - please check with your design authority.\n\nCGen includes powerful time-saving features\n\n    Choice of single-ended and differential-loss coupon styles\n    Choice of test probe footprints\n    Easily add, remove or replace layers\n    Preview edits in real-time\n    Track changes and highlight errors\n    Dynamically adjust copper thieving\n    Automatically engineer test probe interconnects\n\nCreate your impedance controlled stackup in CGen itself\n\nUsing CGen you can create your coupon from scratch, defining symmetry, the number of layers and layer type and then adding impedance structures as required.:\n\nImport finished stacks from Speedstack\n\nExport your completed stack from Speedstack and import into CGen, choose your probe, and generate your preferred coupon style.
