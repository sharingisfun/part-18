En route, a member of his team turns out to be a traitor and shoots Jon in the head while kidnapping the scientist. When Jon wakes up in the hospital, a doctor tells him that within weeks, the bullet in his brain will cause complete paralysis. Jon returns to Beijing to see his mother, who confesses that Jon has a brother in Malaysia who was raised by his father, a gambler. Jon takes a flight to Malaysia to find his brother, Yeung. On the plane he forms a bond with Dr. Kan, who promises to look into possible treatments for his condition. However, when they arrive, Yeung tries to kidnap the doctor and when Jon intervenes, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also taken hostage. The two soon realize theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re brothers, and decide to work together in order to keep the criminals behind the kidnappings from reinfecting the world of a disease long thought cured.\n\nGenre: Action | Drama\nIMDB rating: 6.3/10\nDirected by: Dante Lam\nStarring: Carl Ng, Bing Bai and Jay Chou\n\nRelease Name: The.Viral.Factor.2012.BDRip.HC.SUBS.Ac3.Xvid-ANALOG\nSize: 1.82 GB\nVideo: XviD, 720Ãƒâ€”304, 1738 Kbps, 24.000 fps\nAudio: English/Cantonese, AC3, 384 Kbps\nRuntime: 2h 2mn\nSubtitle: English HC\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f03ac70735b3fc585a1aa981cdb48ad5ed2d7e","amp;dn":"The.Viral.Factor.2012.BDRip.HC.SUBS.Ac3.Xvid-ANALOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39f03ac70735b3fc585a1aa981cdb48ad5ed2d7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,240,58,199,7,53,179,252,88,90,26,169,129,205,180,138,213,237,45,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
