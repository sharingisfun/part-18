His writings on Christianity's role in the secular world have become widely influential, and many have labelled his book The Cost of Discipleship a modern classic.[1] Apart from his theological writings, Bonhoeffer became known for his staunch resistance to the Nazi dictatorship. He strongly opposed Hitler's euthanasia program and genocidal persecution of the Jews.[2] He was also involved in plans by members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office) to assassinate Adolf Hitler. He was arrested in April 1943 by the Gestapo and executed by hanging in April 1945 while imprisoned at a Nazi concentration camp, just 23 days before the German surrender.\n\nSee documentaries this site - UnviolentPeacemaker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b3f2f25ee1122545454a751539e28ba7a42b3e3","amp;dn":"The+Cost+of+Discipleship+-+Dietrich+Bonhoeffer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b3f2f25ee1122545454a751539e28ba7a42b3e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,63,47,37,238,17,34,84,84,84,167,81,83,158,40,186,122,66,179,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
