In late 2001, Kapranos and Hardy had begun working on music together when they met McCarthy, a classically trained pianist and double bass player who originally played drums for the group despite no prior experience as a drummer. The trio had been rehearsing at McCarthy's house for a while when they met and started playing with Thomson, a former drummer for the Yummy Fur who felt like playing guitar instead. Eventually, McCarthy and Thomson switched to guitar and drums, and the band switched practice spaces, stumbling upon an abandoned warehouse that they named the Chateau.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b4be9897ec6705c32f488cc6b521abbd5bf75c","amp;dn":"Franz+Ferdinand+-+Right+Thoughts+Right+Words+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b4be9897ec6705c32f488cc6b521abbd5bf75c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,180,190,152,151,236,103,5,195,47,72,140,198,181,33,171,189,91,247,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
