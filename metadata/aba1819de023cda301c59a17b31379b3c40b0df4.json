Unprepared for the hostile environment and crushing pressures, GrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team faced certain death as their ship malfunctioned and slowly sank to the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depths. However, one of JupiterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s native creaturesÃ¢â‚¬â€a city-sized leviathanÃ¢â‚¬â€saved the doomed ship. This creatureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s act convinced Grant that they were intelligent, but he lacked scientific proof. Now, several years later, Grant prepares a new expedition to prove it once and for all. The new team faces dangers from both the hostile environment and from humans who will do anything to make sure the mission is a failureÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means murdering the entire crew.\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Cassandra Campbell, Gabrielle de Cuir, Samantha Eggar, Rosalyn Landor, Stefan Rudnicki, Judy Young\nLength: 15 hrs and 14 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:02-01-11\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aba1819de023cda301c59a17b31379b3c40b0df4","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+Leviathans+of+Jupiter+%28The+Grand+Tour+%2319%29+%5BAUDIBLE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aba1819de023cda301c59a17b31379b3c40b0df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,161,129,157,224,35,205,163,1,197,154,23,179,19,121,179,196,11,13,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
