Cloward, and his then research associate Frances Fox Piven, wrote a pivotal article in The Nation, articulating Ã¢â‚¬Å“a strategy to end poverty.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe solution to ending poverty, Cloward and Piven argued, demanded expanding the government welfare state should expand beyond providing Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and food stamps to establish a Ã¢â‚¬Å“guaranteed annual incomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of at lest $100,000 a year as an entitlement for all Americans as a constitutional right the poor could demand government must pay.\nHaving concluded that a capitalist system would never apply capital fairly to fulfill the social welfare needs of workers, the two Columbia University-based sociologists concluded that a progressive strategy of voting ever-expanding social welfare programs could push the capitalist system to the breaking point.\n\nBarack Obama and the radical left activists now in control of the Democratic Party see the Cloward/Piven theory as predicting a welfare state expanded to the point where the accumulated national debt bankrupts the USA. At that point, the Cloward/Piven theory predicts capitalism will collapse such that the USA can be reconstructed as a truly socialist state dedicated to the elimination of private property and the creation of Ã¢â‚¬Å“social justiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ achieved by redistributing income from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“havesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“have-nots.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis book, ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Plan to Bankrupt the USA: the Cloward/Piven Theory is a companion book to Dr. CorsiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ebook, Saul Alinsky: the Evil Genius Behind Obama.\n\nSaul AlinskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tactics of power politics explain why Obama continually fans the flames of class warfare. In his 2012 presidential campaign, Obama followed the Saul Alinsky playbook chapter and verse, campaigning on the theme to Ã¢â‚¬Å“tax the rich.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ When the accumulated U.S. debt causes a credit downgrade in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second term, Obama and the radical left will continue to blame capitalism and Ã¢â‚¬Å“the richÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be blamed.\n\nIn the last stages of credit default and technical bankruptcy, the Cloward/Piven theory explains why Americans will abandon the Constitution in favor of establishing a socialist state.\nUnderstanding ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan to bankrupt the USA is essential to any plan to return the USA to financial solvency by reducing government spending and containing the expansion of the welfare state.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Jerome R.
