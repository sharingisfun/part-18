When the Athenians took off in ships to recover their fabled noble daughter Helen from Paris of Troy, their sailing ships were stalled for lack of wind among a group of islands. They didn't have enough food onboard for a long stay at sea, and some of the expedition leaders, including Agamemnon (Costa Cazakos) and Meneleas (Costa Carras), the cuckolded husband of Helen, decide to go ashore and kill some deer. However, they know that those particular deer are sacred to the gods, and that killing them would bring a curse for impiety onto the whole group. The head of the expedition, on examining the subsequent oracles, tells Agamemnon that the Athenian fleet will have no wind until he sacrifices his own daughter Iphigehnia (Tatiana Papamoskou) to atone for the death of the sacred deer. Clytemnestre (Irene Papas), the girl's mother, tries everything in her power to prevent the sacrifice but is unsuccessful. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076208/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076208/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSpan subs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3639917/ifigeneia-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3639917/ifigeneia-es&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_%28film%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_%28film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nMihalis Kakogiannis\n\n\n        Irene Papas\t ... \tKlytaimnistra (as Eirini Papa)\n\tKostas Kazakos\t... \tAgamemnonas\n\tKostas Karras\t... \tMenelaos\n\tTatiana Papamoschou\t... \tIfigeneia\n\tChristos Tsagas\t... \tOdysseas\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:47:25\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x384 1.67:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1480 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,21 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17a1d6968f3f61a7fed53a8b137c17a96aeebe3","amp;dn":"Ifigeneia+%281977%29+Irene+Pappas+Grc+%28Eng+subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17a1d6968f3f61a7fed53a8b137c17a96aeebe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,122,29,105,104,243,246,26,127,237,83,168,177,55,193,122,150,174,235,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
