Dan Cruickshank travels across the world, celebrating different types of architecture and showing how our buildings reveal our aspirations, our ingenuity and our beliefs. \n\nIn each programme, buildings from all over the world are dramatically juxtaposed, revealing unexpected connections between very different types of architecture. From the Kizhi Cathedral in remote northwest Russia to the convent of St Catherine in Sinai, Egypt, and themes that range from beauty, to power, paradise and pleasure, this series is a monumental journey that takes in some monumental structures, gradually building an architectural knowledge so that, through the series, a story of world architecture is told.\n\nWhat do the buildings we construct say about us as people?\n\n\nEpisode 1 - Beauty\nGreenland - Igloo\nChina - Leshan Giant Buddha \nRussia - Catherine Palace \nIndia - Konark Sun Temple \nFrance - Albi Cathedral \n\n\nEpisode 2 - Death\nEgypt - Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut \nCzech Republic - Sedlec Ossuary\nGuatemala - Yaxha \nItaly - Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno \nIndia - Varanasi \n\n\nEpisode 3 - Paradise\nEgypt - St Catherine's Monastery \nChina - Hanging Monastery of Heng Shan \nTurkey - Soleymaniye Mosque \nRussia - Kizhi \nIndia - Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple \n\n\nEpisode 4 - Disaster\nGermany - Dresden \nSyria - Palmyra \nUnited States - San Francisco earthquake defences \nAfghanistan - Minaret of Jam \n\n\nEpisode 5 - Connections\nBrazil - Brasilia \nSyria - Damascus \nUnited States - Rockefeller Center \nIndia - Dharavi \n\n\nEpisode 6 - Power\nRomania - Palace of the Parliament \nSyria - Marqab Castle \nUnited States - Evergreen Plantation \nTurkey - Topkap1 Harem \nKazakhstan - Astana \n\n\nEpisode 7 - Dreams\nYemen - Shibam \nDominican Republic - Santo Domingo\nUnited States - Eastern State Penitentiary \nBhutan - Thimphu \n\n\nEpisode 8 - Pleasure\nIndia - Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai \nGermany - Neuschwanstein Castle, Bavaria \nItaly - Pompeii \nBrazil - Teatro amazonas, Manaus \nItaly - Villa Barbaro \n\n\n\nepisode content detail &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Cruickshank's_Adventures_in_Architecture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Cruickshank's_Adventures_in_Architecture&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo: XVID 624x352 25.00fps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 120Kbps\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bace74524c450259f9ea6e2c342879a1f11b147","amp;dn":"Dan+Cruickshank%5C%27s+Adventures+in+Architecture++%28BBC%3A+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bace74524c450259f9ea6e2c342879a1f11b147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,172,231,69,36,196,80,37,159,158,166,226,195,66,135,154,31,17,177,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
