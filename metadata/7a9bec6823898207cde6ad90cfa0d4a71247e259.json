One was an orphaned puppy, abandoned by his owners as they fled Nazi forces. The other was a different kind of lost soulÃ¢â‚¬â€a Czech airman bound for the Royal Air Force and the country that he would come to call home.\nAirman Robert Bozdech stumbled across the tiny German shepherdÃ¢â‚¬â€whom he named AntÃ¢â‚¬â€after being shot down on a daring mission over enemy lines. Unable to desert his charge, Robert hid Ant inside his jacket as he escaped. In the months that followed the pair would save each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lives countless times as they flew together with Bomber Command. And though Ant was eventually grounded due to injury, he refused to abandon his duty, waiting patiently beside the runway for his masterÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s return from every sortie, and refusing food and sleep until they were reunited. By the end of the war Robert and Ant had become British war heroes, and Ant was justly awarded the Dickin Medal, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Animal VC.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nWith beautiful vintage black-and-white photos of Robert and Ant, The Dog Who Could Fly is a deeply moving story of loyalty in the face of adversity and the unshakable bond between a man and his best friend","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9bec6823898207cde6ad90cfa0d4a71247e259","amp;dn":"The+Dog+Who+Could+Fly+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9bec6823898207cde6ad90cfa0d4a71247e259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,155,236,104,35,137,130,7,205,230,173,144,207,160,212,167,18,71,226,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
