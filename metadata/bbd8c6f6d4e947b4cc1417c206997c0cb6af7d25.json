Gray, Peter M. Howley, Mark A. Israel and Craig B. Thompson.\n\nTEXTBOOK INFO: &lt;a href=&quot; https://elsevier.ca/product.jsp?isbn=9781455740666&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://elsevier.ca/product.jsp?isbn=9781455740666&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAUDIENCE: ...for students, researchers, and providers of clinical care from a variety of disciplines.\n\nPURPOSE: To describe the scientific underpinnings that will enable clinicians and other professionals who manage cancer patients to better understand the disease and its therapy. This book will be of equal, or possibly greater, interest to laboratory and clinical investigators in biomedical research and to advanced students and trainees, who need to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern the functioning and malfunctioning of malignant cells.\n\nCONTENTS:\n\nPART I  CARCINOGENESIS AND CANCER GENETICS\n1.
