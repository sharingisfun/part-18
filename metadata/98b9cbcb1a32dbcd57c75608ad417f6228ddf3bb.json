Well organized by topic, there are answers to just about any question one might have, from dog biting to landlord relationships, from leash laws to dog burials. Dog owners who read this book will save time, money, legal hassles, and possibly even a beloved dog's life. Summary: Informative, easy to read.Rating: 4Dog law is another outstanding legal book by Nolo press. I got the book because I was having problems with my neighbor's five barking dogs. I wanted to be informed of my rights before I confronted my neighbor. Although I had no luck coming to a compromise with my neighbor regarding the dogs (he is a crazy, paranoid, drug-addicted redneck), it was empowering to know my rights. The only small complaint was that it did not include state laws, but that may be beyond the scope of this book.Summary: Every dog owner and neighbor should read thisRating: 5If you are thinking about buying a dog (it explains puppy mills, contracts to consider when you buy a dog and licensing laws); you already have a dog (laws you might want to consider even if you're sure your dog is always well-behaved and how to get dog insurance); you want to provide for your dog after your death (what may or may not work in your will); you hate your neighbor's dog's barking (how to talk to your neighbor or seek mediation, or your liability if you are cruel or provoke the dog) or if you suspect your neighbor's dog is mistreated or are in any other way concerned about dogs: YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK. There is much more covered than what I have put here.I expected to read a few key chapters, but ended up reading it cover to cover. It contains interesting facts throughout (have you ever thought about the number of dogs injured/killed by riding in the back of a pick-up truck?), history of dog laws, real cases and the rulings in those cases (though obviously missing the recent case of Ms. Whipple's murder); and sound, common-sense advice whether it is written in the law or not.For the sake of the dogs and the people who own or are around them, I hope everybody will read this book.Summary: For anyone who might have a legal bone to pickRating: 5Now in a revised and updated 4th edition, Dog Law is a straightforward and comprehensive legal guide for dog owners -- and the neighbors of dog owners. Dog Law explains, in plan English terms easily accessible to the lay person, what the laws mandates with regard to barking dogs, dangerous dogs, cruelty to animals, dog bites, if a dog is injured or killed, and much more. Dog Law is a superbly presented, user friendly reference, and a &quot;must&quot; for dog owners, as well as for anyone else who might have a legal bone to pick!Summary: An excellent source of legal information for dog owners!Rating: 5I bought this book (Dog Law) years ago since I am a dog owner who would like to be aware of my rights and the rights of my dogs. Dog Law, By Mary Randolph is now in it's third publication, and I highly recommend it to all dog owners. Not only does the author focus on simple leash laws, barking cases, landlord restrictions, traveling with your dog, etc., but the author also focuses on criminal abuse cases and acts as a referral contact if you need help in the legal process yourself with a dog legal situation.Summary: Great OverviewRating: 5Dog Law gives a great overview of all sorts of legislation concerning dogs. Many owners know about general dog laws, like leash laws and curbing you dog, but Randolph covers much more. Things like dangerous dog laws, puppy lemon laws and laws concering veterinarians are covered. This book however, does not provide specific laws for individual states. Overall it is a great reference for the responsible dog owner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b9cbcb1a32dbcd57c75608ad417f6228ddf3bb","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2007%5D+Every+Dog%5C%27s+Legal+Guide+A+Must-have+Book+for+Your+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b9cbcb1a32dbcd57c75608ad417f6228ddf3bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,185,203,203,26,50,219,205,87,199,86,8,173,65,127,98,40,221,243,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
