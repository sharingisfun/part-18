Inside her mansion, she becomes trapped between floors in her elevator. She activates an emergency alarm but succeeds only in attracting the attention of the wino (Jeff Corey), who steals goods from her house and sells them to a fence. The wino visits Sade (Ann Sothern), a prostitute, who spreads the plight of Mrs. Hilyard's dilemma to three young hoods, Randall (James Caan), Elaine (Jennifer Billingsley), and Essie (Rafael Campos). \n\nThe trio follows the wino and the hooker back to the mansion, where they have an orgy, kill the wino, and lock Sade in a closet. Randall taunts Mrs. Hilyard and confronts her with a nasty suicide note from her son, Malcolm (William Swan).\n\nMrs. Hilyard, mustering up her strength, attempts to fight back against Randall and the two other goons.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a single redeeming character or characteristic to producer Luther DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sensationalistically vulgar screenplay.\n\nUtterly vile thriller with unpleasant characters.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.35gb\nDuration.... 01:30:46\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 572\nData Rate....1987kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 152kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a194f69150c8951693f76bae0df4c7859c0d865a","amp;dn":"Lady+in+a+Cage+1964+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a194f69150c8951693f76bae0df4c7859c0d865a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,148,246,145,80,200,149,22,147,247,107,174,13,244,199,133,156,13,134,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
