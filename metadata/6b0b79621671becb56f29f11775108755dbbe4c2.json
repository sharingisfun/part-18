In Seized, he takes us on a real-life journey into the mysterious world of freighters and shipping, where fortunes are made and lost by the whims of the waves. Desperate owners hire Max Hardberger to -extract- or steal back ships that have been illegitimately seized by putting together a mission-impossible team to sail them into international waters under cover of darkness. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a high stakes assignment-if Max or his crew are caught, they risk imprisonment or death.\nSeized takes readers behind the scenes of the multibillion dollar maritime industry, as he recounts his efforts to retrieve freighters and other vessels from New Orleans to the Caribbean, from East Germany to Vladivostak, Russia, and from Greece to Guatemala. He resorts to everything from disco dancing to women of the night to distract the shipyard guards, from bribes to voodoo doctors to divert attention and buy the time he needs to sail a ship out of a foreign port without clearance. Seized is adventure nonfiction at its best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0b79621671becb56f29f11775108755dbbe4c2","amp;dn":"Seized%3A+A+Sea+Captain%27s+Adventures+Battling+Scoundrels+and+Pirat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0b79621671becb56f29f11775108755dbbe4c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,11,121,98,22,113,190,203,86,242,159,17,119,81,8,117,93,187,228,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
