Moreover, she illustrates how the innovative formal experiments of uprooted writers and artists expanded the geographic and aesthetic boundaries of Chinese modernism far beyond the coastal cities of Shanghai and Beijing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd7ddf4113ab184a712e3685ba74397ca4c085f","amp;dn":"Fragmenting+Modernisms+-+Chinese+Wartime+Literature%2C+Art%2C+and+Fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd7ddf4113ab184a712e3685ba74397ca4c085f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,215,221,244,17,58,177,132,167,18,227,104,91,167,67,151,202,76,8,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
