Funny how the backward-glancers have become the most 'visionary' among us in these most desperate times; we revere those for whom there's a past beyond tomorrow, and Flemmons is nothing if not the most backward among the Denton rock crowd -- and that's the ultimate compliment. Dog is a gawldang throwdown and God-bless comedown, a CD that belongs on acetate in the Library of Congress basement-tapes archives. 'Pats the Rub' may well be the stompingest song you'll hear (or, likely, not) all year, and its follow-up, 'Evergone,' may be the saddest, especially when the thirtysomething Flemmons starts crooning like a 90-year-old man oooohing his last breath. At first, I thought Dog sounded like something recorded on a front porch; upon further inspection, more likely it was just found in a ditch, at the end of the rainbow.&quot; - Dallas Observer\n\n01\t 2/3rds Jim's Head\t\n02\t Pats The Rub\t\n03\t Sole, Spirit, Ghost\t\n04\t Wash Sheets / Walls Of Blood\t\n05\t Wrath You\t\n06\t Evergone\t\n07\t Goat Driver\t\n08\t Blue Suit Tobacco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167cbfb2179b0d634394dad8818ffe3974e27d29","amp;dn":"The+Baptist+Generals+-+Dog+%5B1998%5D%5BMP3+%2F+V0+%28VBR%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167cbfb2179b0d634394dad8818ffe3974e27d29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,124,191,178,23,155,13,99,67,148,218,216,129,143,254,57,116,226,125,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
