Vickery\nNorth Carolina State University\nPh.D., Yale University\n\n\nThe story of Africa is the oldest and most event-filled chronicle of human activity on the planet. These 36 half-hour lectures cover this great historical drama, tracing the story of the sub-Saharan region of the continent from the earliest evidence of human habitation to the latest challenges facing African nations in the 21 st century.\nFor many, Africa is a confusing fog of names, words, and places: Mandela, Biko, Mobutu, Lumumba, Lucy, Selassie, Rhodes, Livingstone, Swahili, Bantu, Boer, Zulu, Mau Mau, Tutsi/Hutu, Lesotho, and Timbuktu, to name just a few.\n\nThese lectures are designed to lift the fog and sharpen your understanding of these terms, revealing Africa in all its complexity, grandeur, tragedy, and resilience. As the chronological narrative of this course unfolds, Africa's people, places, languages, and customs will come vividly to life, and you will be able to follow events in present-day Africa in their deep historical context.\n\n\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n36 Lectures \n30 minutes / lecture\n1.\tFinding the &quot;Lost Continent&quot;\n2.\tAfrica's Many Natural Environments\n3.\tLecture 3: A Virtual Tour of the Great Land\n4.\tLecture 4-The Cradle of Humankind\n5.\tCrops, Cattle, IronÃ¢â‚¬â€Taming a Continent\n6.\tKinship and CommunityÃ¢â‚¬â€Societies Take Shape\n7.\tLike Nothing ElseÃ¢â‚¬â€The Ancient Nile Valley\n8.\tSoul and SpiritÃ¢â‚¬â€Religion in Africa\n9.\tEthiopiaÃ¢â‚¬â€Outpost of Christianity\n15.\tSouth AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â€The Dutch Cape Colony\n16.\tSouth AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â€The Zulu Kingdom\n17.\tSouth AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â€The Frontier and Unification\n18.\tSouth AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â€Diamonds and Gold\n19.\tPrelude to the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;\n20.\tEuropean Conquest and African Resistance\n21.\tColonial AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â€New Realities\n22.\tColonial AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â€Comparisons and Change\n23.\tThe Lion AwakensÃ¢â‚¬â€The Rise of Nationalism\n24.\tThe Peaceful Paths to Independence\n25.\tThe CongoÃ¢â‚¬â€Promise and Pain\n26.\tSegregation to Apartheid in South Africa\n27.\tThe Armed Struggles for Independence\n28.\tThe First Taste of Freedom\n29.\tThe Taste Turns Sour\n30.\tThe World Turns DownÃ¢â‚¬â€The &quot;Permanent Crisis&quot;\n31.\tA New Dawn?
