This release was compiled from two performances at the famed Fillmore West on February 7 &amp; 8, 1969. The album includes several songs not found on the group's studio albums.\n\nRecorded less than a week after the release of The Byrds' album, Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde, the band line-up on these recordings includes lead singer and guitarist, Roger McGuinn, lead guitarist Clarence White, bassist John York, and drummer Gene Parsons. The album features White's use of the Stringbender device, which he co-invented with drummer (and banjo player) Gene Parsons. The Stringbender allowed White to make his Telecaster guitar sound like a pedal steel guitar.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Nashville West&quot; (Gene Parsons, Clarence White) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:57\n    &quot;You're Still on My Mind&quot; (Luke McDaniel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:57\n    &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; (Woody Guthrie) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n    &quot;Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man&quot; (Roger McGuinn, Gram Parsons) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:28\n    &quot;Medley: Turn!
