An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings, however, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit, &quot;Move It&quot; (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock &amp; roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these, although it was by no means one of the more successful, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad &quot;Blue Turns to Grey&quot;).\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-richard-p5265/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-richard-p5265/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Dave Thompson):\n\nThough he never dredged the same depths as Elvis, there is little doubt that Cliff Richard made some really horrible movies. There were three of them -- Finders Keepers, Two a Penny, and the truly execrable Take Me High -- and one could search the earth for the rest of one's life and still never find anyone who would admit to enjoying them. So it's absolutely astonishing to discover that not only do the accompanying soundtracks stand proud alongside some of Richard's regular albums, they don't look too shoddy up there with his best ones, either. And the fact that category includes two other soundtracks just goes to prove your old granny was right all along. You really can't judge a movie score by the movie. At the time of his breakthrough, in 1958, Richard was (in the parlance of the day), &quot;the boy who rocked the world.&quot; Little Richard was passe, Elvis was past it, Jerry Lee was, well, we've all seen Great Balls of Fire, so let's just leave it at that. So far as the British entertainment industry was concerned, America had already had its rock &amp; rolling day; now it was their turn, and Cliff Richard was still coming down from his first hit single, the magnificent moodiness of &quot;Move It,&quot; when he was co-opted for his first film, Serious Charge. The gritty realism of the movie's theme summed up Cliff's box office appeal. He was rough, he was tough, and the songs he performed on the soundtrack, &quot;No Turning Back&quot; and &quot;Mad About You&quot; (both making their CD debuts here), adhered perfectly to that image. So did a third number, the rollicking &quot;Living Doll,&quot; but Richard soon changed that. Although the singer loved the song, he disliked its up-tempo rock arrangement, and by the time it became his first number one, &quot;Living Doll&quot; had been transformed into his first major ballad, and the template around which much of his subsequent career would be designed. ...\n\nSee all at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/at-the-movies-r260818/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/at-the-movies-r260818/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000073C6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000073C6&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
