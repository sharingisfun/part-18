The album was released in a single CD edition, along with a deluxe version. It is the last album in Aerosmith's current recording contract with Sony/Columbia Records and was produced by Jack Douglas, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry and Marti Frederiksen (three tracks). The album includes the singles &quot;Legendary Child,&quot; &quot;Lover Alot,&quot; &quot;What Could Have Been Love,&quot; and &quot;Can't Stop Lovin' You&quot;.\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nEditorial Reviews\nMUSIC FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION presents AEROSMITH in ferociously fine form and at the peak of their powers. They're the only band of their stature with all-original members who are playing better than they ever have before. The album abounds with one highlight after another, including &quot;Out Go The Lights,&quot; &quot;Oh Yeah,&quot; &quot;Luv XXX,&quot; &quot;We All Fall Down,&quot; &quot;Street Jesus&quot; and &quot;Can t Stop Loving You,&quot; on which Tyler duets with Carrie Underwood. The album also includes &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot; which features Johnny Depp on backing vocals. \nIt marks the band's 15th studio album and their first studio album of all-new material in 11 years. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and at the band s studio in Massachusetts; it was produced by Jack Douglas, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, with the exception of three tracks produced by Tyler and Marti Frederiksen. \n&quot;This is the album we wanted to make since the band got back together in 1984,&quot; JOE PERRY says. &quot;Can't complain about number one singles or album-driven sold-out world tours, as we blaze the Aerosmith trail with our fans. But this is the record that when the five of us are in a room yelling turn up the volume, that room could be 1325 Commonwealth Avenue. \nSource:Amazon\n\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Hard Rock\nQuality: 320 kbps\nTracklist:\n\nAerosmith - Music From Another Dimension!
