The film Sounds and Silence: Travels with Manfred Eicher was released in 2009 and this 2011 soundtrack album is made up largely of tracks taken from previously released ECM albums that Eicher produced, some from as early as 1980. Most of the pieces are low-key and understated and feature chamber ensembles, although there are several piano tracks and several featuring orchestra or chorus. The album has a mix of selections from ECM's classical and jazz repertoire, and from the label's specialty, the many pieces that lie somewhere in between the two. The artists include pianist Keith Jarrett, saxophonists Jan Garbarek and Gianluigi Trovesi, violist Kim Kashkashian, the duo of bandoneon player Dino Saluzzi and cellist Anja Lechner, and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir led by Tonu Kaljuste. The album offers a good sampling of ECM's offerings (although it steers clear of the more avant-garde music) and should whet listeners' appetites for seeking out the releases from which these tracks were taken.\n~ Stephen Eddins @ allmusic.com\n\n\n\n[b]:: Release Info ::[/b]\nRecording Date: 1980-2008\nRelease Date: 2011\nLabel: ECM\nCatalog #: ECM 2250\n\n\n\n[b]:: Credits ::[/b]\nGeorges I.
