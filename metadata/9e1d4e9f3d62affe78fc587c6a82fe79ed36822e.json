Filled with irony, surprises, and long-hidden secrets, the book does more than revise American history, it reinvents it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€James Bamford,\nbestselling author of The Puzzle Palace, Body of Secrets, and The Shadow Factory\n \n \nThis spirited reexamination of American history delves into our past to expose hundreds ofstartling facts that never made it into the textbooks, and highlights how little-known peopleand events played surprisingly influential roles in the great American story. \n \nWe tend to think of history as settled, set in stone, but American History Revised reveals a past that is filled with ironies, surprises, and misconceptions. Living abroad for twelve years gave author Seymour Morris Jr. the opportunity to view his country as an outsider and compelled him to examine American history from a fresh perspective. As Morris colorfully illustrates through the 200\nhistorical vignettes that make up this book, much of our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past is quite differentÃ¢â‚¬â€and far more remarkableÃ¢â‚¬â€than we thought.\n      We discover that:\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In the 1950s Ford was approached by two Japanese companies begging for a joint venture. Ford declined their offers, calling them makers of Ã¢â‚¬Å“tin cars.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The two companies were Toyota and Nissan.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Eleanor Roosevelt and most womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s groups opposed the Equal Rights Amendment\nforbidding gender discrimination.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The two generals who ended the Civil War werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Grant and Lee.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The #1 bestselling American book of all time was written in one day.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Dutch made a bad investment buying Manhattan for $24.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Two young girls aimed someday to become First LadyÃ¢â‚¬â€and succeeded.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Three times, a private financier saved the United States from bankruptcy.\n \n      Organized into ten thematic chapters, American History Revised plumbs American historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s numerous inconsistencies, twists, and turns to make it come alive again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/American-History-Revised-Startling-Textbooks/dp/0307587606/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373452842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=american+history+revised&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/American-History-Revised-Startling-Textbooks/dp/0307587606/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373452842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=american+history+revised&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e1d4e9f3d62affe78fc587c6a82fe79ed36822e","amp;dn":"American+History+Revised%3A+200+Startling+Facts+That+Never+Made+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e1d4e9f3d62affe78fc587c6a82fe79ed36822e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,29,78,159,61,98,175,254,120,252,88,124,106,130,254,121,237,54,130,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
