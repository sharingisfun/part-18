Translation and the Classic uses this idea to discuss the relationship between translation and the classic text. It proposes a framework in which 'the classic' figures less as an autonomous entity than as the result of the interplay between source text and translation practice and examines the consequences of this hypothesis for questioning established definitions of the classic: how does translation mediate the social, political and national uses of 'the classics' in the contemporary global context of changing canons and traditions?\nThe volume contains a total of eighteen original essays, plus an introduction, written by scholars working in classics and classical reception, translation studies, literary theory, comparative literature, theatre and performance studies, history and philosophy and makes a potent contribution to pressing debates in all of these areas.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\n''...this is suggestive and very wide-ranging collection of essays has much to offer classicists of many kinds...excellent work Victoria Moul Bryn Mawr Classical Review it will make an ideal teaching companion for graduate courses on classics and translation.''
