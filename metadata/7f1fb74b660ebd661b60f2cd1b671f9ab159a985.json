Much to her annoyance, she is accompanied by a thirty-six-year-old chaperone, who is neither mother nor friend. Cora Carlisle, a complicated but traditional woman with her own reasons for making the trip, has no idea what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in for. Young Louise, already stunningly beautiful and sporting her famous black bob with blunt bangs, is known for her arrogance and her lack of respect for convention. Ultimately, the five weeks they spend together will transform their lives forever.\n \nFor Cora, the city holds the promise of discovery that might answer the question at the core of her being, and even as she does her best to watch over Louise in this strange and bustling place she embarks on a mission of her own. And while what she finds isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what she anticipated, she is liberated in a way she could not have imagined. Over the course of CoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship with Louise, her eyes are opened to the promise of the twentieth century and a new understanding of the possibilities for being fully alive.\n \nDrawing on the rich history of the 1920s,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢30s, and beyondÃ¢â‚¬â€from the orphan trains to Prohibition, flappers,  and the onset of the Great Depression to the burgeoning movement for equal rights and new opportunities for womenÃ¢â‚¬â€Laura MoriartyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Chaperone illustrates how rapidly everything, from fashion and hemlines to values and attitudes, was changing at this time and what a vast difference it all made for Louise Brooks, Cora Carlisle, and others like them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f1fb74b660ebd661b60f2cd1b671f9ab159a985","amp;dn":"The+Chaperone+-+Laura+Moriarty.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f1fb74b660ebd661b60f2cd1b671f9ab159a985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,31,183,75,102,14,189,102,27,96,242,205,27,103,31,154,177,89,169,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
