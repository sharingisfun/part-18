It was initially intended as a creative outlet for the Beatles, both as a group and individually, plus a selection of other artists including Mary Hopkin, James Taylor, Badfinger, and Billy Preston. In practice, by the mid-1970s, the roster had become dominated with releases by the former Beatles as solo artists. Allen Klein ran the label in 1969. It was then run by Neil Aspinall on behalf of the four Beatles and their heirs. He retired in 2007 and was replaced by Jeff Jones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome And Get It: The Best Of Apple Records 2010\n\n\nCome and Get It: The Best of Apple Records is a greatest hits compilation album containing songs released by The Beatles' Apple Records between 1968-1973. The compilation was released on October 25, 2010 (see 2010 in British music).\n\nThe compilation accompanies a massive campaign by Apple Corps Ltd. and EMI Music to reissue the albums originally released by The Beatles' record label, and the project and remastered albums are led by the same team of engineers that worked on The Beatles' 2009 remastered albums, John Lennon's 2010 remastered albums, and sixteen other 2010 remastered albums by various other artists (a song from each of these sixteen albums is on Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records).\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Those Were the Days&quot; Mary Hopkin\n2.\t&quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; James Taylor\n3.\t&quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; The Iveys\n4.\t&quot;Thingumybob&quot; The Black Dyke Mills Band\n5.\t&quot;King of Fuh&quot; \tBrute Force\n6.\t&quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot; Jackie Lomax\n7.\t&quot;Goodbye&quot; Mary Hopkin\n8.\t&quot;That's the Way God Planned It&quot; Billy Preston\n9.\t&quot;New Day&quot; Jackie Lomax\n10.\t&quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;/&quot;Carry That Weight&quot; Trash\n11.\t&quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; Hot Chocolate\n12.\t&quot;Come and Get It&quot; Badfinger\n13.\t&quot;Ain't That Cute&quot; Doris Troy\n14.\t&quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; Billy Preston\n15.\t&quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot; Ronnie Spector\n16.\t&quot;Govinda&quot; Radha Krishna Temple\n17.\t&quot;We're On Our Way&quot; \tChris Hodge\n18.\t&quot;Saturday Nite Special&quot; The Sundown Playboys\n19.\t&quot;God Save Us&quot; Bill Elliot &amp; The Elastic Oz Band\n20.\t&quot;Sweet Music&quot; Lon &amp; Derrek van Eaton\n21.\t&quot;Day After Day&quot; Badfinger\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33b30622d44abfaf663c373919d41b5b9ebf8737","amp;dn":"Come+and+Get+It+-+Best+of+Apple+Records+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33b30622d44abfaf663c373919d41b5b9ebf8737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,179,6,34,212,74,191,175,102,60,55,57,25,212,27,91,158,191,135,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
