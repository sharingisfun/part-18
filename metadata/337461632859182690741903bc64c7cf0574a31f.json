When Max Andrews, the much-loved and handsome \n(lonely and gay) host of Slumber Party Sundown, accidentally exposes \nhimself in front of 60 million kids and their parents during a &quot;Toys for Tots&quot; \nsegment, Sellevision faces its first big scandal. As Max fails to find a job in \ntelevision, another host, the popular and perky Peggy Jean Smythe, is \nreceiving sinister e-mails about her appearance from a stalker. Popping pills \nand drinking heavily, she fails to notice that her husband is spending a lot \nmore time with the young babysitter who lives next door. Then there&amp;#039;s Leigh, \nwhose affair with Sellevision boss Howard Toast is going nowhere until she \nexposes him on air; and Bebe, Sellevision&amp;#039;s star host, who finds Mr. Right \nthrough the internetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if she can just stop her shopping addiction from taking \nover.\n\n----\n\nAugusten Burroughs is the author of Running with Scissors, Dry, Magical \nThinking, and Possible Side Effects, all of which have been New York Times \nbestsellers and are published around the world. A film version of Running with \nScissors, starring Annette Bening and Gwyneth Paltrow, was adapted for the \nscreen by Ryan Murphy. Augusten has been named one of the fifteen \nfunniest people in America by Entertainment Weekly. He lives in New York \nCity and western Massachusetts.
