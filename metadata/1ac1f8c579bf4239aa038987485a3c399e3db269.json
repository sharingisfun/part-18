Ever since childhood they've been able to start fires with their minds but following a tragedy in which they accidentally killed a man, the brothers have grown up very differently. Wilder has become a regular 9-5 workaday joe but Wallace performs his feats with a traveling circus. When the circus comes to Wilder's home town Wallace starts coming on strong to Wilder's wife, Vida who, ironically, is a slight pyromaniac.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ac1f8c579bf4239aa038987485a3c399e3db269","amp;dn":"Wilder+Napalm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ac1f8c579bf4239aa038987485a3c399e3db269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,193,248,197,121,191,66,57,170,3,137,135,72,90,60,57,158,61,178,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
