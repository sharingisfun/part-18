Many players left this game at that time because it was too difficult and ranged themselves with rival sensible soccer. It is so fast that some call it pinball soccer. I have played over 500 games of this remake in the easiest difficulty setting because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard without control of the ball. I wonder how they can play this game as it is meant to be played. Forget about pro evolution, this is not a realistic football (soccer for the americans) game. Thanks goes to the battery team for the crack. I think they also fixed some balance issues and you have to work harder to win now. They obviously added more languages for the menus (norwegian, swedish, portugese, danish, dutch and turkish), more music tracks and a referee called F. Zappa. You can choose from over 200 national teams and lead them to glory through leagues, cups and world cups or challenge teams and winning them one by one. You can also create your own teams with the easy to use editor. Just unrar, install and then follow the easy instructions. Enjoy and seed!\n\n\nP.S.: I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know if this bug is caused by the crack or it's because multi cpus, but in some games when you shoot the ball it will just stop in a spot of the field without reason. I had never experienced this with the cd version but then i had an Athlon XP 1600+. So i suggest you either to start the match again or leave one processor running and the problem should be solved.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96fa377f340f251d489a9d9c8c47c3dfa3195230","amp;dn":"kick+off+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96fa377f340f251d489a9d9c8c47c3dfa3195230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,250,55,127,52,15,37,29,72,154,157,156,140,71,195,223,163,25,82,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
