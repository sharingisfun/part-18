Each monthly segment is followed by a classic episode of Doctor Who.\n\nThis episode will focus on the 3rd Doctor as played by Jon Pertwee from 1970 to 1974. This upload includes only the first 26 minutes of the special that includes the interviews and retrospective of the Pertwee years. The episode that followed, &quot;Spearhead From Space&quot; is not included here as the first part of this is all I could find elsewhere online.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af861242556d77c7e8fce5a4d0647845f78cf741","amp;dn":"The+Doctors+Revisited+-+The+Third+Doctor+Jon+Pertwee+-+Part+3+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af861242556d77c7e8fce5a4d0647845f78cf741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,134,18,66,85,109,119,199,232,252,229,164,208,100,120,69,247,140,247,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
