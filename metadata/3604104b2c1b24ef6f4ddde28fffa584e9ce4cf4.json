They live, not only with the fear of discovery, contending with neighboring Soviet partisans and knowing whom to trust but also take the responsibility of looking after a large mass of fleeing Polish Jews from the German war machine. Women, men, children, the elderly and the young alike are all hiding in makeshift homes in the dark, cold and unforgiving forests in the darkest times of German occupied Eastern Europe.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034303/\nRelease Date: 16 January 2009 (USA)\nGenre: Action | Drama | History\nStars: Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p.BluRay.x264-HDEFiNiTiON\nSize: 950MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3604104b2c1b24ef6f4ddde28fffa584e9ce4cf4","amp;dn":"Defiance+%282008%29+BluRay+720p+950MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3604104b2c1b24ef6f4ddde28fffa584e9ce4cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,4,16,75,44,27,36,239,111,77,221,226,143,255,165,132,233,206,76,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
