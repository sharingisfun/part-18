Outnumbered... Outgunned... Behind enemy lines... What happens when the tables are turned and the hunter becomes the hunted? This is SNIPER: DEADLIEST MISSIONS. From the treacherous jungles of Vietnam and the bloody war zones of Iraq, to danger high in the skies of the Alaskan wilderness, this two-hour special puts you behind the scope with the men who pulled the trigger on some of the deadliest missions in military and law enforcement history. Gripping firsthand accounts, 3-D graphics and jaw-dropping shooting demonstrations take you inside the shadowy world of top snipers and the missions that made them living legends. Outmanned and outgunned - will the next shot be their last? \n\nBAIT AND KILL\n\nSgt. Byron Hancock, USMC Sniper\n\nM40A3 Sniper Rifles (7.62ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€51mm - 175 gr. M118LR)\n\nHit, Iraq 2004\n\nCounter-Sniper Operations\n\nOperation Phantom Fury: Fallujah, Iraq 2004 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he took out a two-man mortar team at 1,050 yards the longest kill with a 7.62mm round at that time.\n\n&quot;There's no greater bait than live baitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nEnemy was a skilled Syrian-trained sniper.\n\nScouting for potential enemy hides and ranging it.\n\nCounter sniping Crack / Thump method. Crack is the sound of the bullet whizzing by at supersonic speed. The thump that follows is the actual report of the rifle. The time elapsed between the crack and the thump reveals the distance between the shooter and his target. In this case it was 2 seconds which translates to 600 yards for the M40A3. Entered distances for every landmark in that 600 range into his Data Book. He catches a glint from the enemy sniper's scope. You concentrate on your breathing, trigger control, sight alignment, sight picture. Focusing on the crosshairs. You're not focusing on him as a target.\n\n\nSTALKING THE APACHE\n\nGySgt Carlos Hathcock II, USMC\n\nWinchester Model 70 (30.06)\n\nHill 55 Vietnam, 1965\n\nFemale Viet Cong sniper who tortured captured Americans.\n\nHathcock: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShe's a very bad woman.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n600 yards\n\n\nTHE SUICIDE MISSION\n\nGySgt Carlos Hathcock II, USMC\n\nWinchester Model 70 (30.06)\n\nTake out NVA General\n\n2,000 yards from the enemy. Crawl (skull drag -- your face is on the ground, on the deck, and you are dragging slowly towards your target) 1,300 yards in three days and take a 700 yard shot from the Final Firing Position (FFP) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Use of dead space, movement.\n\nAim for the heart and adjust for wind using mirage.\n\nTraveling at over twice the speed of sound, the bullet hits the general before he hears the shot.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHigh Caliber Training FacilitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Memphis, Tennessee. 10% Ballistic Gelatin for reenactment\n\n\nDEATH FROM ABOVE\n\nLt. Jeff Hall and his partner Troy Duncan, SERT State Troopers\n\nM16-A1 (5.56x45mm) with 4x fixed Colt scope semi-auto and one with iron sights in full auto. 20 round magazines with tracers.\n\nAlaska, 1984\n\nDrifter/End-of-the-roader: Michael Alan Silka, 30.06 hunting rifle with 4x fixed Weaver scope, ex-military and an expert shot\n\nHelicopter shots hovering 50 yards from the target\n\nHelicopter moving to the right and missed to the right so he took a negative lead to compensate for the forward momentum of the helicopter. Second burst from Hall hit Silka eight times.\n\nReenactments and helo training:\n\nDillon Arerial Platform System: Leads and points of aim are dependent on a number of factors: speed, height and direction of aircraft, as well as speed, distance and direction of target. It's about math formulas and training. Hall references an aerial rifle chart and adjusts his DOPE. He corrects for a number of secondary forces acting on the bullet, including jump, from the slipstream of the aircraft, gravity, the effects of aerodynamic drag and spin drift. The helicopter moves past the target at 40 knots. The target is 100 meters away, meaning his lag, or negative lead, is 9.2 feet.\n\n\nHOGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S TOOTH\n\nWhen a Marine graduates Scout Sniper School, he makes the transition from PIG (Professional Instructed Gunman) to HOG (Hunter OF Gunmen). When a marine graduates Scout Sniper School, he's given a symbolic HOG's Tooth necklace. It's a cord and they have a bullet that has a hole drilled through it, and they put that around your neck. And that's supposed to mean that you have control of the round that was meant for you. It's more of mythical thing than reality, but it's kind of something that symbolizes a Marine sniper. To get your real HOG's Tooth, you're supposed to kill an enemy sniper and take the round out of his chamber, and that's considered, the round that was meant for you, and therefore you're immortal.\n\nSgt Ethan Place, former Marine Sniper\n\nM40A3 Sniper Rifles (7.62ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€51mm - 175 gr.
