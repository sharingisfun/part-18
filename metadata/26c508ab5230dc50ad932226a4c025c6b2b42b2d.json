Space Invaders\n\nAlphonse Mouzon's &quot;Morning Sun&quot; may be one of the first Smooth Jazz recordings - recorded in 1981 with pretty much the same band as on Mouzon's &quot;By All Means&quot; album may be one of the defining Smooth Jazz albums, just at the time when Smooth Jazz was born.\n\nSongs like &quot;Lullaby for Little Alphonse&quot;, &quot;Morning Sun&quot; and &quot;When Linda Smiles&quot; are Smooth Jazz classics in their own right.\n\nBut &quot;Morning Sun&quot; is not only a pure Smooth Jazz recording. It also has Disco and Funk tracks on it like &quot;I'm glad you're here&quot;, which was released as a well doing single, and the funky &quot;If Tomorrow Comes&quot; with the great Herbie Hancock and Freddie Hubbard.\n\nAlphonse's drumming is funky on all tracks and on &quot;Just Because of you&quot; Alphonse is going crazy with his leader at that time, Herbie Hancock ( on Fender Rhodes).\n\nCheck out the release on Tenaciousrecords with two great bonus tracks off the masterpiece &quot;By All Means&quot;.\n\n&quot;Space Invaders&quot; may be one of the greatest and freakiest drum solos of it's time.\n\nLay back and enjoy early Smooth Jazz with a whole lot of Disco and Funk and check out the featured artists on this recording alongside Alphonse on drums, keys and vocals you get:\n\nHerbie Hancock, Lee Ritenour,Michael Brecker, Freddie Hubbard,Hubert Laws, Paul Jackson, Jr., Nathan East,Scott Edwards, Seawind Horns and The Waters Sisters!!!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c508ab5230dc50ad932226a4c025c6b2b42b2d","amp;dn":"Alphonse+Mouzon+-+Morning+Sun+%5B1981%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c508ab5230dc50ad932226a4c025c6b2b42b2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,197,8,171,82,48,220,80,173,147,34,38,164,192,37,198,178,180,43,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
