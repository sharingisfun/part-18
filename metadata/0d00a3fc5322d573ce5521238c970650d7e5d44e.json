Of interest is &quot;Everytime,&quot; a rare solo credit for bassist Greg Norton.\n\nOver half of the songs were recorded at Le Spectrum in Montreal. The album was deleted from the Warner Bros catalogue in 2003.\n\nIn an interview with Spin magazine in January 2008, Bob Mould revealed that he has never heard this album.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;New Day Rising&quot; (Mould/Hart/Norton) (Washington 10/21/87)\n   2. &quot;Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill&quot; (Hart) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n   3. &quot;Standing in the Rain&quot; (Mould) (Toronto 10/13/87)\n   4. &quot;Back from Somewhere&quot; (Hart) (Washington 10/20/87)\n   5. &quot;Ice Cold Ice&quot; (Mould) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n   6. &quot;Everytime&quot; (Norton) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n   7. &quot;Friend, You've Got to Fall&quot; (Mould) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n   8. &quot;She Floated Away&quot; (Hart) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n   9. &quot;From the Gut&quot; (Mould/Norton) (Providence 10/16/87)\n  10. &quot;Target&quot; (Mould) (Washington 10/20/87)\n  11. &quot;It's Not Funny Anymore&quot; (Hart) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n  12. &quot;Hardly Getting Over It&quot; (Mould) (Toronto 10/13/87)\n  13. &quot;Terms of Psychic Warfare&quot; (Hart) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n  14. &quot;Powerline&quot; (Mould) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n  15. &quot;Books About UFOs&quot; (Hart) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n  16. &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot; (Mould) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n  17. &quot;Keep Hanging On&quot; (Hart) (New York City 10/17/87)\n  18. &quot;Celebrated Summer&quot; (Mould) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n  19. &quot;Now That You Know Me&quot; (Hart) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n  20. &quot;Ain't No Water in The Well&quot; (Mould) (Toronto 10/13/87)\n  21. &quot;What's Going On&quot; (Hart) (New Haven 10/18/87)\n  22. &quot;Data Control&quot; (Hart) (Providence 10/16/87)\n  23. &quot;In a Free Land&quot; (Mould) (Toronto 10/13/87)\n  24. &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; (Ramones) (Montreal 10/14/87)\n\n\nShare The Rare.\nSEED OR BLEED!\n-Olde Punks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d00a3fc5322d573ce5521238c970650d7e5d44e","amp;dn":"Husker+Du+-+The+Living+End+%281994%29+%28olde_punks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d00a3fc5322d573ce5521238c970650d7e5d44e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,0,163,252,83,34,213,115,206,85,33,35,140,151,6,80,215,229,212,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
