This reference presents the work from contributors from various fields, of various ages and from different countries, creating a valuable collection of research that will advance the fundamental and innovative techniques of nanosystems and their interactions. The authors cover self-assembly, self-regenerating, storage, and directional properties of intelligent materials. It helps readers respond to the challenges in this field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e71fd2f84abc826a374709bff8a578f09c029f9","amp;dn":"Quantum+Nanosystems+-+Structure%2C+Properties%2C+and+Interactions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e71fd2f84abc826a374709bff8a578f09c029f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,113,253,47,132,171,200,38,163,116,112,155,255,138,87,143,9,192,41,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
