His chosen surname, which he used from 1925, means &quot;evil/wrong side&quot; and is a play on Napoleon's family name &quot;Bonaparte&quot; which means, in Italian, &quot;good side&quot;.\n\nHis remarkable knowledge of Europe and its leaders is based upon his experience as a correspondent and in the Italian diplomatic service. In 1941 he was sent to cover the Eastern Front as a correspondent for Corriere della Sera. The articles he sent back from the Ukrainian Fronts, many of which were suppressed, were collected in 1943 and brought out under the title Il Volga nasce in Europa (&quot;The Volga Rises in Europe&quot;). Also, this experience provided the basis for his two most famous books, Kaputt (1944) and The Skin (1949).\n\nKaputt, his novelistic account of the war, surreptitiously written, presents the conflict from the point of view of those doomed to lose it. Malaparte's account is marked by lyrical observations, as when he encounters a detachment of Wehrmacht soldiers fleeing a Ukrainian battlefield:\n\nWhen Germans become afraid, when that mysterious German fear begins to creep into their bones, they always arouse a special horror and pity. Their appearance is miserable, their cruelty sad, their courage silent and hopeless.\n\nAs the Italian reporter, in his powerful Kaputt WWII testimony, Malaparte described an interview with Pavelic:\n\nWhile he spoke, I gazed at a wicker basket on the Poglavnik's desk. The lid was raised and the basket seemed to be filled with mussels, or shelled oysters, as they are occasionally displayed in the windows of Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly in London. Casertano looked at me and winked, &quot;Would you like a nice oyster stew?&quot;\n\n&quot;Are they Dalmatian oysters?&quot; I asked the Poglavnik.\n\nAnte Pavelic removed the lid from the basket and revealed the mussels, that slimy and jelly-like mass, and he said smiling, with that tired good-natured smile of his, &quot;It is a present from my loyal Ustashis. Forty pounds of human eyes.&quot;\nMilan Kundera's view of the Kaputt is summarized in his essay The Tragedy of Central Europe:\n\n&quot;It is strange, yes, but understandable: for this reportage is something other than reportage; it is a literary work whose aesthetic intention is so strong, so apparent, that the sensitive reader automatically excludes it from the context of accounts brought to bear by historians, journalists, political analysts, memoirists.&quot;\n\nAccording to D. Moore's editorial note, in The Skin:\n\nMalaparte extends the great fresco of European society he began in Kaputt. There the scene was Eastern Europe, here it is Italy during the years from 1943 to 1945; instead of Germans, the invaders are the American armed forces. In all the literature that derives from the Second World War, there is no other book that so brilliantly or so woundingly present triumphant American innocence against the background of the European experience of destruction and moral collapse.\n\n\n\nThe torrent contains following books in ePUB format:\n\n* Kaputt (1944)\n\n* The Skin (1949) \n\n* The Volga Rises in Europe (1943)\n\n\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzio_Malaparte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzio_Malaparte&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/01/bad-bone-john-gray-italian-fascist-curzio-malapartes-lost-masterpiece&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/01/bad-bone-john-gray-italian-fascist-curzio-malapartes-lost-masterpiece&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/28/adam-thirlwell-malaparte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/28/adam-thirlwell-malaparte&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c672245e0c41154251907c4447b8c7d5423c44","amp;dn":"Curzio+Malaparte+-+Italian+Author+%28+3+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4c672245e0c41154251907c4447b8c7d5423c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,198,114,36,94,12,65,21,66,81,144,124,68,71,184,199,213,66,60,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
