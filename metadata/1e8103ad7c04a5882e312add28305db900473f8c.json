This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey recounts the scare of deafness that visited Dennis Elliot, drummer for Foreigner. But he uses the same word-for-word script from the November 10, 1979 show (currently available).\n\nSomeone writes in to ask, &quot;What recording act has had the most number 1 albums in a row?&quot; It was a band whose eight number 1 album streak was ended by their own success.\n\n&quot;We Are The World&quot; by USA For Africa debuts on the hot 100 all the way up at number 21.\n\nCasey tells of the achievements of Robert &quot;Bumps&quot; Blackwell (5/23/1918 to 5/9/1985) who produced Little Richard's hit &quot;Tutti Fruttie&quot; and later went on to produce Sam Cook.\n\nCasey says in the rock era, only ten songs have ever failed to make the top 40 in their first release, but then make the top 10 on a second release (4 in the 80's). One of them is in this countdown.\n\nThere are back to back Tinas at numbers 7 (&quot;Private Dancer&quot; by Miss Turner) and 6 (&quot;Lover Girl&quot; by Miss Marie).\n\nI had to do some editing at the beginning of number 26 (&quot;I Want To Know What Love Is&quot; by Foreigner) and on number 4 (&quot;The Heat Is On&quot; by Glenn Frey). The radio station CD must gave skipped so I tried to fill in the missing pieces with parts from another broadcast.\n\n40: Second Nature - Dan Hartman\n39: Radioactive - The Firm\n38: Lucky - Greg Kihn\n37: That Was Yesterday - Foreigner\n36: (Don't You) Forget About Me - Simple Minds\n35: One Night In Bangkok - Murray Head\n34: Why Can't I Have You - The Cars\n33: Easy Lover - Philip Bailey and Phil Collins\n32: This Is Not American - David Bowie and The Pat Metheny Group\n31: Turn Up The Radio - Autograph\n30: Along Comes A Woman - Chicago\n29: All She Wants To Do Is Dance - Don Henley\n28: Naughty Naughty - John Parr\nLDD: Times Of Your Life - Paul Anka\n27: Neutron Dance - The Pointer Sisters\n26: I Want To Know What Love Is - Foreigner\n25: Take Me With U - Prince &amp; The Revolution\n24: Rhythm Of The Night - DeBarge\n23: Misled - Kool &amp; The Gang\n22: Obsession - Animotion\n21: We Are The World - USA For Africa\n20: Crazy For You - Madonna\n19: Missing You - Diana Ross\n18: Keeping The Faith - Billy Joel\n17: I'm On Fire - Bruce Springsteen\n16: Save A Prayer (Live Version) - Duran Duran\n15: Nightshift - The Commodores\n14: Somebody - Bryan Adams\n13: Just Another Night - Mick Jagger\n12: Careless Whisper - Wham\n11: California Girls - David Lee Roth\n10: Relax - Frankie Goes To Hollywood\n9: Only The Young - Journey\n8: High On You - Survivor\n7: Private Dancer - Tina Turner\n6: Lovergirl - Tina Marie\n5: Too Late For Goodbyes - Julian Lennon\n4: The Heat Is On - Glenn Frey\nLDD: Leader Of The Band - Dan Fogelberg\n3: One More Night - Phil Collins\n2: Material Girl - Madonna\n1: Can't Fight This Feeling - REO Speedwagon\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8103ad7c04a5882e312add28305db900473f8c","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1985_March_23rd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8103ad7c04a5882e312add28305db900473f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,129,3,173,124,4,165,136,46,49,42,221,40,48,93,185,0,71,63,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
