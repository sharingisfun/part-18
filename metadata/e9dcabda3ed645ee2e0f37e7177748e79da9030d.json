Recorded on 31 May 1987 in Vienna in the Great Hall of the Wiener Musikverein. This is certainly one of the finest concerts he gave during his last tour, with outstanding highlights being the Schumann Kinderszenen and Chopin's Heroic Polonaise. Sound quality is rather amazing, projecting the famous Horowitz sonorities to an astounding degree.\n\n[MPEG4, 640x432; duration 1h29]\n\nProgramme:\n\nMozart: Rondo in D major, K.485\nMozart: Sonata in B-flat major, K.333\nSchubert: Impromptu in G-flat major, Op.90 No.3\nLiszt: SoirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e de Vienne No.6 (after Schubert)\n- Intermission -\nSchumann: Kinderszenen, Op.15\nChopin: Mazurka in B minor, Op.33 No.4\nChopin: Polonaise in A-flat major, Op.53\n- Encores: -\nLiszt: Consolation No.3 in D-flat major\nSchubert: Moment Musical in F minor, Op.94 No.3\nMoszkowski: Etincelles, Op.36 No.6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9dcabda3ed645ee2e0f37e7177748e79da9030d","amp;dn":"Horowitz+Live+in+Vienna+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9dcabda3ed645ee2e0f37e7177748e79da9030d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,220,171,218,62,214,69,238,46,15,55,231,23,119,72,231,157,169,3,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
