The good quality images leap out of the pages at you and are generally in large format. Having acquired many Victorian era photo books in the last 30 years, a lot of the images have been duplicated in other publications through the passage of time but this does not detract from a delightful book, published nearly forty years years ago with an informative text accompanying it.\n\nP.
