What must we do to recover possession of our true selves? By way of an answer, Merton discusses how we have become strangers to ourselves by our dependence on outward identity and success, while our real need is for a concern with the image of God in ourselves. At a time of retrieval of our religious traditions, Merton's voice is both intelligent and spiritually compelling.Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk, is perhaps the foremost spiritual thinker of the twentieth century. His diaries, social commentary, and spiritual writings continue to be widely read after his untimely death in 1968.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;To those who shrink from the usual sort of 'spiritual reading,' Thomas Merton's book may be recommended. They will be confronted by a vigorous, questioning mind that again and again anticipates an objection, a doubt, even a disgust.&quot; - The Times Literary Supplement\n\nAbout the Author\n\nThomas Merton (1915-1968) is one of the foremost spiritual thinkers of the twentieth century. Though he lived a mostly solitary existence as a Trappist monk, he had a dynamic impact on world affairs through his writing. An outspoken proponent of the antiwar and civil rights movements, he was both hailed as a prophet and castigated for his social criticism. He was also unique among religious leaders in his embrace of Eastern mysticism, positing it as complementary to the Western sacred tradition. Merton is the author of over forty books of poetry, essays, and religious writing, including Mystics and Zen Masters, and The Seven Story Mountain, for which he is best known. His work continues to be widely read to this day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21f4ddbbfa02492c41c657729ca2ddc8c345537","amp;dn":"Thomas+Merton+-+The+New+Man+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21f4ddbbfa02492c41c657729ca2ddc8c345537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,31,77,219,191,160,36,146,196,28,101,119,41,202,45,220,140,52,85,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
