For those who haven't Voltaire makes some very good goth-folk-rock like music with offten funny lyrics. I've enjoyed his music since I've found out about it and didn't see a torrent of his music so I thought I would make one. This is also my first torrent upload so I hope Ive done everything right....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49668a4ae86f34099c66165aaa8783d36580e879","amp;dn":"Voltaire+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49668a4ae86f34099c66165aaa8783d36580e879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,102,138,74,232,111,52,9,156,102,22,90,170,135,131,211,101,128,232,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
