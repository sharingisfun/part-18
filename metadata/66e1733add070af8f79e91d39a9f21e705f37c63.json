Fixed memory leaks. Implemented memory manager. New version has 4-5 times lowered memory consumption comparing to older releases, some cases show difference up to 10 times.\r\n    PDF files are loaded 4-5 times faster. Results are spectacular on bigger files. Of course, difference on small files between 0.3 seconds and 0.05 seconds canâ€™t be noted, but large files for thousand and more pages are loaded significantly faster. Currently it takes less than 1 second to open big documents whereas it was 3-4 seconds earlier.\r\n    Windows and Linux versions have new Â«Open documents as new tabs in the same windowÂ» which allows to open newly opened documents in same window. Mac version had this function earlier since it was regulated by OS X settings.\r\n    Added â€œPaste to Multiple Pagesâ€ function. It allows to insert clipboard content to all or selected pages. Choose â€œPaste to Multiple Pagesâ€ item in â€œEdit Menuâ€ to use it. This will open a dialogue window which has all the pages except for current selected by default. Function is designed for insertion of watermarks, headers and any other objects, which have to be created on multiple pages. In order to do this itâ€™s enough to create sample at one page, copy it to the clipboard and then insert it to the selected pages.\r\n    Improved PDF signing with digital signature. Added ability to set custom text on the signature which will be displayed after signing.\r\n    Fixed some issues on digital signature validation.\r\n    Added Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translations.\r\n    Fixed issue with hot keys in some localization.\r\n    Added â€œDocument Actionsâ€ function, which allows to call JavaScript events on some actions like saving, closing or printing the document. These events enable developers to change PDF before and after actions. Some developers use these events to insert watermark to the printed document, while the file itself wanâ€™t have the watermark.\r\n    Added â€œDocument JavaScriptâ€ function, which provided ability to create and edit scripts working when PDF document is opened.\r\n    Added â€œRotateâ€ function, which enables user to rotate objects by any angle. It is controlled in â€œObject Inspectorâ€ in â€œGeometryâ€ section.\r\n    Fixed issues with Â«Open/execute a FileÂ» event. Now it also uses relative, not absolute path to file.\r\n    Improved uniting different text objects into words and sentences.\r\n    Added Â«Open with Master PDF Editor 3Â» item to Windowsâ€™ Explorer context menu.\r\n    Improved â€œAlign Objectsâ€ function. New version aligns objects by the page edge if multiple objects are selected, but thereâ€™s no current object. If current object is selected, then object will be aligned along it.\r\n    Fixed issue with Ctrl key sticking, which appeared at some Linux distros. Mostly important for Linux Mint.\r\n    Improved and redesigned work with comments. Now moving comments and changing their properties is possible without switching to edit\r\n    mode.\r\n    Fixed some issues with Windows virtual printer.\r\n    Improved print system. Added â€œActual sizeâ€ option in print preview window.\r\n    Improved text selection in Hand Tool mode.\r\n    Fixed some issues with PDF forms filling.\r\n    Fixed some issues with objects editing.\r\n    Fixed issue with default font used for text insertion or editing.\r\n    Fixed some other minor issues.\r\n    Added several new function for JavaScript and application interface interaction.\r\n    Added some other minor abilities.\r\n\r\nAll the functions added to Master PDF Editor are completely compatible with PDF 1.7 standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n###################################################################################\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-HomePage- https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e1733add070af8f79e91d39a9f21e705f37c63","amp;dn":"Master+PDF+Editor+3.6.0+Multilingual%5BThePiratebay%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e1733add070af8f79e91d39a9f21e705f37c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,225,115,58,221,7,10,248,247,158,145,211,154,159,33,231,5,243,124,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
