However, it soon became apparent that quaaludes were highly addictive and had a strong potential for recreational abuse. Throughout the 1960s and '70s, quaaludes were extremely popular due to their ability to produce a drunk-like state without a hangover. After years of scientific research revealed the harmful short- and long-term effects of using quaaludes, the drugs were made illegal and pulled from the market in most countries. However, quaaludes continue to be abused in many developing nations. &quot;Quaaludes&quot; covers the history of the drugs, the physical and psychological effects, their impact on the brain, their dangers of use and abuse, the portrayal of quaaludes in the media, and treatments for quaalude addiction. Chapters of this title include: An Overview of Depressant Drugs; What Are Quaaludes?; Past and Present Use of Quaaludes; The Neuroscience of Quaalude Use; The Physical and Psychological Effects of Quaaludes; Quaaludes in the Popular Media; and, Problems Associated with the Use of Quaaludes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bbd94b706b0d6da7d38b20297abfe9c3a1d6833","amp;dn":"Drugs+-+The+Straight+Facts+-+Quaaludes+%282008%29+%2897p%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bbd94b706b0d6da7d38b20297abfe9c3a1d6833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,189,148,183,6,176,214,218,125,56,178,2,151,171,254,156,58,29,104,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
