He is best known as one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called &quot;the Younger&quot; to distinguish him from his father, Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcecbee7c8aac9c5ab4e96c6ef5d50232f4bc694","amp;dn":"Hans+Holbein+the+Younger+%281497-1543%29+%28Art+paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcecbee7c8aac9c5ab4e96c6ef5d50232f4bc694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,236,190,231,200,170,201,197,171,78,150,198,239,93,80,35,47,75,198,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
