Which is a shame, because it&amp;#039;s one of the best strategy games ever, with cool spellcasting system inspired by Magic: The Gathering card game, RPG-style heroes, and Civilization-style building interface. Too bad the patch was needed for the game to reach its full potential. Arguably the best fantasy strategy game ever made, Master of Magic is, in its most recent incarnation, a must-have for all strategy gamers. Two thumbs up!&quot;\n\nThis is the Home of the Underdogs download, fully patched to version 1.31 to be fully playable. \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f398d3cf16539365f6cb493fb537e067dbb97a","amp;dn":"Master+of+Magic+%28patched+1.31%29+1993+Classic+4X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f398d3cf16539365f6cb493fb537e067dbb97a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,243,152,211,207,22,83,147,101,246,203,73,63,181,55,224,103,219,185,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
