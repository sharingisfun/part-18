Aaker, &quot;Brand Relevance: Making Competitors Irrelevant&quot;\nEnglish | 2011 | ISBN: 0470613580 | PDF | 400 pages | 4,2 MB\n\nBranding guru Aaker shows how to eliminate the competition and become the lead brand in your market\nThis ground-breaking book defines the concept of brand relevance using dozens of case studies-Prius, Whole Foods, Westin, iPad and more-and explains how brand relevance drives market dynamics, which generates opportunities for your brand and threats for the competition.\n\nAaker reveals how these companies have made other brands in their categories irrelevant. Key points: When managing a new category of product, treat it as if it were a brand; By failing to produce what customers want or losing momentum and visibility, your brand becomes irrelevant; and create barriers to competitors by supporting innovation at every level of the organization.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfb09beb26c68690c4c042ff73a15f02c4b9d913","amp;dn":"Brand+Relevance%3A+Making+Competitors+Irrelevant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfb09beb26c68690c4c042ff73a15f02c4b9d913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,176,155,235,38,198,134,144,196,192,66,255,115,161,95,2,196,185,217,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
