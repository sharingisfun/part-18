This question has undoubtedly been asked, in one form or another, since man has had the ability to communicate. . . Thousands of volumes have been written on the subject of a god, and the vast majority have answered the questions with a resounding 'Yes!' &quot;\n\n&quot;You are about to read a minority viewpoint.&quot;\n\nWith this intriguing introduction, George H. Smith sets out to demolish what he considers the most widespread and destructive of all the myths devised by man - the concept of a supreme being. With painstaking scholarship and rigorous arguments, Mr. Smith examines, dissects, and refutes the myriad &quot;proofs&quot; offered by theists - the defenses of sophisticated, professional theologians, as well as the average religious layman. He explores the historical and psychological havoc wrought by religion in general - and concludes that religious belief cannot have any place in the life of modern, rational man.\n\n&quot;It is not my purpose to convert people to atheism . . . (but to) demonstrate that the belief in God is irrational to the point of absurdity. If a person wishes to continue believing in a god, that is his prerogative, but he can no longer excuse his belief in the name of reason and moral necessity.&quot;\n\n355 pages\nSeries: The Skeptic's Bookshelf\nPublisher: Prometheus Books\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 087975124X\nISBN-13: 978-0879751241","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ebbe72896a1ae4aa1bd25241a2b05736ecd42d9","amp;dn":"Atheism%3A+The+Case+Against+God+%282003%29+by+George+H.+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ebbe72896a1ae4aa1bd25241a2b05736ecd42d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,187,231,40,150,161,174,74,161,189,37,36,26,43,5,115,110,205,66,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
