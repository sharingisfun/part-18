The Fleetwoods' forte was ballads -- beginning with their 1959 debut single, &quot;Come Softly to Me,&quot; the group racked up a number of hits over the next three years, and nearly all of them were ballads. The group broke up in 1963, but their songs -- particularly &quot;Come Softly to Me&quot; -- became pop-rock classics of the pre-British Invasion era. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifuxqe5ldje~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifuxqe5ldje~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nCEMA Special Markets' Greatest Hits is an excellent budget-priced collection of the Fleetwoods' most popular songs that may be all some casual fans need. While Rhino's The Best of the Fleetwoods boasts a comprehensive 18 songs, this ten-track collection has all but one (&quot;The Last to Know&quot;) of their charting pop hits. Which means, of course, that such hits as &quot;Come Softly to Me,&quot; &quot;Graduation's Here,&quot; &quot;Mr. Blue,&quot; &quot;You Mean Everything to Me,&quot; &quot;Runaround,&quot; &quot;Tragedy,&quot; &quot;(He's) The Great Imposter&quot; and &quot;Goodnight My Love&quot; are here, and for many listeners, that makes this Greatest Hits all the Fleetwoods they'll need.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hbfwxqyjldje&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hbfwxqyjldje&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
