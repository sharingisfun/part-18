Shotts Jr. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://linuxcommand.org/images/320_7594184.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://linuxcommand.org/images/320_7594184.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabout book :-\n\nYou've experienced the shiny, point-and-click surface of your Linux computerÃ¢â‚¬â€now dive below and explore its depths with the power of the command line.\n\nThe Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you'll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more.\n\nIn addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore.\n\nAs you make your way through the book's short, easily-digestible chapters, you'll learn how to:\n\nCreate and delete files, directories, and symlinks\nAdminister your system, including networking, package installation, and process management\nUse standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines\nEdit files with Vi, the world's most popular text editor\nWrite shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks\nSlice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed\nOnce you overcome your initial &quot;shell shock,&quot; you'll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don't be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust.\n \nAbout the Author :-\nWilliam E. Shotts, Jr. has been a software professional and avid Linux user for more than 15 years.
