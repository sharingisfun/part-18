Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was 16, and I sent him a really short letter saying, Ã¢â‚¬ËœHey, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s me. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m at. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m playing guitar.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I got a phone call three days later,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Devon. Soon after that phone call, the two met in the parking lot at The Fox Theater in St. Louis during a tour stop for the elder Allman.\n\nGrowing up with his mom, Devon was listening to anything on the radio he could find. Often it was the Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I can remember listening to music at the age of four or five. Something would come on the radio and I would always ask my mom who it was. She would say Ã¢â‚¬ËœThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s John LennonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœthatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Styx.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ One time Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight RiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ came on, and I asked her Ã¢â‚¬ËœMom whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and she said Ã¢â‚¬ËœThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your dad.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis young Allman did not come on the music scene riding the coattails of a famous parent. Allman has been living his own musical life for decades. After playing in local bands and working in Guitar Center in St. Louis, Allman formed Honeytribe in 1999. One part blues, one part rock, and one part jam, Honeytribe was named the 1999 Jam Band of the Year in St. Louis.\n\nDevon and Honeytribe toured for two years then took a break for a few years allowing Devon to actively parent his son to later reform in 2005. At the same time, he toured in Europe with Javier Vargas, a Spanish blues rocker. Devon and Honeytribe continued to tour in support of his 2010 release Space Age Blues.\n\nThen, in 2011, his musical fate changed.\n\nRoyal Southern Brotherhood was formed during JazzFest in New Orleans. This unique quintet combines the vocal and musical talents of Devon, Mike Zito, and the legendary Cyril Neville with the veteran rhythm section of Charlie Wooton and Yonrico Scott. Their debut self-titled release in 2012 caught fire the moment it hit the streets simultaneously catapulting them as major new attraction on the music scene. Their mixed sounds of funk, blues, rock and jazz proved to be a force to be reckoned with. RSB tours non-stop performing all over the world, including Australia, at festivals and various venues. As Devon quips, Ã¢â‚¬Å“wherever there is electricity and potato chips.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Their second studio release, heartsoulblood, was released in June 2014 to another round of rave reviews.\n\nBut probably the crowning moment of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career thus far, was this past May, in Memphis, TN, where they picked up a Blues Award for their live DVD/CD, Songs From The Road.\n\nAfter touring the world as a fiery guitarist and soulful vocalist in Royal Southern Brotherhood, Devon is still committed to performing dates with his own band, with a renewed intensity.\n\nHis own 2013 Ruf Records debut, Turquoise, came a few months after the RSBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut, giving him a slew of accolades from USA Today, calling it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“...well-crafted, more reflective than fiery, and soulful.Ã¢â‚¬Å“, to Relix proclaiming him as such, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an elegant, soulful singer.Ã¢â‚¬Å“\n\nAnd as he told Billboard magazine, Devon predicted, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦this one's going to be really heavy on guitar and come out and punch you in the teeth.&quot;\n\nA little more than a year later, Ragged &amp; Dirty is DevonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ticket to the big show. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have to say that playing with Royal took my career to a new level. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s given me more confidence and a new found love for the music. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m delighted that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a new shot of fire in my music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOne can never leave a name as famous as Ã¢â‚¬Å“AllmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ very far behind. There are traces of his father in his soulful voice and his uncle Duane in his innovative guitar playing. According to Devon, the name both helps and hurts. There will always be fans that come to see him out of curiosity, Ã¢â‚¬Å“But they leave having a respect for the fact that I am my own entity.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The hurt factor for me is to not get caught up thinking about the impact that my dad and uncle (Duane) had on this genre of music. That could make me go completely insane. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dwell on that. Focusing on that interferes with path and my art. I still want it to be essentially feel-based. The best thing for me to do is to concentrate on being the best musician I can be regardless of who my family is.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThus as one Allman institution (The Allman Brothers Band) has Ã¢â‚¬Å“retired,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Devon Allman is poised to grow his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical legacy.\n\nFor Ragged &amp; Dirty, Devon left his southern comfort zone, hired a crack Chicago band, and enlisted the producing and writing talents of Grammy winning producer Tom Hambridge (Buddy Guy, George Thorogood, Johnny Winter, James Cotton, and Joe Louis Walker).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done all my records in the south. I decided it was time to go to the electric blues mecca (Chicago), tap into that vibe and surround myself with cats who live and breathe it. Besides producing, Tom custom wrote some songs for this record that really aligned with my path.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThough Hambridge wrote four tunes and Devon picked three to cover, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his original tunes that speak to his artistic journey. Ã¢â‚¬Å“RSB has been such a deep, rich, globe-trotting experience that it definitely changes your life and gives you new perspective. Anytime youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re involved in something to that degree, it will show up in your art. I think the experience has given me more depth as a writer. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m more willing to let the groove take over and not force things vocally.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTo hear how a groove takes over, check out the spontaneity of his Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight Lake Michigan.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ DevonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark and ominous guitar howls push the nine-minute instrumental with a hoodoo aura. As the tension builds, the song adds Marty SammonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keyboards and Tom HambridgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s percussion in a swirl of primal rhythms.\n\nTo hear DevonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal range, listen to the CD closer, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leave The City.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With only Hambridge keepinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the sparse beat, Devon strips down and shows off his pleading, Allman-esque voice and stirring resonator guitar in this move to country blues simplicity.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I can handle echoes. People say they hear echoes of my dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul in my voice, but that I have a definitive sound. My dad says I remind him of Duane, although IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never played slide in my life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBut there is so much more to this record amid those genetic touches. Luther AllisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ragged &amp; DirtyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a funk meets blues that provides DevonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hot-shot Chicago studio band of bassist Felton Crews (Charlie Musselwhite and others), guitarist Giles Corey (Billy Branch), and keyboard ace Marty Sammon (Buddy Guy) along with NashvilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hambridge on drums room to show-off. AllmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“LeavinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides the band the opportunity to play with a subdued delicacy, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back To YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ builds from DevonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expressive solo over SammonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s B-3 foundation into a blistering slow blues ballad. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an expressive side to Devon as he and Wendy Moten handle the SpinnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be Around.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And DevonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover of Otis TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haunting Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ten Million SlavesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ commands our attention to bear witness to our historic injustices.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Whether that seeking is for truth, love, inclusion, acceptance, or peace, we all have a soul thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longing for something. Longing colors our arts in a myriad of shades. The main thing is now that I really trust my vision for songs. I go with my gut instantly. The focus now is to always get to the essence of the song and the story itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to convey in the simplest way possible.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01.
