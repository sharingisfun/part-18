This book's central message is that the sustainable potential of bioenergy, which can be tapped all over the world, should be utilized provided that threats to sustainability are avoided. In particular, the use of bioenergy must not endanger food security or the goals of nature conservation and climate change mitigation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb6fb187ca6aabb00a6abc487b88bd107929cff","amp;dn":"Future+Bioenergy+and+Sustainable+Land+Use","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb6fb187ca6aabb00a6abc487b88bd107929cff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,182,251,24,124,166,170,187,0,166,171,196,135,184,139,209,7,146,156,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
