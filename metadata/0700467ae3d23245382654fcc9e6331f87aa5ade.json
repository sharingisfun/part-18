The supporting cast includes Beulah Bondi, Ward Bond, Marjorie Main and John Qualen. The picture was Wayne's first film in Technicolor and was based on the novel of the same name by Harold Bell Wright. The director was Henry Hathaway, who directed several other Wayne films including True Grit almost three decades later.\n\n    CAST:-\n    John Wayne as Young Matt\n    Betty Field as Sammy Lane\n    Harry Carey as Daniel Howitt\n    Beulah Bondi as Aunt Mollie\n    James Barton as Old Matt\n    Samuel S.

His obsession contributes to the hatred rampant in the mountains. However, the arrival of a stranger, Daniel Howitt, begins to positively affect the mountain people, who learn to shed their hatred under his gentle influence. Still, Matt does not quite trust Howitt.....\n\nDifferences from the novel\nWhile the novel interposed fiction with portrayals of actual persons residing in the Missouri Ozarks, in the early Branson area, the film departed markedly from the book's presentations. Old Matt, a patriarch, mill owner and influential person within the community, is presented in the film as a doddering fool, henpecked by his wife, Aunt Mollie. In the novel she's a nurturing, kindly, loyal wife and friend, but in this film she is a shrill, nasty moonshiner. The &quot;Shepherd&quot; of the title, a cultured, sympathetic visitor from Chicago who contributes positively to the society he's visiting, in this film is an aging gunfighter with a guarded past and, in total odds with the book, is here Young Matt's (John Wayne's) father, with a shootout perpetrated by &quot;Big John.&quot; Other characters differ as markedly from Wright's novel. Although a good representation of the Ozarks area several decades ago, a decent story in its own right, and good nostalgia, it probably represents as great a departure by a film, versus the novel it is based on, in all motion picture history.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 98 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 98 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0700467ae3d23245382654fcc9e6331f87aa5ade","amp;dn":"The+Shepherd+of+the+Hills+%281941%29+Western+-+Xvid+1cd+-+John+Wayne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0700467ae3d23245382654fcc9e6331f87aa5ade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,0,70,122,227,210,50,69,56,38,84,252,201,230,51,31,135,170,90,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
