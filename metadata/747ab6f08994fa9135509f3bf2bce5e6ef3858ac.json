The multifaceted artwork shows the artist's complete control of form and color - talents that are not normally thought to be present in the AS mind. In an accompanying chapter the editors discuss the psychological interest and implication of Peter's work, demonstrating that it provides a valuable insight into the talents and strengths that make up the autistic mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:747ab6f08994fa9135509f3bf2bce5e6ef3858ac","amp;dn":"The+Exact+Mind%3A+An+Artist+With+Asperger+Syndrome","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"747ab6f08994fa9135509f3bf2bce5e6ef3858ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,122,182,240,137,148,250,145,53,80,159,59,242,188,229,230,239,56,88,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
