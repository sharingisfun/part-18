We have introduced a new character to Qimo, her name is Illa, a cute and cuddly little polar bear. Illa is an Inuit word that means 'friend', and we know she'll find her way into the hearts of your kids. She also has her own wallpaper featuring the Arctic landscape at dusk, filled with hues of pink and purple with the aurora borealis shining in the sky. Choose from a variety of Qimo and Illa wallpapers to find the one that is just right for your child. If you are already running Ubuntu 10.04, there's no need to do a fresh install to get Qimo - now you can add the qimo-session package from the Universe repository.\n\nTorrent peer is powered by  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fatmaggots.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fatmaggots.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b7098313fa3ac3ce64f536a06279470d8ca8aa8","amp;dn":"Qimo+4+Kids+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b7098313fa3ac3ce64f536a06279470d8ca8aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,112,152,49,63,163,172,60,230,79,83,106,6,39,148,112,216,202,138,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
