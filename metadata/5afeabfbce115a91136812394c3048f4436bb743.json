Published by arxel tribe in 2001 and developed by wizard soft this RTS includes a good story in a heroic fantasy setting in lands where dinosaurs roam. It includes 4 campaigns, skirmish and editor. Cracks by famous teams and serial number included. Burn in a dvd, create a virtual drive using power iso, mount the image and install the game. Then use one of the cracks with its special process and play. Enjoy and don't forget to seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5afeabfbce115a91136812394c3048f4436bb743","amp;dn":"primitive+wars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5afeabfbce115a91136812394c3048f4436bb743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,254,171,251,206,17,90,145,19,104,18,57,76,48,72,244,67,107,183,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
