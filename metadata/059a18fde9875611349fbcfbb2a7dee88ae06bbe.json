In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero.\n\nHe is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book The Prophet, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture. Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.\n\nGibran was a great admirer of poet and writer Francis Marrash, whose works he had studied at al-Hikma school in Beirut. According to orientalist Shmuel Moreh, Gibran's own works echo Marrash's style, many of his ideas, and at times even the structure of some of his works; Suheil Bushrui and Joe Jenkins have mentioned Marrash's concept of universal love, in particular, in having left a &quot;profound impression&quot; on Gibran. The poetry of Gibran often uses formal language and spiritual terms; as one of his poems reveals: &quot;But let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.&quot; \n\nMany of Gibran's writings deal with Christianity, especially on the topic of spiritual love. But his mysticism is a convergence of several different influences: Christianity, Islam, Sufism, Judaism and theosophy. He wrote: &quot;You are my brother and I love you. I love you when you prostrate yourself in your mosque, and kneel in your church and pray in your synagogue. You and I are sons of one faithÃ¢â‚¬â€the Spirit.&quot;\n\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in ePUB format:\n\nA Tear and A Smile (1914)\n\nBroken Wings (1912)\n\nJesus, The Son of Man (1928)\n\nLazarus and his Beloved (Play, 1933)\n\nRebellious Spirits (1908)\n\nSand and Foam (1926)\n\nThe Earth Gods (1931)\n\nThe Forerunner (1920)\n\nThe Garden of The Prophet (1933)\n\nThe Madman (1918)\n\nThe Prophet (1923)\n\nThe Wanderer (1932)\n\n\n\nRead the following article, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:059a18fde9875611349fbcfbb2a7dee88ae06bbe","amp;dn":"Kahlil+Gibran+-+Lebanese+Author+%2812+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"059a18fde9875611349fbcfbb2a7dee88ae06bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,154,24,253,233,135,86,17,52,159,188,251,178,167,222,232,138,224,107,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
