The clean blank pages are waiting to be filled, perhaps with secret thoughts, perhaps with favorite family recipes or pasted up with photos, ticket stubs and cherished mementos. And what could be more appealing than to embellish these blank books with attractive covers of fabric and other decorations? \nCrafting Beautiful Journals and Albums shows readers how to beautify their ready-made blank books and plain photograph albums with a range of different materials, from tree bark and dried leaves to copper sheets and handmade papers. Once they've mastered these techniques, they'll move on to creating their own books from scratch using genuine bookbinding techniques. \n* Shows readers how to transform any plain journal into something special\n* More than 20 projects are presented with full color, step-by-step illustrations\n\nAbout the Author\nAnna Morgan specializes in designing and producing books, boxes and portfolios for working artists, international corporations and museums.
