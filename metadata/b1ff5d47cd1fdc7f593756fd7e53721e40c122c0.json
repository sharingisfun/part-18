Fortunately he did record a fair amount of trio albums through the years so there is plenty of evidence as to his unique style which was both modern and traditional at the same time. The Pianist has trio performances from 1966 and 1970 and finds Ellington shifting smoothly between styles and moods while always remaining himself. \n\nTracks 1-7 (Recorded in New York 18th July 1966)\nDuke Ellington - Piano\nJohn Lamb - Bass\nSam Woodyard - Drums\n\nTracks 8-10 (Recorded in Las Vegas 7th January 1970)\nDuke Ellington - Piano\nPaul Kondziela - Bass\nRufus Jones - Drums\n\n01.
