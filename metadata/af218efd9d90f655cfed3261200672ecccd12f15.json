To understand his influence on the Middle East is to understand the ongoing genocidal program against the Jews of Israel. Al-Husseini was a bridge figure in terms of transporting the Nazi genocide in Europe into the post-war Middle East. As the leader of Arab Palestine during the British Mandate period, al-Husseini introduced violence against moderate Arabs as well as against Jews. Al-Husseini met with Adolf Eichmann in Palestine in 1937 and subsequently went on the Nazi payroll as a Nazi agent. Al-Husseini played a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in instigating a pro-Nazi coup in Iraq in 1941 as he urged Nazis and pro-Nazi governments in Europe to transport Jews to death camps, trained pro-Nazi Bosnian brigades, and funneled Nazi loot into pro-war Arab countries.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Chuck Morse is a Boston area radio talk show host, a syndicated columnist who is regularly featured on World Net Daily and Newsmax.com, and host of cable TV show Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morse Code.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Morse is married to Barbara, a Boston attorney and is the father of a 4-year-old daughter.
