Abrams | 1964 | ISBN: N/A | English | 184 pages | PDF | 22 MB\n\n\nNeoclassicism is the name given to Western movements in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the &quot;classical&quot; art and culture of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. Neoclassicism was born in Rome in the mid-1700s, but its popularity spread all over Europe, as a generation of European art students finished their Grand Tour and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly-rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals. The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, latterly competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5536845fe9a42f4dad89ea6f5e12930207cae7d1","amp;dn":"Neo-Classicism+-+Style+and+Motif+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5536845fe9a42f4dad89ea6f5e12930207cae7d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,54,132,95,233,164,47,77,173,137,234,111,94,18,147,2,7,202,231,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
