Along with scoring films, producing easy listening records, and co-writing the hit tune &quot;Our Day Will Come,&quot; Garson released several electronic music LPs with themes like the Zodiac, the -Wizard of Oz, and plant growth stimulation. Black Mass/Lucifer (the cover art is ambiguous as to title) is Garson&amp;#039;s exploration of the dark arts, an all-instrumental soundtrack for a horror film that never existed. Garson conjures up a sinister, minor-key atmosphere on tracks with titles like &quot;Incubus,&quot; &quot;Witch Trial,&quot; and &quot;The Evil Eye&quot; often achieving a tone similar to the scores that Italian horror-rock band Goblin would record for Dario Argento films later in the decade. The technology available to Garson in 1971 was still being developed, and the record occasionally sounds dated, particularly when some very corny synthetic drums ruin the mood. There&amp;#039;s some evocative music on Black Mass/Lucifer, to be sure, but ultimately it&amp;#039;s just not as wild of a recording as legend has painted, perfectly rendered for a psychedelic Halloween party but hardly strong enough to raise evil spirits on its own. \n\nThere&amp;#039;s a bit of distortion on the tracks, but not too horrible. Fun to hear this after MANY years, for me anyway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b804ee780ac21dd089a653961926167badd133dd","amp;dn":"Mort+Garson+-+Black+Mass+Lucifer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b804ee780ac21dd089a653961926167badd133dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,4,238,120,10,194,29,208,137,166,83,150,25,38,22,123,173,209,51,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
