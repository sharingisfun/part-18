But Diantha has a bigger goal, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not afraid of plunging into adventure to achieve it. When daring, dashing Wyn Yale rescues her, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the man she needs.\n\nAs an agent for the secret Falcon Club, Wyn knows his duty, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about to admit heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hero of any sort. He has a plan, too: steal a prized horse, murder an evil duke, avenge an innocent girl, and probably get hanged for itÃ¢â‚¬â€in that order. Wyn canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford to be distracted by a pretty face, even one with delectable dimples and kissable lips. But how can a country miss and a hardened spy solve their problems when they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep their hands off each other?\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
