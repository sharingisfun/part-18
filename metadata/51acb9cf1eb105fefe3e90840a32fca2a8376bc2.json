They drive vehicles, use machinery, and\nlive in amazing castles and forts. But make no mistake about it: these are animals,\nwith claws, fangs, tails, and sometimes wings. And now they are engaged in a full\nscale conflict. Once a pristine, natural paradise, the land of CHIMA has become a\nbattle ground for the animal tribes. Best friends are now worst enemies. Weaponry\npummels the once-sacred temples. Animalistic vehicles charge furiously at each other\nin jungle jousts. The animals fight for control of a natural resource called CHI, a\npower that is both a source of life and holds the potential for destruction. Only a\nfew brave heroes in CHIMA understand the true nature of CHI and its importance.\nTheir stories, and the stories of those who seek to conquer the CHI, are known as...\nTHE LEGENDS OF CHIMA.\n\nProduced by M2Film and The LEGO Group.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/1791/s4nr.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/1791/s4nr.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhen Cragger and his Croc troops attempt to steal back some of the CHI the Wolves\nhave stolen from the other tribes, they are captured and taken prisoner - but Laval\nis determined to help is old friend Cragger and attempts a daring rescue.\n\nLEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S01E13.Crocodile.Tears.720p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN\n\nFormat: Matroska Video File (MKV)\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 23.976fps\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:22:04\nFile size: 644 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51acb9cf1eb105fefe3e90840a32fca2a8376bc2","amp;dn":"LEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S01E13.720p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51acb9cf1eb105fefe3e90840a32fca2a8376bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,172,185,207,30,177,5,254,254,62,144,132,10,50,252,162,168,55,107,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
