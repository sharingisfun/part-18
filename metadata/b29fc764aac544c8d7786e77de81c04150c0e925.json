The source used was stro and it had tons of issues like interlace (still there), poor resolution, pixalation, some camera movement and so on and so on :lol: It still has its issues. I may give it another shot, but maybe not. The audio on the other hand isnt to bad. I did what I could with it or actually felt like doing to it, as Im hoping like the rest of yall we get a new video source. Just putting out there cause its available. :P\n\ncredit KiNGDOM &amp; BLaZE BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b29fc764aac544c8d7786e77de81c04150c0e925","amp;dn":"The+Last+Airbender+CAM+READ+NFO+XViD-KiNGDOM+%28Kingdom-Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b29fc764aac544c8d7786e77de81c04150c0e925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,159,199,100,170,197,68,200,215,120,110,119,222,129,192,65,80,192,233,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
