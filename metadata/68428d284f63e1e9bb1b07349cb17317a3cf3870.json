It marked Sinatra's return to #1 on the pop album charts in the mid-1960's, and consolidated the comeback he started in 1966. Combining pop hits with show tunes and standards, the album creates a balance between big band and pop instrumentation. The single &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; also reached #1 on the pop single charts, while &quot;Summer Wind&quot; would slowly become a classic, used for television commercials and mood-setting entrances by the 2000's.\n\nAt the Grammy Awards of 1967 Sinatra garnered two Grammys for his efforts on this album, including the Record of the Year for the title track, as well as Best Male Vocal Performance for the same song. (He also won a further Grammy that same year, the Album of the Year for A Man and His Music). Ernie Freeman's arrangement of the title track won him the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist or Instrumentalist.\n\nThis is the final album Sinatra performed with long-time arranger/conductor Nelson Riddle and his orchestra.\n\nStrangers in the Night has been certified platinum for one million copies sold in the US. It is the only &quot;regular&quot; Sinatra album to achieve this mark (the others to do so have been greatest hits/compilation albums, Christmas albums, or the end-of-career &quot;Duets&quot; albums).\n\nAlso, this album has been reissued as a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; on January 26, 2010. Including three bonus tracks ...two recorded tracks of &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; and &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot; performed at the Budokan Hall from 1985, and an alternate take of &quot;Yes Sir, That's My Baby&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68428d284f63e1e9bb1b07349cb17317a3cf3870","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+Strangers+in+the+night+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68428d284f63e1e9bb1b07349cb17317a3cf3870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,66,141,40,79,99,225,233,187,27,7,52,156,177,115,23,163,207,56,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
