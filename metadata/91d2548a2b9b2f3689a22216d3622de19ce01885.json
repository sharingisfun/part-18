It offers a balanced perspective that reflects the needs of practitioners, including an emphasis on applications within discussions on theoretical issues. The book include information on finite precision issues as well as discussion of specific algorithms where algorithmic techniques are of special importance, including graph drawing, robotics, forming a VLSI chip, vision and image processing, data compression, and cryptography. It also presents advanced topics in combinatorial optimization and parallel/distributed computing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91d2548a2b9b2f3689a22216d3622de19ce01885","amp;dn":"Algorithms+and+Theory+of+Computation+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91d2548a2b9b2f3689a22216d3622de19ce01885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,210,84,138,43,155,47,54,137,162,34,22,211,98,45,225,156,224,24,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
