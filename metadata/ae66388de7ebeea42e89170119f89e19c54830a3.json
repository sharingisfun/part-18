Margaret Thatcher Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Iron Lady is the first major documentary to look back on the development and impact of this remarkable woman, whom commentators of both the political left and right agree changed the face of 20th Century politics forever. Featuring many excerpts from her powerful speeches and insightful contributions from her political supporters and detractors, a portrait emerges of a woman whose strength of conviction eventually became her weakness. This programme includes intimate footage of the Thatchers at home in Number 10, and unseen footage from her emotional and first major interview after her resignation as Prime Minister with Michael Brunson in 1992. Contributors include: Lord Heseltine, Lord Howe, ex-Conservative MP Gyles Brandreth, ITN political editor Michael Brunson, biographer Hugo Vickers, political correspondent Nicholas Owen, biographer Robert Lacey.\n\nGenre: Documentary\nIMDB rating: N/A\nDirected by: Alan Byron\nStarring: Margaret Thatcher, Michael Brunson\n\nRelease Name: Margaret.Thatcher.The.Iron.Lady.DOCU.2012.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT\nSize: 700MB\nVideo: XviD, 624 x 352 1084 kbps avg 25.000 fps\nAudio: English, MP3, 128kbps\nRuntime: 89 mins\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae66388de7ebeea42e89170119f89e19c54830a3","amp;dn":"Margaret+Thatcher+The+Iron+Lady+DOCU+2012+DVDRip+XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae66388de7ebeea42e89170119f89e19c54830a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,102,56,141,231,235,238,164,46,137,23,1,25,248,158,25,197,72,48,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
