He is hoping for a fresh start, but the locals greet their arrival with mixed reactions, from friendliness to open hostility. Bruce puts it down to them being outsiders, but when a tourist is killed while swimming, the real horror is unleashed. \n\nThere's something ravenous in the sea. Something that's coming ashore in search of prey. Now Bruce and Jack find themselves embroiled in a nightmare where humankind is no longer at the top of the food chain. First there was the Creature From The Black Lagoon... Then there was Jaws... Prepare yourself for Fangtooth.\n\nGenre: Horror","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5daed208f1709af93f9162e68a959dac03b3a6e","amp;dn":"Fangtooth+by+Shaun+Jeffrey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5daed208f1709af93f9162e68a959dac03b3a6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,218,237,32,143,23,9,175,147,249,22,46,104,169,89,218,192,59,58,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
