He's been lauded as the finest singer of his generation, he's written several songs that turned into modern standards, he sang with the Faces, who rivaled the Rolling Stones in their prime, he had massive commercial success. Stewart also saw his critical respect slip away during the '80s, when he recorded lightweight pop and although he did record some terrible albums -- and he would admit that freely -- Stewart will always be remembered as one of rock &amp; roll's best interpretive singers as well as an accomplished, innovative songwriter, creating a raw combination of folk, rock, blues, and country that sounded like no other folk-rock or country-rock material. Instead of finding the folk in rock, he found how folk rocked like hell on its own. After Stewart became successful, he began to lose the rootsier elements of his music, yet he remained a superb singer, even as he abandoned his own artistic path in favor of following pop trends. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.69% CDDA &amp; 99.79% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tMercury\nCatalog:\t\tB0004516-02\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01.Street Fighting Man\n02.Man Of Constant Sorrow\n03.An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down\n04.Handbags And Gladrags\n05.Gasoline Alley\n06.It's All Over Now\n07.Only A Hobo\n08.My Way Of Giving\n09.Country Comforts\n10.Cut Across Shorty\n11.Jo's Lament\n12.You're My Girl (I Don't Want To Discuss It)\n13.Maggie May\n14.Mandolin Wind\n15.(I Know) I'm Losing You\n16.(Find A) Reason To Believe\n\n\nCD 2\n\n01.Every Picture Tells A Story\n02.Seems Like A Long Time\n03.That's All Right/Amazing Grace\n04.Tomorrow Is A Long Time\n05.True Blue\n06.Lost Paraguayos\n07.Angel\n08.You Wear It Well\n09.I'd Rather Go Blind\n10.Twistin' The Night Away\n11.Pinball Wizard\n12.Oh!
