This will fit on a standard DVD-R if the DVD-ROM folder is removed.\n\nThe Muppets at Walt Disney World premiered on NBC on May 6, 1990 as an episode of The Magical World of Disney. It was part of an awareness campaign to promote the planned merger of The Jim Henson Company with The Walt Disney Company.\n\nIn this one-hour special, the Muppets visit Kermit's hometown of Paradise Swamp, Florida for the annual Frog Festival and Bug Fry. Once there, they discover Walt Disney World on the other side of the swamp. After a run-in with Quentin Fitzwaller, an irate, bumbling security guard played by Charles Grodin, the group splits up to explore the wonders of the theme parks and resort complex.\n\nSongs: &quot;Knee Deep&quot; &quot;Rockin' All Around the World&quot; &quot;Who's Your Lady Friend?&quot; &quot;I'm Doggin' It&quot; &quot;The Rainbow Connection&quot; &quot;Love in a Laundromat&quot; &quot;More, More, More&quot;\n\nStarring (as The Muppets) \nJim Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt, Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Kevin Clash, David Rudman, Rickey Boyd, Rick Lyon and Camille Bonora.\n\nSpecial Guests Charles Grodin as Quentin Fitzwaller, Raven-SymonÃƒÂ© as herself, Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse (uncredited)\n\n\nExecutive Producer: Jim Henson\nProducers: Diana Birkenfield and Martin G.
