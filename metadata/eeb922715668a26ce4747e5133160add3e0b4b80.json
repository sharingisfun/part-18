It takes place in the Demon District in Itogami City, a man-made island off the coast of Japan that has a freely mingling monster populace. Kojou is suspected of being a Fourth Progenitor, a powerful vampire that could potentially disrupt the balance of power among the ruling three Progenitors. Kojou and Yukina befriend various monster students, some of whom are attracted to Kojou, and whose situations drive his libido that provides the source of much of his power.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeb922715668a26ce4747e5133160add3e0b4b80","amp;dn":"Strike+the+Blood+-+Complete+720p+%5BEng+Sub%5D+%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeb922715668a26ce4747e5133160add3e0b4b80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,185,34,113,86,104,162,108,228,116,126,81,51,22,10,221,62,11,75,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
