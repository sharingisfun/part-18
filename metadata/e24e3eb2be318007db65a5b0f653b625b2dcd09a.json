One of these modern day superheroes -- SuperVip, to be exact -- is easily recognizable as such, possessing an Adonis-like physique, a dynamic personality and an array of heightened abilities. The other -- MiniVip -- is not quite so prepossessing. His growth is stunted, he wears horn-rimmed glasses, his paunch is wider than his chest, and his powers are a bit more limited than his brother's. But both Vips are needed when a Happy Betty, lady tycoon with a taste for ruling the world, rears her ugly head. The question is, can MiniVip defeat his worst enemy -- his intimidated ego -- to help save the day?
