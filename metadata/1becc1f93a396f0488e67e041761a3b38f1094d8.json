This is their first album from 1971.\n\n\n&quot;FlÃƒÂ¤sket Brinner was a Swedish band during the 70's who released two albums and had ties to Bo Hannson. \n\nThe first s/t album was released in 1971 and is an instrumental album which was recorded live. It is composed of jams of jazz-rock, heavy rock, psychedelic and some folk tunes in a somewhat free-form in the two first longer tracks and there are also the shorter tracks (which composed side B of the LP and one of which was with Bo Hansson). They play an excerpt of Bo Hansson's Lord of the Rings on Tysta Finskan. The band features Sten Bergman (keyboards) and Gunnar Bergsten (saxes) who played with Bo Hansson. Hansson himself appears on the track Bosses LÃƒÂ¥t which he wrote. All in all, a very dynamic record that gets the listener hooked. \n\nThe second album FlÃƒÂ¤sket is different from its predecessor. This is a double album which has been reissued on CD in 2003. LP 1 is the studio release and LP 2 is a live recording. It is a mixture of sounds. Mainly instrumental, LP 1 starts out as full blown fusion with great keyboards work. It then goes on to explore more styles. On the live LP, the spirit of the first album is regained in the jams and the style, but it is not as even and good as the first album. In 2003, when the second album was reissued, the band was reunited. \n\nThis band is recommended for their energetic performance and enthusiastic live shows in both albums.&quot;\n\n/Progarchives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1becc1f93a396f0488e67e041761a3b38f1094d8","amp;dn":"Fl%26auml%3Bsket+Brinner+-+Same+%281971%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1becc1f93a396f0488e67e041761a3b38f1094d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,236,193,249,58,57,111,4,136,230,126,4,23,97,163,179,143,16,148,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
