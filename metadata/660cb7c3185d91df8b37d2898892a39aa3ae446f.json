Many in the West still have only a very limited understanding of either the conflict or the forces driving it.\nExplaining Darfur provides essential resources for understanding the conflict in Darfur, from the historical background to an analysis of the present situation. It also proposes several nonviolent ways of solving the crisis, from the democratization of the Sudan to reconciliation negotiations between tribes at all levels to dramatically expanding the operational capacity of the peacekeeping troops supplied by the African Union. Initiated by the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, this will be the definitive study of the ongoing Darfur conflict and its possible solutions.\n\nAbout the Author\nAgnes van Ardenne-van der Hoeven is Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation.\nMohamed Salih is a faculty member of the Institute of Social Studies in the Hague and professor of politics of development at Leiden University.\nNick Grono is a member of the International Crisis Group.\nJuan MÃƒÂ©ndez is special advisor on the prevention of genocide to the UN Secretary General and president of the International Center for Transitional Justice.\nFouad Ibrahim is professor emeritus of the African department at the University of Bayreuth.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:660cb7c3185d91df8b37d2898892a39aa3ae446f","amp;dn":"Agnes+van+Ardenne+-+Explaining+Darfur.+Lectures+on+the+Ongoing+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"660cb7c3185d91df8b37d2898892a39aa3ae446f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,12,183,195,24,93,145,223,139,55,210,137,136,146,163,154,163,174,68,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
