In the first round, one competitor tries desperately to figure out the right cooking technique for a tricky ingredient. And a pretty citrus fruit and a spiny lobster are two of the mystery ingredients that the competitors must demystify in the entree round. Then in the final round, the two remaining stars make a mess in the kitchen and some very creative desserts with mascarpone and strawberries.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 30-Mar-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec1fdc903ccdb811fbc2c5123868600d262b95c6","amp;dn":"Chopped.S19E07.Tournament.of.Stars.Actors.HDTV.x264-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec1fdc903ccdb811fbc2c5123868600d262b95c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,31,220,144,60,205,184,17,251,194,197,18,56,104,96,13,38,43,149,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
