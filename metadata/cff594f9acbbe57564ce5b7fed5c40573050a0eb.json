From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity, there was a span of hardly more than twenty-five years. What began as merely an interesting speculative problem in physics grew into the Manhattan Project, and then into the bomb, with frightening rapidity, while scientists known only to their peersÃ¢â‚¬â€Szilard, Teller, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Meitner, Fermi, Lawrence, and von NeumannÃ¢â‚¬â€stepped from their ivory towers into the limelight.\n\nRichard Rhodes gives the definitive story of manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most awesome discovery and invention. Told in rich human, political, and scientific detail, The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a narrative tour de force and a document with literary power commensurate with its subject.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff594f9acbbe57564ce5b7fed5c40573050a0eb","amp;dn":"The+Making+of+the+Atomic+Bomb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cff594f9acbbe57564ce5b7fed5c40573050a0eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,245,148,249,172,187,229,117,100,206,91,127,237,92,64,87,48,80,160,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
