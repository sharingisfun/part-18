The album features &quot;Love is Like Oxygen&quot;, the band's last original single to hit the top 40 on both sides of the Atlantic, peaking at #8 in the United States and #9 in the UK Singles Chart. The single version of &quot;Love is Like Oxygen&quot; is substantially shorter than the full album version, and the US version having only the first verse, shorter intermezzo and the funky outro. A second single, &quot;California Nights&quot;, was released from the album but only reached #78 in the UK and #76 in the US.\n\nThis was the last album to feature the &quot;classic&quot; Sweet line-up of Brian Connolly, Andy Scott, Mick Tucker and Steve Priest. About a year after its release, while working on the next album, Connolly left the band to embark on a solo career. The remaining trio continued as Sweet and delivered three more albums before breaking up in 1982.\n\nScene was a youth magazine on First German Television, which by 1972 produced and presented each year with the corresponding date (such as ' scene ' 73').\n\nThomas Gottschalk hosted the scene, which was on Friday afternoon, from 1976 to 1979. Under him, the program developed into a pure music show with Studio performances from bands and supplemented by interviews, as on 16 July 1976 with Kiss and the first video clips, like &quot;I Do not Like Mondays&quot; by The Boomtown Rats. Sidekick Anthony Powell, was at his side in 1977 with slapstick comedy. The last episode ran on 16 November 1979. In 1980, the show returned as Pop-Stop and continued until 1983.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_Headed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_Headed&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BABMPaAEA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BABMPaAEA&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8241kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:41\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic Home Cinema&quot; player if you can't play this \n file, or for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \n It's 100% free to download and use.
