Dickinson (Author)\nHardcover: 288 pages\nPublisher: Yale University Press; First edition (January 25, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0300144865\nISBN-13: 978-0300144864\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nOver the past decade, states and international organizations have shifted a surprising range of foreign policy functions to private contractors. But who is accountable when the employees of foreign private firms do violence or create harm? This timely book describes the services that are now delivered by private contractors and the threat this trend poses to core public values of human rights, democratic accountability, and transparency. The author offers a series of concrete reforms that are necessary to expand traditional legal accountability, construct better mechanisms of public participation, and alter the organizational structure and institutional culture of contractor firms. The result is a pragmatic, nuanced, and comprehensive set of responses to the problem of foreign affairs privatization.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;The governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genieÃ¢â‚¬â€the outsourcing of military support, diplomatic security, foreign aid, information technology, and, well, governanceÃ¢â‚¬â€wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t return to the bottle. DickinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision of a modern, privatized government, that not only promotes critical public values, but also expends resources efficiently and responsibly, is as thought-provoking as it is refreshing.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Steven L. Schooner, George Washington University\n\nWinner of the 2011 Roy C. Palmer Civil Liberties Prize, as given by the Chicago-Kent College of Law\n\n&quot;Dickinson does a superb job of summarizing the issues connected with using private corporations to perform public functions overseas. . . .
