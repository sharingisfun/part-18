After a car crash, George finds himself 10 years in the past, just days before Doug's day. And before he and his colleague-friend Harvey Blinton are to be cheated out of a brilliant career in advertising by sleaze-bag Jack Harrington. However, every change to the past starts a whole series, not necessarily for the better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bd5ff20b87eee74de7d5a7408b77a35da07a20e","amp;dn":"Before.You.Say.I.Do.2009.DVDRip.XViD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bd5ff20b87eee74de7d5a7408b77a35da07a20e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,213,255,32,184,126,238,116,222,125,90,116,8,183,122,53,218,7,162,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
