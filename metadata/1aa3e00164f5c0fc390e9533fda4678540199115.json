They succeeded on a \ngrander scale than they ever could have imagined, conquering the world and \nelsewhere with this effervescent set of giddy new wave pop-soul, thereby making \nGeorge Michael a superstar and consigning Andrew Ridgeley to the confines of \nTrivial Pursuit. It was so big and the singles were so strong that it's easy to \noverlook its patchwork qualities. It's no longer than eight tracks, short even \nfor the pre-CD era, and while the four singles are strong, the rest is filler, \nincluding an Isley Brothers cover. Thankfully, it's the kind of filler that's so \ntied to its time that it's fascinating in its stilted post-disco dance-pop \nrhythms and Thatcher/Reagan materialism ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an era that encouraged songs called \n&quot;Credit Card Baby.&quot; If this dichotomy between the A-sides and B-sides is far too \ngreat to make this essential, the way Faith later would be, those A-sides range \nfrom good to terrific. &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot; is absolute silliness whose \nvery stupidity is its strength, and if &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; is merely \nagreeable bubblegum, &quot;Freedom&quot; is astounding, a sparkling Motown rip-off \nrippling with spirit and a timeless melody later ripped off by Noel Gallagher. \nThen, there's the concluding &quot;Careless Whisper,&quot; a soulful slow one where \nMichael regrets a one-night stand over a richly seductive background and a \nyearning saxophone. It was an instant classic, and it was the first indication \nof George Michael's strengths as a pop craftsman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which means it points the way \nto Faith, not the halfhearted Edge of Heaven. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWAKE ME UP BEFORE YOU GO-GO\n\nSong Review by Steve Huey\n\nThe almost blindingly bright, soul-tinged pop confection &quot;Wake Me up Before You \nGo-Go&quot; gave the British duo Wham! their first number one single in 1985, \nestablishing George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley as the premier bubblegum teen \nidol act of the mid-'80s. It was also the first clear evidence of Michael's \nseemingly effortless mastery of the pop song form, a facility he would \ndemonstrate time and time again over the next decade. &quot;Wake Me up Before You Go\n-Go&quot; is relentlessly perky, but to dismiss it as mere fluff is to overlook a \ntremendous guilty pleasure. The song is tightly and impeccably constructed, and \nits inescapable melody and bouncy beat are almost a force of nature, so \ndifficult are they to resist. Moreover, the song's individual elements are the \nwork of a fully formed pop craftsman -- from the way the keyboards and bass \ninteract and leave room for each other to breathe, to the playful bass voice \nchanting &quot;jitterbug&quot; at regular intervals, to Michael's accentuation of the \narrangement by adding (and subtracting) a lightly swinging horn section and \nsoulful backing choir. It often takes some time for the big-picture status of \nbubblegum pop tunes to become clear -- at least until the initial backlash \nagainst their ubiquitous popularity wears off -- but in retrospect, it's clear \nthat &quot;Wake Me up Before You Go-Go&quot; is one of the decade's true mainstream pop \nclassics, which is why it's become a staple of '80s retro play lists, as well as \nthe song most listeners immediately identify with Wham! \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEVERYTHING SHE WANTS\n\nSong Review by Amy Hanson\n\nAlthough ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Everything She WantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was relegated to b-side status on Wham!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1984 \nChristmas single, the song had flipped the tables by the beginning of the year, \nas a remixed version became the club hit. It encountered nary a whiff of \nresistance as it stomped up the US charts, too, following both ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Wake Me Up \nBefore You Go-GoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Careless WhisperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third #1 hit the \nfollowing March. Another glimpse of R&amp;B driven, synth swept dance grooves, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nEverything She WantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ brought in elements of classic blue-eyed soul, yet kept \nthe blast purely in step with the most popular themes of the mid 1980s. Proof \nagain that, in spite of the snide sideways glances from their own countrymen, \nWham! were able masters of an era they ruled for a solid year, delivering hit \nafter hit with ease. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFREEDOM\n\nSong Review by Amy Hanson\n\nThe second song from Make it Big to reach #1 in the UK, the song fared slightly \nworse in the U.S., resting at a paltry #3 when it followed a string of chart \ntoppers in early 1985. Light and most certainly of its era, this story of love \nand loss and loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rebirth saw Michael pull out all the stops. Continuing his \npenchant for purer pop, the vocalist once again left out the pointed political \nand social barbs of his earlier efforts, favoring innocuous patter that was then \nswept aside by the music. Here, MichaelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s multi-tracked vocals and RidgeleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nguitar are awash with elements of 60ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s girl group pop, Queen-ish turns and piano \nriffing rolls. Lush, luxurious and feel-good all the way, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½FreedomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ swept the \nband, and their fans into the stratosphere for one more romp. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSong Review by Amy Hanson\n\nThe closing set piece of the duoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Careless WhisperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was one of \nthe few songs penned by both George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley. But, with \nMichael already thinking of a solo career, and with the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s US label savvy \nenough to realize that the charismatic singer was going to stay in the public \neye, the single was credited to Wham! featuring George Michael in America, and \nas a full-on Michael solo single in the UK. To fans, however, such distinctions \nwere merely far-flung annoyances. All that mattered was getting this single, \nthis album, this band as close to the bone as possible. Built around a simmering \nLatin-lite tempo, sultry sax and MichaelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own impassioned delivery, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Careless \nWhisperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ touched fans and passive listeners alike to become one of, if not the \nonly, love songs of 1985. Clocking in at over six minutes, it was perfect for \ndance floor canoodling, and topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
