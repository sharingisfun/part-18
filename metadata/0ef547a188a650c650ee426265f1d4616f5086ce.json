As their career progressed, Madness branched away from their trademark &quot;nutty sound&quot; and incorporated large elements of Motown, soul, and British pop. Although the band managed one crossover American hit in 1983, they remained a British phenomenon, influencing several successive generations of musicians and becoming one of the most beloved groups the country produced during the '80s. \n\nAudio Quality:\t\tMp3 CBR 320\nLabel:\t\t\tVirgin\nCatalog:\t\tMADBOX2 - 7243 8 48074 0 5 \n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n\nCD1 - One Step Beyond (1979)\n\n01.One Step Beyond\n02.My Girl\n03.Night Boat To Cairo\n04.Believe Me\n05.Land Of Hope And Glory\n06.The Prince\n07.Tarzan's Nuts\n08.In The Middle Of The Night\n09.Bed And Breakfast Man\n10.Razor Blade Alley\n11.Swan Lake\n12.Rockin' In A Flat\n13.Mummy's Boy\n14.Madness\n15.Chipmunks Are Go!\n\n\nCD2 - Absolutely (1980)\n\n01.Baggy Trousers\n02.Embarrassment\n03.E.R.N.I.E.\n04.Close Escape\n05.Not Home Today\n06.On The Beat Pete\n07.Solid Gone\n08.Take It Or Leave It\n09.Shadow Of Fear\n10.Disappear\n11.Overdone\n12.In The Rain\n13.You Said\n14.Return Of The Los Palmas 7\n\nCD3 - Seven (1981)\n\n01.Cardiac Arrest\n02.Shut Up\n03.Sign Of The Times\n04.Missing You\n05.Mrs. Hutchinson\n06.Tomorrows Dream\n07.Grey Day\n08.Pac-A-Mac\n09.Promises Promises\n10.Benny Bullfrog\n11.When Dawn Arrives\n12.The Opium Eaters\n13.Day On The Town\n\nCD4 - The Rise And Fall (1982)\n\n01.Rise And Fall\n02.Tomorrow's Just Another Day\n03.Blue Skinned Beast\n04.Primrose Hill\n05.Mr. Speaker Gets The Word\n06.Sunday Morning\n07.Our House\n08.Tiptoes\n09.New Delhi\n10.That Face\n11.Calling Cards\n12.Are You Coming (With Me)\n13.Madness (Is All In The Mind)\n\nCD5 - Keep Moving (1984)\n\n01.Keep Moving\n02.Michael Caine\n03.Turning Blue\n04.One Better Day\n05.March Of The Gherkins\n06.Waltz Into Mischief\n07.Brand New Beat\n08.Victoria Gardens\n09.Samantha\n10.Time For Tea\n11.Prospects\n12.Give Me A Reason\n\nCD6 - Mad Not Mad (1985)\n\n01.I'll Compete\n02.Yesterday's Men\n03.Uncle Sam\n04.White Heat\n05.Mad Not Mad\n06.Sweetest Girl\n07.Burning The Boats\n08.Tears You Can't Hide\n09.Time\n10.Coldest Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef547a188a650c650ee426265f1d4616f5086ce","amp;dn":"Madness+-+Remastered+6CD+BoxSet+%281999%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ef547a188a650c650ee426265f1d4616f5086ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,245,71,161,136,166,80,198,80,238,66,98,101,241,212,97,111,80,134,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
