It wasn't that I couldn't write, it was more a case of not having enough experience to draw on. I found plots difficult, and had no idea how to construct believable and sympathetic characters,\n\nI didn't start writing again until I was in my late twenties and working as journalist. I'd studied biochemistry at the University of Bath, but had decided that I didn't want a career as a scientist. During my third year at university I'd worked as a barman, and one evening had fallen into conversation with a drunken journalist. He made his job sound so much fun that I decided there and then that I was going to be a reporter.\n\n After graduating, I was offered a place on the Daily Mirror Graduate Training Scheme, where I was trained as a journalist. They taught me how to ask questions, how to gather facts, and how to construct a story. In short, they taught me how to write. And once I was in the habit of writing a couple of thousand words a day, I had the confidence to start writing fiction again.\n \nHard Landing - Stephen Leather\nHot Blood - Leather_ Stephen\nInspector Zhang Gets His Wish (a free sh - Leather_ Stephen\nNightfall - Stephen Leather\nRough Justice - Stephen Leather\nSoft Target - Leather_ Stephen\nThe Basement - Leather_ Stephen\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d2dbcf96d9eeea0256eaf3a017371145ea713d","amp;dn":"Stephen+Leather+Books+%288%29%2CMobi%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d2dbcf96d9eeea0256eaf3a017371145ea713d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,210,219,207,150,217,238,234,2,86,234,243,160,23,55,17,69,234,113,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
