Probably best known as the author of &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper,&quot; in which a woman is driven mad by chauvinist psychiatry, Gilman wrote numerous other short stories and novels reflecting her radical socialist and feminist view of turn-of-the-century America. Collected here by the noted Gilman scholar Ann J. Lane are eighteen stories and fragments, including a selection from Herland, Gilman's novel of a feminist utopia. The resulting anthology provides a provocative blueprint to Gilman's intellectual and creative production.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca4c0c7280036633b2e30f3f23f1af8eea74ef17","amp;dn":"The+Charlotte+Perkins+Gilman+Reader+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca4c0c7280036633b2e30f3f23f1af8eea74ef17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,76,12,114,128,3,102,51,178,227,15,63,35,241,175,142,234,116,239,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
