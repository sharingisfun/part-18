Republished in book form shortly thereafter, it has since gone through four hardcover and sixteen paperback printings. It is a revolutionary work, astounding in its foresight and contemporaneity. The University of Illinois Press is pleased and honored to issue this commemorative reprinting of a classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:731bdc8b0ef39f2143f1482041edf1ccd4429f5c","amp;dn":"The+Mathematical+Theory+of+Communication","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"731bdc8b0ef39f2143f1482041edf1ccd4429f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,27,220,139,14,243,159,33,67,241,72,32,65,237,241,204,212,66,159,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
