All this only twelve hours before I began recording the 20 shows I record every week. But that didn't stop the countdown that doesn't stop till we reach the top.\n\n&quot;I'm Casey Kasem, this is American Top 40, and our countdown begins in a moment.&quot;\n\n\nWhat does Elton John have in common with Kenny Rogers, Deborah Harry, and Brooke Shields? Casey tells us all.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What foreign artists from non-English speaking countries have been the most successful on the American charts?&quot; Casey Gives the top five.\n\nWe find out whatever happened to The Village People.\n\nTen songs have made the top 40 twice (such as &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; by Bill Hailey and The Comets), but only one has ever hit number one twice.
