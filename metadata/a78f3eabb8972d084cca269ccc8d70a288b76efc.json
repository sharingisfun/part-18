It was released in November 1994 as the second single (after &quot;Lucky One&quot;) from her House of Love album in the United States and the fourth and final single from the album in the United Kingdom.\n\n&quot;House of Love,&quot; the second single from the album (after &quot;Lucky One&quot;), performed moderately well on the charts. Although it didn't reach the Christian radio charts, it was a huge success on the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at #5. It also cracked the Top Forty of the Billboard Hot 100, where it reached #37, and became a minor hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at #46 in that country.\n\nNotwithstanding its chart success, the remaining legacy of &quot;House of Love&quot; is that the recording sessions for the song are where Grant and Gill first spent meaningful time together, and they soon became fast friends. Throughout the 1990s they remained so. Later, Grant divorced from her husband Gary Chapman in 1999; Gill had divorced in 1998. Grant and Gill married a year later, and thus established the legacy of &quot;House of Love&quot; as the point where Amy Grant and Vince Gill first began their friendly relationship.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a78f3eabb8972d084cca269ccc8d70a288b76efc","amp;dn":"Amy+Grant+-+House+Of+Love++%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a78f3eabb8972d084cca269ccc8d70a288b76efc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,143,62,171,184,151,45,8,76,202,38,156,204,141,112,162,136,183,110,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
