Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the epicenter of a world gone wrong, its streets overrun by victims and hustlers, drifters and gangsters. Lowly contract cop Lane Anslow struggles to keep afloatÃ¢â‚¬â€and to watch out for his brilliant but bipolar brother, Johnny, a medical researcher. Lane soon discovers that Johnny is part of an experiment veiled in extraordinary secrecy. But he has no idea whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind it, how astronomical the stakes are, or how many lives might be destroyed to make it a reality. \n\nNow JohnnyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone missing. To find him, Lane follows a twisting trail into a billionaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hilltop urban fortress, a politicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner circle, a prison set in an aircraft graveyard, and a highly guarded community where people appear to be half their biological age. Hunted by dueling enemies, Lane meets a beautiful and enigmatic woman at the center of a vast web of political and criminal intrigue. And behind it all is a sinister, desperate race to claim the biggest scientific prize of all: eternal life.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21408716-the-forever-man?from_search=true&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21408716-the-forever-man?from_search=true&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e5a157aaf18245de04c2fd234d01c6a8ca65ac0","amp;dn":"The+Forever+Man-+Pierre+Ouellette+%28epub%2C+mobi%2C+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e5a157aaf18245de04c2fd234d01c6a8ca65ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,90,21,122,175,24,36,93,224,76,47,210,52,208,28,106,140,166,90,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
