The erstwhile Black Flag frontman has written books, started book publishing and record companies, established himself as a major spoken-word performer, appeared in several films and, oh yeah, he&amp;#039;s got his own band. On COME IN AND BURN, another fine Rollins Band album cut with the same efficient, take-no-prisoners, accept-no-excuses style as the rest, Rollins doesn&amp;#039;t so much sing as declaim, either in a creepily distant monotone or an urgent bark. This vocal style makes perfect sense here, as anything else would clash with the workmanlike thrash-metal churned out by the band.\nIt is the Rollins Band&amp;#039;s intention to pummel its listeners into submission, so the lack of subtlety and shifting dynamics is a functional necessity. Rollins&amp;#039; lyrics offer enough tales of pain, self-hatred and depression to make an afternoon TV talk show host drool, but he faces these emotions head on, with no sentimentality or pretension.\n\n\nRolling Stone (3/6/97, pp.67-69) - 3 Stars (out of 5) - &quot;...the loud-to-quiet dynamics and roller-coaster tempos suggest a trio whose members are responding to one another on the fly....Gibbs frequently drives the melodies with bulldozer riffs....Texture--not the number of notes played--is what counts...&quot;\n\nEntertainment Weekly (3/28/97, pp.64-65) - &quot;...For anyone who&amp;#039;s ever dreamed about a musical summit meeting between Metallica and the Mahavishnu Orchestra--we know you&amp;#039;re out there--this stuff is manna...&quot; - Rating: B-\n\nQ (5/97, p.127) - 3 Stars (out of 5) - &quot;...Rollins is still one of the best writers on the alternative scene. \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73f49247c744910f0f69723aaa2c2e0a53595102","amp;dn":"Rollins+Band+-+Come+In+And+Burn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73f49247c744910f0f69723aaa2c2e0a53595102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,244,146,71,199,68,145,15,15,105,114,58,170,44,46,10,83,89,81,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
