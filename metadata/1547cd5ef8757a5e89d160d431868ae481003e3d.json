Crystalline and pitch-perfect, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the sort of classic-sounding soprano that belongs to an earlier decade, when folksingers wore flowers in their hair and sang songs about free love. Ahn is the product of a more current generation, but she fills her second album with songs that are just as timeless, from stripped-down Laurel Canyon folk tunes to lightly orchestrated chamber pop ballads. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of acoustic guitar here, as well as soft splashes of piano, lap steel, and strings, but AhnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are the focal point. She saturates When You Grow Up with double- and triple-tracked harmonies, and most of the songsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ instrumental hooks are sung rather than played, creating a sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ornate but still intimate. She duets with Charlie Wadhams on Ã¢â‚¬Å“I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Have Time to Be in Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tips her hat to former collaborator Benji Hughes with a slow, sexy cover of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vibe So Hot,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and co-writes with singers like Inara George, Sia Furler, and Eleni Mandell on some of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best songs. Yet despite the heavy guest list, When You Grow Up still feels more personal than AhnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2008 debut, which found her dabbling in indie pop, torch songs, and Norah Jones-styled jazz. She focuses on folk this time around, consolidating her strengths while exploring every quirky corner of the genre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1547cd5ef8757a5e89d160d431868ae481003e3d","amp;dn":"Priscilla+Ahn+-+When+You+Grow+Up+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1547cd5ef8757a5e89d160d431868ae481003e3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,71,205,94,248,117,122,94,137,209,96,212,49,134,138,228,129,0,62,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
