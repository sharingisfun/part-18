It is also the setting for a tangled web of politics, personal ambition, love, jealousy, and murder.\n\nTelescopes on Earth have detected an Earth-sized planet circling a star some 30 light-years away. Now the race is on to get pictures of that distant world, photographs and spectra that show whether or not the planet is truly like Earth - and if it bears life. Farside observatory will have the largest optical telescope in the solar system as well as a vast array of radio antennas, the most sensitive radio telescope possible, insulated from the interference of EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radio chatter by a thousand kilometers of the moonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solid body.\n\nBuilding Farside is a complex, often dangerous task. On the airless surface of the moon, under constant bombardment by hard radiation and in-falling micrometeoroids, builders must work in cumbersome spacesuits and use robotic machines as much as possible. Breakdowns - mechanical and emotional - are commonplace. Accidents happen, some of them fatal. But what they ultimately find will stun everyone, and the human race will never be the same.\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Stefan Rudnicki\nLength: 9 hrs and 40 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nSeries: Grand Tour (Bova), Book 9\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:02-12-13\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3bffd493102c8b0a746908c87bf0cc95f12045a","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+Farside+%28The+Grand+Tour+%239%29+%5BAUDIBLE+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3bffd493102c8b0a746908c87bf0cc95f12045a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,191,253,73,49,2,200,176,167,70,144,140,135,191,12,201,95,18,4,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
