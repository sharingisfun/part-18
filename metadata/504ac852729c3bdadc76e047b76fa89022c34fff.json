The &quot;Catalysts for Fine Chemical Synthesis&quot; series contains tested and validated procedures which provide a unique range resources for chemists who work in organic chemistry.\n..&quot;. of great value to synthetic organic chemists...&quot; (The Chemists, Summer 2003)\n\nVolume 3 in the series focuses on catalysts for carbon-carbon bond formation and presents practical and detailed protocols on how to use sophisticated catalysts by the &quot;inventors&quot; and &quot;developers&quot; who created them. The combination of protocols and review commentaries helps the reader to easily and quickly understand and use the new high-tech catalysts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:504ac852729c3bdadc76e047b76fa89022c34fff","amp;dn":"Catalysts+For+Fine+Chemical+Synthesis+Vol+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"504ac852729c3bdadc76e047b76fa89022c34fff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,74,200,82,114,156,59,218,220,118,224,71,183,111,168,144,34,195,79,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
