Elina and Tuomas have had a happy relationship for over a year and are planning to get married.\n\nA chain reaction of events starts after Niko forges a 500 euro note. In the film&amp;acute;s other plot, the attack planned by Tuomas and Elina on an information network has grave consequences.\n\nFrozen Land is an intense, fast-paced and realistic depiction of today&amp;acute;s Finland. It contains several dramatic and tragic events and plenty of action, but also warmth.\n\nThe film has an episodic structure, where the stories are not always linked to each other in a chronological order. \n\nhttp://www.ses.fi/en/film.asp?id=583\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec84e29721d16e8671a54a7d83ccb017bf086964","amp;dn":"Paha.Maa.2005.FiNNiSH.DVDRip.XviD-PROFiLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec84e29721d16e8671a54a7d83ccb017bf086964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,132,226,151,33,209,110,134,113,165,74,125,131,204,176,23,191,8,105,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
