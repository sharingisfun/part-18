Wild Side\n2. Miracles\n3. Lover\n4. Roller Coasting\n\nCMHHTD is DJ Muggs (Cypress Hill), Andrew Kline (Strife), Brevi, Sean Bonner\n\n\nThese four songs are our first &quot;traditional release&quot; however this project has been manifesting itself on the streets for close to a year. Unsuspecting pedestrians around the world have been enjoying and participating in this project - sometimes without even knowing it. Inconspicuous art installations and street music boxes have been hidden in such cities as Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo, Rome, Belfast, Prague, and Vienna. We're trying to manipulate the way people find music; to bring back the thrill of discovery; to make something about this all exciting again. This is less a standalone record as it is just a part of a soundtrack to a larger art project. In fact we'll working on several art gallery pieces as well. \n\nWe're licensing these songs with a Non Commercial Creative Commons License. \n\nTake them. Pass them around. Do awesome stuff with them.\n\nYou can find us online at \ncmhhtd.com\n\nLet us know what you think, we're trying to do something cool and different. Hope you like it...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4328a02d9f594a0afa510a0f593bbdad9b22a1f3","amp;dn":"Cross+My+Heart+Hope+To+Die+s%2Ft+ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4328a02d9f594a0afa510a0f593bbdad9b22a1f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,40,160,45,159,89,74,10,250,81,10,15,89,59,189,173,155,34,161,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
