Life out of Balance (Godfrey Reggio, 1983)\n\nMade in 1983, ?KOYAANISQATSI? was shot mostly in the desert southwest USA and New York City on a tiny budget with no script. But it then attracted the support of Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas and reached a much wider audience. Its techniques, merging cinematographer Ron Fricke's time-lapse shots (alternately peripatetic and hyper speed) with Glass' reiterative music (from the meditative to the orgiastic)--as well as its ecology minded imagery--crept into the consciousness of popular culture. The influence of ?KOYAANISQATSI? has by now become unmistakable in television advertisements, music videos and, of course, similar movies. \n\nPOWAQQATSI ? Life in Transformation (Godfrey Reggio, 1988)\n\nDating from 1988, ?POWAQQATSI? finds the director somewhat more directly polemical than before, with Glass's score stretching to embrace world music. Reggio reuses techniques familiar from the previous film (slow motion, time-lapse, superposition) to dramatize the effects of the so-called First World on the Third: displacement, pollution, alienation. But he spends as much time beautifully depicting what various cultures have lost--cooperative living, a sense of joy in labour and religious values--as he does confronting viewers with trains, airliners, coal cars and loneliness. What had been a more or less peaceful, slow-moving, spiritually fulfilling rural existence for these &quot;silent&quot; people (all we hear is music and sound effects) becomes a crowded, suffocating, accelerating industrial urban hell, from Peru to Pakistan. Reggio frames ?POWAQQATSI? with a telling image: the Serra Pelada gold mines, where thousands of men, their clothes and skin imbued with the earth they're moving, carry wet bags up steep slopes in a Sisyphean effort to provide wealth for their employers. While Glass juxtaposes his strangely joyful music, which includes the voices of South American children, a number of these men carry one of their exhausted comrades out of the pit, his head back and arms outstretched--one more sacrifice to Caesar. Nevertheless, Reggio, a former member of the Christian Brothers, seems to maintain hope for renewal. \n\nNAQOYQATSI ? Life as War (Godfrey Reggio, 2002)\n\nWith a pulsing Philip Glass soundtrack graced by the beautiful cello music of Yo-Yo Ma, Godfrey Reggio's ?NAQOYQATSI? is the final installment of his Qatsi trilogy, which also includes ?KOYAANISQATSI? and ?POWAQQATSI?. In this film, computer-enhanced imagery rolls across the screen to the tune of the Glass concert music. ?NAQOYQATSI? makes a departure from the previous films, which centred on the often cruel but always fascinating struggle for survival on Earth. This film focuses mostly on technology, industry, and our increasingly machine-operated world, focusing on the United States. Not only are its images largely computer-generated, the film is in itself about computer-generated images. Strings of numbers swirl into a tunnel of black and green code, rainbow-coloured Windows icons flash across the screen, and a glowing computerized globe twirls in programmed perfection. More natural imagery, such as a horse running, oceans waves crashing, or soldiers sounding off in formation, is displayed in computer-edited negative. While the visuals start to look like stock photography, their generic nature communicates another message about the narrowing of our vision as technology and industry facilitate the conversion to a more efficient, systemized, productivity driven global society.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n\n... simply search for 'freakyflicks' \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:660534428376fe3650c61842070d266af1bef7e2","amp;dn":"The+Qatsi+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"660534428376fe3650c61842070d266af1bef7e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,5,52,66,131,118,254,54,80,198,24,66,7,13,38,106,241,190,247,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
