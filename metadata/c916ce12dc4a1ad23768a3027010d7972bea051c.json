We're now up to our 10th bundle on the year, which is approximately 20 gigs of music.  And that accounts for a total of 279 releases for 2013.\n\nA quick break down of this bundle for those interested.  Now I may be off on some of my genres, but I have these listed accordingly.  So if you're looking for Indie / Folk then check out All Delighted People, or Andrew Taylor.  If you're looking for Rock then how about Andrew Marcus, Citizens, Fit For A King, Needtobreathe, Satellite, or Stryper?  Techno, we have Andy Hunter.  Singer / Songwriter we have Bird Courage.  Surprisingly, there is a whole lot of Metal / Hardcore bundled today which includes Chaos Invocation, Dynasty, For Today, Hundredth, I Prayed For An Afterlife, and Northern Aggression.  If you're looking for Alternative, how about Courrier, I Am Empire, Ian Yates, or Paramore's new single called &quot;Still In You&quot;?  There's not a lot of Hop-Hop / Rap to choose from other than J Boy, or Whiteout.  How about Praise &amp; Worship?  New Has Come has a nice &quot;Alive In Him&quot; single.  Acoustic perhaps?  Oasis Church.  Pop?  One Republic.  There's also a fairly nice Blues release by Slide Brothers included today.  And Stigma should take care of your Punk needs.\n\nSpecifically, this 10th bundle includes the following 29 titles...\n\n * All Delighted People - 2013 - When The Morning Comes\n * Andrew Marcus - 2013 - When Winter Falls Summer Springs\n * Andrew Taylor - 2013 - Grey And Other Colors\n * Andy Hunter - 2013 - Glowing Collision\n * Bird Courage - 2013 - Mayshower - Single\n * Chaos Invocation - 2013 - Black Mirror Hours\n * Citizens - 2013 - Citizens\n * Courrier - 2013 - Cathedrals Of Color\n * Dynasty - 2013 - Beyond Measure\n * Fit For A King - 2013 - Creation Destruction\n * For Today - 2013 - Prevailer EP\n * Hundredth - 2013 - Revolt\n * I Am Empire - 2013 - Anchors\n * I Prayed For An Afterlife - 2013 - The Truth Inside\n * Ian Yates - 2013 - Really Good News\n * J Boy - 2013 - Tell This World\n * Needtobreathe - 2013 - Caercas Blancas EP\n * New Has Come - 2013 - Alive In Him - Single\n * Northern Aggression - 2013 - Abducted By Jesus\n * Oasis Church - 2013 - Sometimes - Single\n * One Republic - 2013 - Native\n * Paramore - 2013 - Still In You - Single\n * Satellite - 2013 - Calling Birds\n * Slide Brothers - 2013 - Robert Randolph Presents The Slide Brothers\n * Stigma - 2013 - For Love And Glory\n * Stryper - 2013 - Bleeding From Inside Out - Single\n * Stryper - 2013 - Second Coming\n * Various - 2013 - Mars Hill Music Worship Sampler\n * Whiteout - 2013 - Untitled\n\nFor Him,\nTorrentTracts - March 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c916ce12dc4a1ad23768a3027010d7972bea051c","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+10%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c916ce12dc4a1ad23768a3027010d7972bea051c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,22,206,18,220,74,26,210,55,104,163,2,112,16,215,151,43,234,5,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
