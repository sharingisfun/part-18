This series came out of the mid-eighties Crisis on Infinite Earths event.\n\nAt the request of Ted Kord, Dan Garrett, the original Blue Beetle, travels to Pago Island. Dan Garrett is killed while battling an army of killer robots created by Ted&amp;#039;s Uncle Jarvis. With his dying breath, he asks Ted Kord to take the scarab and become the Blue Beetle. But the cave collapses, forcing Ted to flee before he can claim the mystical device. Thus he designs his own version of the Blue Beetle. Although Ted had no super-powers, he used his intellect, natural athletic ability and resources to create various gadgets to aid him in his fight against crime. He became a member of the Justice League where he was known as much for his humour and his friendship with Booster Gold as for his heroism. \t\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a58352892475d9d4ab3751e2635f69d8a13b748","amp;dn":"Blue+Beetle+v1+%28DC+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a58352892475d9d4ab3751e2635f69d8a13b748","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,88,53,40,146,71,93,157,74,179,117,30,38,53,246,157,138,19,183,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
