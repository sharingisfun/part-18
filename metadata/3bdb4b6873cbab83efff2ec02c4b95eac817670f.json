As a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Dr. Paul tirelessly works for limited, constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies. He is known among his congressional colleagues and his constituents for his consistent voting record. Dr. Paul never voted for legislation unless the proposed measure was expressly authorized by the Constitution. In the words of former Treasury Secretary William Simon, Dr. Paul is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“one exception to the Gang of 535Ã¢â‚¬Â³ on Capitol Hill.\n\nRon Paul was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, before proudly serving as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force during the 1960s. He and his wife Carol moved to Texas in 1968, where he began his medical practice in Brazoria County. As a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology, Dr. Paul has delivered more than 4,000 babies. He and Carol, who reside in Lake Jackson, Texas, are the proud parents of five children and have 17 grandchildren.\n\nWhile serving in Congress during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dr. PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s limited-government ideals were not popular in Washington. In 1976, he was one of only four Republican congressmen to endorse Ronald Reagan for president.\n\nDuring that time, Congressman Paul served on the House Banking committee, where he was a strong advocate for sound monetary policy and an outspoken critic of the Federal ReserveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inflationary measures. He was an unwavering advocate of pro-life and pro-family values. Dr. Paul consistently voted to lower or abolish federal taxes, spending and regulation, and used his House seat to actively promote the return of government to its proper constitutional levels. In 1984, he voluntarily relinquished his House seat and returned to his medical practice.\n\nDr. Paul returned to Congress in 1997 to represent the 14th congressional district of Texas. He served on the House Committee on Financial Services and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. After retiring from Congress in early 2013, Ron Paul continues to advocate a dramatic reduction in the size of the federal government and a return to constitutional principles.\n\nRon PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s consistent voting record prompted one of his congressional colleagues to say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ron Paul personifies the Founding FathersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ideal of the citizen-statesman. He makes it clear that his principles will never be compromised, and they never are.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Another colleague observed, Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are few people in public life who, through thick and thin, rain or shine, stick to their principles. Ron Paul is one of those few.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBrief Overview of Congressman PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Record:\n\nHe has never voted to raise taxes.\nHe has never voted for an unbalanced budget.\nHe has never voted for a federal restriction on gun ownership.\nHe has never voted to raise congressional pay.\nHe has never taken a government-paid junket.\nHe has never voted to increase the power of the executive branch.\nHe voted against the Patriot Act.\nHe voted against regulating the Internet.\nHe voted against the Iraq war.\nHe does not participate in the lucrative congressional pension program.\nHe returns a portion of his annual congressional office budget to the U.S. treasury every year.\n\nRon Paul the last Founding Father of The United States of America.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bdb4b6873cbab83efff2ec02c4b95eac817670f","amp;dn":"Ron+Paul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bdb4b6873cbab83efff2ec02c4b95eac817670f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,219,75,104,115,203,171,131,239,255,46,192,44,75,149,234,200,23,103,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
