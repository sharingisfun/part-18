He even tries making one of his own. For many the dream of having a bolt hole or a place to escape from their hectic lives can seem unobtainable. Architect George Clarke shows how such big dreams can be achieved in small and affordable places. George meets the creative people who are making homes out of shipping containers, horseboxes and old buses. Others are building tiny huts or incredible treehouses in the middle of the woods. George also undertakes a small-build property project of his own, buying a dilapidated caravan for just Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£300, with the aim of transforming it into a stunning second home for his growing family.\n\n\n\n\n5)  Beach Hut, Showmans Carriage \nGeorge meets a man who drunkenly bought a 1920s showman's carriage on eBay, but quickly sobered up when he saw the poor condition it was in. He visits a holiday home built from an old World War II vehicle and follows the build of Britain's most landlocked beach hut, based in Birmingham. And George faces a major setback with his own project to create an ultra-modern holiday home out of a 1970s caravan, when he discovers the windows he's ordered are actually meant for a boat.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/420/georgeclarkesamazingspak.jpg http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/2430/georgeclarkesamazingspa.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1939 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16.9\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 48.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.channel4.com/programmes/george-clarkes-amazing-spaces/4od\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acebe363453c0360d57f5a2ff736d6cadd67ba42","amp;dn":"Ch4.George.Clarkes.Amazing.Spaces.5of6.Beach.Hut.Showmans.Carria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acebe363453c0360d57f5a2ff736d6cadd67ba42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,235,227,99,69,60,3,96,213,127,90,47,247,54,214,202,221,103,186,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
