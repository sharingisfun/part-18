This Polydor recording was never made available on cassette or LP, unlike the Varese Sarabande release, which includes two songs not on the Polydor version (the &quot;Moonfall Quartet&quot; and &quot;Ceylon&quot;).  &quot;Ceylon&quot; was dropped from the show during its run, and replaced with &quot;A British Subject,&quot; which is only available on the Australian cast album.\n\nThis is a mix of the Poldyor and Varese Sarabande albums, both of which are out of print and only available (often at a high price) from secondhand vendors.  The track order of the Varese release is preserved, with the addition of the various detective and murderer solutions and a special dialogue track entitled &quot;A Word From Your Chairman&quot; regarding the various endings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d39f48bf83f53f46aaf2ea59d6ff2dacbda0fd75","amp;dn":"The+Mystery+of+Edwin+Drood+out+of+print+cast+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d39f48bf83f53f46aaf2ea59d6ff2dacbda0fd75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,159,72,191,131,245,63,70,170,242,234,89,214,255,45,172,189,160,253,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
