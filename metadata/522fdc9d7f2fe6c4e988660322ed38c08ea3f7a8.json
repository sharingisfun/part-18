But perhaps their most famous series is the United States at War series, hosted by George C. Scott.  This series was produced on 24 C90 minute cassettes in 1989, across 9 wars:\n\n1. The American Revolution  (4 cassettes)\n2. The War of 1812 (2 cassettes)\n3. The Mexican-American War (2 cassettes)\n4. The Civil War (4 cassettes)\n5. The Spanish American War (1 cassette)\n6. World War I (3 cassettes)\n7. World War II (4 cassettes)\n8. The Korean War (1 cassette)\n9. The Vietnam War (3 cassettes)\n\nKnowledge Products packaged these in volumes of two cassettes each, 12 volumes in all.  In doing so, the American Revolution, the Civil War and World War II were split into two volumes, released as Part 1 and Part 2, whereas The War of 1812 and the Mexican American War were individual volumes.  The Spanish American War and the Korean War, being a single cassette each, were handled differently.  The Spanish American War and World War I Part 1 were sold as one volume, as was the Korean War and the Vietnam War Part 1.  The last 2 of the 3 cassettes of World War I and Vietnam War were each sold as a Part 2 volume.\n\nIn 1998, Simon &amp; Schuster Audio leased the rights to these titles and re-released them (again on cassette) but to a wider audience, under the branding Ã¢â‚¬Å“All You Want to Know: The United States at WarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  They replaced the introductory Ã¢â‚¬Å“Knowledge Products presents Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with their own Ã¢â‚¬Å“From Simon &amp; Schuster Audio, All You Want to Know Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Furthermore, they edited out the end credits, which listed the various writers, editors, producers, etc.  Another change they made was to sell the series in groups of four cassettes (rather than two), so that the American Revolution, the Civil War and World War II were each sold as single complete volumes.  Likewise, the Spanish-American War and World War I were sold together as a single volume.  Presumably, there were plans to release the Korean/Vietnam Wars and War of 1812/Mexican American War volumes as well, but this never happened.  I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if it was because sales were low for the more popular wars and that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother, or if interested faded.\n\nIn 2006, Blackstone Audio acquired this series from Knowledge Products (and may have acquired KP altogether), and released these on CD as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Audio Classic seriesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).  They reinstated both the original Ã¢â‚¬Å“Knowledge Products presents Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ introduction as well the end credits at the conclusion.  Blackstone also distributed the series in two collections: One organization was original 12 volumes by Knowledge Products (as described above), and a new collection of 8 volumes, with each war being its own distinct volume, with the only exception being the Korean and Vietnam Wars sharing the same volume.  Blackstone Audio also made some of these available on MP3 CD.  Most recently, Blackstone Audio has made these lectures available via Audible and iTunes downloads in 2012.  iTunes has both collection types, with rather bizarre pricing (such as the Spanish-American War volume being $2 more expensive than the Spanish American/World War I Part 1 volume).\n\nI have reconstructed these lectures from a variety of sources above.  I have chosen to organize each war its own volume, making 9 volumes in all.  I acquired these volumes from whatever source happened to be cheapest or most convenient.  In this torrent, Volumes 1, 5 and 6 came from Simon &amp; Schuster cassettes, Volumes 3, 4, 8 &amp; 9 came from Blackstone Audio CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, and Volume 2 came from original Knowledge Products audio cassettes.  Volume 7 is a mix: Part 1 came from Blackstone Audio CDs, whilst Part 2 came from original Knowledge Products cassettes.  Items ripped from CD are typically broken into 3 minute tracks, give or take a minute.  Items from cassette I ripped each side to mp3, which is typically around 35-40 minutes, give or take.  My apologies for the seemingly inconsistent track arrangements, but this is why it appears as such.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:522fdc9d7f2fe6c4e988660322ed38c08ea3f7a8","amp;dn":"United+States+at+War%2C+hosted+by+George+C.+Scott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"522fdc9d7f2fe6c4e988660322ed38c08ea3f7a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,47,220,157,127,47,230,196,233,136,102,3,34,237,56,192,142,163,247,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
