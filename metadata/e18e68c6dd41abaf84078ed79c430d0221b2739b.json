The fact that their range encompassed jazz as well as rhythm &amp; blues, coupled with some elements of their appearance and presentation -- co-founder/keyboardist Manfred Mann's bearded, bespectacled presence -- also made the Manfreds more of a thinking person's band than a cute, cuddly, outfit like the Beatles, or sexual provocateurs in the manner of the Rolling Stones. Yet, their approach to R&amp;B was as valid as that of the Stones, equally compelling and often more sophisticated. They charted an impressive number of singles from 1964 through 1969, and developed a large, loyal international fandom that lingers to this day.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/manfred-mann-p417071/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/manfred-mann-p417071/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
