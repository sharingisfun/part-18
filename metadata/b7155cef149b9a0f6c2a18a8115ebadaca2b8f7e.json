John Leguizamo's FREAK was the main title in triple pack.\nI have already released FREAK on the pirate bay (http://thepiratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3284560).  The \nthird dvd in the triple pack was labeled as a bonus dvd and is a show called &amp;quot;BRAVO Profiles&amp;quot; which this episode\nis about John Leguizamo.  this bonus dvd will be released on the pirate bay soon. but enough about the other discs!\n\n\n\n---------------\n\n\nJohn Leguizamo's Sexaholix (a love story) [2002] - http://imdb.com/title/tt0318062/\n\n(taken from imdb.com)\n In this one-man stage show, John Leguizamo acts out scenes from his past family life, touching on his \nrelationships with his mother and father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles, and his wife and children. \nHe shares with us the lessons he's learned from his life experiences. I can't imagine there are too many people \nwho couldn't relate to some of them. At times it's so intimate that it's hard to watch, but at other times it's\nincredibly moving. And of course, it's funny. Mr. Leguizamo is so talented, it's a crime that he doesn't get \nbetter film roles. Hopefully, that will change soon.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\nJohn Leguizamo's Mambo Mouth [1991] - http://imdb.com/title/tt0247497/\n\n(taken from imdb.com)\n MAMBO MOUTH is profane, scathing, blunt, and brutally honest. It is also one of the best stand up performances \never devised. I had the opportunity to see MAMBO MOUTH on television when I was a kid and it was the first time \nI was introduced to John Leguizambo. Very few people know about his history as a playwright before his various \nacting performances in film. MAMBO MOUTH is based on his won Obie award-winning play. Throughout the performance, \nhe depicts various character stereotypes (including a woman) in his own unique, and very funny way. An excellent \nperformance!\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Available on The Pirate Bay:\n  - John Leguizamo - FREAK\n        http://thepiratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3284560\n  - John Leguizamo - The Pest\n        http://thepiratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3304808","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7155cef149b9a0f6c2a18a8115ebadaca2b8f7e","amp;dn":"John+Leguizamo+%7E+Sexaholix+%26+Mambo+Mouth+%7E+Custom+DVD+%5BNTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7155cef149b9a0f6c2a18a8115ebadaca2b8f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,21,92,239,20,155,154,15,108,42,24,168,17,94,186,218,202,43,143,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
