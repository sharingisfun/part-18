It is also opera and other styles. \n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\n\nSasha VINE VOICE\n\nThough the years I had a certain soft spot for a particular artists whose recordings I would collect. Than I noticed that even recording labels have strong appeal - and one of the most desirable became british &quot;Hyperion&quot; named after a Titan in greek mythology. (No wonder,as I grew up with greek mythology)\n\n&quot;Hyperion&quot; started as independent company in 1980 and quickly established its name by some of highly unusual and brilliant recordings of which probably the most impressive was 1984 album of music by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen titled &quot;A Feather On The Breath Of God&quot; and that was really ground-breaking hit that put &quot;Hyperion&quot; on the world map. I loved that album forever,not really knowing at that time anything about little recording company that focused its attention to less-known and neglected pieces far from usual crowd pleasing repertoire. People from &quot;Hyperion&quot; always made a point of looking deep in the corners to find something interesting,not to mention a stunning list or artists who recorded for them,it seems that it became a question of prestige to work with &quot;Hyperion&quot;. Thanks to &quot;Gramophone&quot; who was championing and showering them with awards left and right, I eventually became enthralled with &quot;Hyperion&quot; enough to start collecting their albums whenever I could - in these days when CD shops are disappearing it became a bit difficult but everytime I visit UK,I make a point of buying several &quot;Hyperion&quot; releases,they always made me happy - in fact,i now came to the point when &quot;Hyperion&quot; label is a recommendation in itself.\n\nThis generous CD is a perfect introduction to &quot;Hyperion&quot; catalogue and I could easily recommend it to anybody without reservations.\nFrom Purcell to Erik Satie, from sacred music by 16. century giants to Franz Liszt, from joyful &quot;Phil the fluter's Ball&quot; to Boccherini this is just a pure pleasure. I often find myself enjoying these various selection because of the eccentric choice assembled - since music jumps from one century to another, it avoids repetitive atmosphere and it simply floats around nicely.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Essential Hyperion\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: The Essential Hyperion\nGenre................: Concerto\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 42 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality MP3 Available)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 239kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
