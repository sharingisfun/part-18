But first thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one loose end in Auckland she needs to tie up: her obsession with her older brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend, Hunter Chase. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sick of being Ã¢â‚¬Å“kid zonedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to make like one of her kick-ass computer game heroines and take matters into her own hands. Except when she finally has Hunter where she wants him, her hands are the last thing heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll let her use. Hunter works hard at running the construction firm he co-owns with his friend, and at keeping his distance from his dysfunctional family. Control is his linchpin, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one spanner in the worksÃ¢â‚¬â€Ellie. The girl he always looked out for suddenly seems determined to make him see her as a woman. But with a past darker than the angel wings tattooed on his back, the safest place for her is just beyond armÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s length. Or the next heart to suffer damage could be hers.\nGenre: Contemporary Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb04662f0f9a031f365d096fdeb3e7563eb9e726","amp;dn":"Taking+Him+%28Lies+We+Tell%29+-+Ashenden%2C+Jackie.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb04662f0f9a031f365d096fdeb3e7563eb9e726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,4,102,47,15,154,3,31,54,93,9,111,222,179,231,86,62,185,231,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
