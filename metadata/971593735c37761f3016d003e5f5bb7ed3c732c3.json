If Band of Joy demonstrated one thing at\nNashvilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s War Memorial, it was the potency of carnal thrust as trance-inducer and\nfirestarter.\n\nAnd if one would argue that Robert PlantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest musical incarnation lacks the seismic sonic\nforce of the band that gave him fame, it could also be argued that Led Zeppelin was a hamfisted\npummel to the stone solid, utterly mersmerizing grooves now conjured by Plant,\nsongwriter/artists/multi-instrumentalists Buddy Miller, Darrell Scott, Patty Griffin, bassist Byron\nHouse and drummer Marco Giovino.\n\nWalking out with no fan fair in a black shirt and pointy boots, the dirty blond icon reached for\nhis mic stand, wailed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLet me take you to the movies, let me take you to the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nunleashing an almost knee-bending frisson in ZeppelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sigmature ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouses of the HolyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that\nwas as innocent as it was unholy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and it was obvious everything the audience knew was\nabout to go so much deeper. Deeper, indeed. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTangerineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ became a meditation that\ntransfixed and transformed, while the BoJÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMonkey,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which Plant tagged as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLo-FiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in his\nintroduction, was equal parts sonic topography surf and an exploration of something just\nbeyond the realm of white noise.\n\nIndeed, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMonkeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ could be the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSweet JaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of skin. Trance meets rural musical sensibiities,\nyearning and deliverance stretched across GiovinoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pulsing beats and MillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s squaloring\nguitar tones, a bit neon underwater, a skosh futurist high beam. But it is in getting lost in the\nemotional forcefield, the tug of those rhythms that one arrives at a higher plane.\n\n\nHigher planes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sexual and salvational ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ have much to do with Band of JoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narcotic effect.\nA steady vein of religion runs through ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ be it the gripping ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSatan Your Kingdom Must Come\nDown,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ delivered with a ferocity worthy of Pentecostals and intertwined with GriffinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own fullthrottle\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWade In The WaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ interjection, GriffinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s break-out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMove UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and MillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomewhere Trouble DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Go,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ equal bits frenzy, nerves and breakthrough resolution.\n\nPlant is a generous icon. Prowling the stage in full lion capacity, he sees no need to flex or\nhog to declare dominance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ yet, nowhere is he more impacting than standing in the back\nblowing an intense blues harmonica to reinforce Darrell ScottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wide-open, hard Appalachian\nyet almost elegiac turn on Porter WagonerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSatsfied Mind.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Scott ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nbanjo/mando/steel guitar/bouzouki utility player, has a craggy mountain voice that fills a room\nand can match Plant for power and for pathos.\n\nStill, this show was not a tumble of harder, deeper, louder. No, Band of JoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strength ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nbeyond the depths they seek in terms of rhythms, harmonies and emotional nuance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is the\nway slow feels intense and quick is euphoric. Like the yoga notion of tantra, which applies to\nmore than sex in spite of what Sting might suggest, BoJ seeks to immerse the fan in a\ncomplete song experience: feelings, beats, cultures, moments. To be pulled from the shore,\nperhaps drowned, certainly delivered is only the beginning.\n\nAnd exuberance is a big part of the deal. A romp through Los LobosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAngel BandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was as\nsparkling and euphoric as anything a handful of amyl nitrate and Goldfrapp might elicit, while\nthe redux of the utterly frugalicious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Buy My LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is pluck and effervescence, sass\nand vinegar on the half-shell. The latter also featured the Tinkerbelle-sized Griffin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in her\nknee high, skyscraping stileto boots and beaded tribal print mini dress ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as a honey-soaked\nAretha Frankin, throwing it out hard and letting it land where it will.\n\nIt is that sort of jubiliance that marks the thrill of musical consort. To come together, to writhe\nin the realm of melody and rock with abandonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ For Plant, legs crossed like a mandrake root,\nbody at times bent in half, there was the full tumble to the song, yet an elegance that added\nan erotic charge that belied anything more than total want. To surrender, to shake, to be fully\npresent in the wash of notes is a strength only for those who can be unadorned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and it\ndefined the man who welcomed the audience to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œan evening of strings, voices and skin.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nHarkening back to his original Band of JoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s run in EnglandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnderground Clubs,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where\nstages were shared with unknowns like Pink Floyd and Richard Thompson, the ardor of the\npast culled a passionate presence as the Miller-driven dervish-feeling excavation of\nThompsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouse of CardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was a howl of Zeppelin-esque proportion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ shudder-inducing\nand hypnotic with its tremolo quiver and call and response almost Druidic vocals.\n\nThose vocals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at times 5 voices raised in a wall of parts and truths ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ have a blunt force\ntrauma impact, but always to a muscular celestiality. Even the darkness of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGallows Pole,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a\nransom for a man slated to die and running out of options, had a frenzy to the parts that\nsuggested urgency, yes, but also a desperation that worked from a cellular level. It was nowor-\nnever forevermore and thenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and in that swirling, whirling charge, pulses ratchet up and\nthe exquisite tension is compressed again and again until those voices burst into one final\nlast moment of deliverance.\n\nIt is an urgency that canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be faked, canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be looped, canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be sequenced. It is what real\nmusicians, men and women who undrstand songs from the inside out, can coax and tease\nfrom what lesser mortals reduce to progressions of notes and chord changes. Even\nsomething as lilting as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCindy, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Marry You SomedayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is given a richer template of desire\nand need from the seamless execution and respect for the roots.\n\nBut itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just the ability of the players. It is more the essence of who these people are and\nthe way they come together in the name of something sacred. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRamble OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is equal parts\nmystic meander and cathartic arrival; as much freedom and exploration of self as rogueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nexplanation. Yet there was a point of jaw-dropping combustion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ buoyed by exemplary\nplayers who not only ignited, but pushed the storied rocker to a place where his voice shook\nwith the full potential of the lyric.\n\nStill in fine voice, PlantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance filled the room with an urgency of arrival, a need to be\nfree, a will to be gone and the relentlessness of one who is possessed by drives and calmed\nonly by the motion. It is not a choice that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRamble OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ demonstrates, but more an urgency to\nbreathe and a recognition of what kind of fire creates this truth in motion. It is not tortured, it is\nconsumed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and never has Plant sounded so compelling.\n\nIn the organic reality being created with the not-folk-based, but highly old school Band of Joy,\nthe jagged places are part of it. To be able to hang onto a guitarline, a beat so deep you can\nfall into it, a voice that quivers with sentiment and power, those are the things that make\nmusic at its most unprocessed and raw so compellingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and when players this good come\ntogether, it is sparks and fireworks from the sheer chemistry and joy in the playing.\n\nThat raw essebtialism is absolutely the defining modality for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsurpriseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ opening act the North\nMississippi All-Stars as well. Playing as a duo Cody and Luther Dickinson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ son of legendary\nMemphis producer/music man Jim Dickinson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ put the guitar/drum wall of sound to full\nexpression. Mining blues, rural song structures and gospel, the pair offered full-immersion to\na coterie of unadorned songs that were all thrust, no waiting. It is red dirt, swamp, clay and\ndust that swirls across their spare reality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and yet the sounds they generated, truths they\nbroiled and presence they offered was every bit as big as Band of Joy.\n\nMore moonshine than brandy, but every bit as polished, NMAS offered a glimpse into the\nhaunted places that gave birth to much of what fuels Band of Joy. Soul-scraping musicianship\nand singing creates that turpentined truth that shakes you, but leaves you lighter for the\nexperience. A purgative of utterly enjoyable effect.\n\n&quot;About the Artists Den&quot;\n\nSince its launch on U.S. public television in 2009, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive from the Artists DenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ created by\nMark Lieberman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ has become a three-time NY Emmy-nominated series and has expanded\nwith international distribution by Shine International to include A&amp;E in Europe, Turner\nBroadcasting in Latin America and multiple online outlets such as Hulu, Vevo and Pandora.\nPast artists include Ringo Starr, Alanis Morissette, The Black Crowes, Tori Amos, Ben\nHarper, Regina Spektor, Corinne Bailey Rae and David Gray.\n\nInterviews at each show are conducted by noted music critic Alan Light, the Artists DenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nDirector of Programming.
