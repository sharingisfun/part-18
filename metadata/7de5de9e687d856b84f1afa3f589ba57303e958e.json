You can not control your subjects directly; instead you focus on city-building, resource management, diplomacy, heroes, magic and other things a\r\ntypical king deals with on a daily basis.\r\nThe game is very flexible: you can build up a powerful ream and rule the lands with an iron grip, or establish a humble fishermen's village. Or create a trading empire. Or found a small, bur well-defended outpost or raider's camp. Or become a host of a wizard's manor.\r\nAll characters, from a hauler to a hero have their own minds and behavior patterns. Sometimes it is interesting just to watch people scurry about minding their own business","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de5de9e687d856b84f1afa3f589ba57303e958e","amp;dn":"Hearthlands+v0.8.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de5de9e687d856b84f1afa3f589ba57303e958e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,229,222,158,104,125,133,107,132,241,175,163,245,137,186,87,48,62,149,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
