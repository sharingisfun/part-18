It debuted on ABC on October 23, 2011. The series revolves around a bail bond agent (Jennifer Morrison) and her son (Jared S. Gilmore) who are about to discover that a New England town, aptly titled Storybrooke, Maine, is actually a remnant of a parallel world that was cursed by the Evil Queen/Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla) from the fairy tale Snow White and that all the characters from the fairy tales have no memories of who they were, including the parents of the bail bond agent, Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince &quot;Charming&quot; James/David Nolan (Josh Dallas), who sent her away so she can save their world and break the curse. On May 10, 2012, ABC renewed the show for a second season.\n\nFormatted to work on iPods.\n\n101 - Pilot ............................ 43:46\n102 - The Thing You Love the Most ...... 42:42\t\n103 - Snow Falls ....................... 43:17\n104 - The Price of Gold ................ 42:59\n105 - That Still Small Voice ........... 43:11\n106 - The Shepherd ..................... 43:15\n107 - The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter ..... 43:16\n108 - Desperate Souls .................. 43:24\n109 - True North ....................... 43:21\n110 - 7:15 A.M. ........................ 43:31\n111 - Fruit of the Poisonous Tree ...... 43:18\n112 - Skin Deep ........................ 43:18\n113 - What Happened to Frederick ....... 43:19\n114 - Dreamy ........................... 43:14\n115 - Red Handed ....................... 43:06\n116 - Heart of Darkness ................ 43:09\n117 - Hat Trick ........................ 42:21\n118 - Stable Boy ....................... 43:08\n119 - The Return ....................... 43:22\n120 - The Stranger ..................... 43:18\n121 - An Apple Red as Blood ............ 43:21\n122 - A Land Without Magic ............. 43:11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64478f4e3148f834ebf8256cd1c09d274a4f5c2e","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+A+Time+Season+1+-+iPod+Compatible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64478f4e3148f834ebf8256cd1c09d274a4f5c2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,71,143,78,49,72,248,52,235,248,37,108,209,192,157,39,74,79,92,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
