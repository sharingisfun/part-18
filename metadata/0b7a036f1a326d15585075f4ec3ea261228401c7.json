The project which could be our final act could also be an impossible dream: creating a starship to take a few hundred survivors on an epic journey to a new world.\r\n\r\nAs the waters rise, as savage wars are fought over the remaining high ground, the work goes on. Those who will live, of the billions who will die, are chosen. Families are torn apart and the resources of our drowning world are marshalled for one last gamble.\r\n\r\nArk is the story of three women, Grace, Venus and Holle, and their part in humanity's struggle to reach a new home. For the few survivors, the day of the launch will be only the beginning of the nightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7a036f1a326d15585075f4ec3ea261228401c7","amp;dn":"Stephen+Baxter+-+Ark+%28Flood+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7a036f1a326d15585075f4ec3ea261228401c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,122,3,111,26,50,109,21,88,80,117,244,236,62,162,97,34,132,1,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
