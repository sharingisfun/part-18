Wright has written with extreme clarity. He doesnÃƒâ€š't waste words or indulge in scholarly &quot;overkill. 2. He has done a good job of relating musical forms and styles to popular music forms. Of particular note are the examples of the Sting rondo and Elton JohnÃƒâ€š's use of basso ostinato (would it be possible to have those pieces included on the CDs? I fear that I donÃƒâ€š't own either of them). 3. The introductory CD contains the best examples of musical instruments, musical element and textures and forms that IÃƒâ€š've ever heard.&quot;\n\n&quot;The new layout with more, shorter chapters is an improvement] in that it does break up the longer chapters; it presents less of an apparent obstacle for studentsÃƒâ€š--which is excellent!&quot;\n\n&quot;[for part openers with timelines] Good idea Ãƒâ€š- with what is happening in the world at that time Ãƒâ€š- so that the music is put into context for the students.&quot;\n\n&quot;[On LISTENING TO WESTERN MUSIC] Thank you for considering this. I teach an entirely separate course on non-Western music so I have no use for any of the world music contentÃƒâ€š--also there simply isnÃƒâ€š't time in 15 weeks to cover even all of the art music.&quot; --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41233c181f603cfe947050ee86c74fd949373c7b","amp;dn":"Listening+to+Western+Music+%286e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41233c181f603cfe947050ee86c74fd949373c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,35,60,24,31,96,60,254,148,112,80,238,134,199,79,217,73,55,60,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
