The volume includes all the significant photographs in the album, compiled by Sir David Brewster, an important early patron of photography. Photographs by William Henry Fox Talbot, the inventor of negative-positive paper photography, are included, as well as works by other photographers who improved upon TalbotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invention. The text discusses the context in which the album was compiled, the personalities of the photographers, and the groups of specific images that it contains. Numerous comparative illustrations are included, as well as a checklist of all photographic images, a bibliography, and an index of all proper names and place names.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:246bc863f9ec31747c81e4be4c01c0210f0e23a1","amp;dn":"Disciples+of+Light+-+Photographs+in+the+Brewster+Album+%28Art+Eboo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"246bc863f9ec31747c81e4be4c01c0210f0e23a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,107,200,99,249,236,49,116,124,129,228,190,76,1,192,33,15,14,35,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
