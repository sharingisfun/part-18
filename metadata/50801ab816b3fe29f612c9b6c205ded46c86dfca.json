The band's name is the Icelandic word for crepuscular rays.SÃƒÂ³lstafir were formed by 3 friends, AÃƒÂ°albjÃƒÂ¶rn Tryggvason, HalldÃƒÂ³r Einarsson and GuÃƒÂ°mundur Ãƒâ€œli PÃƒÂ¡lmason in January 1995. Later that year, the band recorded itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first demo tape Ãƒï¿½ NorÃƒÂ°ri and at the end of the year recorded their second demo, Til Valhallar. Til Valhallar was never released as a demo, and four of the six songs were released as an EP by View Beyond Records. It was later re-released in 2002 with all six songs.\nIn 1999 SÃƒÂ³lstafir entered the studio to record their debut full length album. By that time HalldÃƒÂ³r had left the band and in 1997 and 1998 SÃƒÂ³lstafir released two promos as a two piece. For the recording of the debut full length SÃƒÂ³lstafir recruited Svavar Austmann as HalldÃƒÂ³rÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s replacement. Although the recording of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒï¿½ BlÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ°i og AndaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ had started in 1999 the album was not released until 2002, due to endless delays and mishaps, the band truly believed they were cursed. In the meantime SÃƒÂ³lstafir started playing live shows in Iceland, and for that had added a second guitar player, SÃƒÂ¦ÃƒÂ¾ÃƒÂ³r MarÃƒÂ­us SÃƒÂ¦ÃƒÂ¾ÃƒÂ³rsson. So for the first time as a four piece, SÃƒÂ³lstafir recorded a new demo in 2002, eventually releasing 3 songs as Black Death: The EP.\nIn 2004 the band began working on the follow up to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒï¿½ BlÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ°i og AndaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on their own with the help of a good friend. Although SÃƒÂ³lstafir were becoming a well known name in the European metal underground the band found themselves without a recording label. Thus, the band decided to release 3 of the songs from the album as a limited edition promo to send around to labels. This, and a gig in Denmark (the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first outside of Iceland) ensured the band a deal with Spinefarm Records.\nSÃƒÂ³lstafir released Ã¢â‚¬Å“Masterpiece of BitternessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ through Spinefarm in 2005. The album got exceptionally good reviews almost everywhere and the band kept on making a really good name for themselves with really powerful live performances.\n\n               \n\n In December 2007 the band traveled to GÃƒÂ¶teborg, Sweden to record their third full length, Ã¢â‚¬Å“KÃƒÂ¶ld.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“KÃƒÂ¶ldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released in early 2009 and like Ã¢â‚¬Å“MasterpieceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it not only got exceptionally good reviews, but most critics also had a hard time putting SÃƒÂ³lstafirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music into a specific genre. Descriptions like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sounds Like The Hellacopters if they went to art school and did a lot of ValiumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Imagine if Nachtmystium, Alice In Chains, and Neurosis got hammered while listening to EntombedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DCLXVI - To Ride, Shoot Straight, and Speak The Truth - it would sound something like thisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sigur RÃƒÂ³s goes metal!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were becoming really common\n\nThis contains the album KÃƒÂ¶ld\nTracklist:\n1. 78 Days in the Desert 8:34\n2.
