Dealing with their newly acquired fame and fortune is one thing; dealing with Julian is quite another. His sudden and unexpected metamorphosis from the shy and timid creature they have known all their lives into a surprisingly charismatic public speaker and global superstar takes everyone aback, and when Julian sets off on a very public crusade to replace faith and bigotry with reason and compassion, he raises more than just a few eyebrows. He raises hell, and his friends are no longer having any of it.\n\nMeanwhile at the Vatican, a former televangelist is elected Pope. Hell-bent on transforming the Church into a modern, Ã¢â‚¬ËœhipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ institution, Pius XIII is giving his PR advisor a headache or two. Intrigued by JulianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radical way of inspiring some people while antagonizing others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including his own friends Ã¢â‚¬â€œ simply by preaching love and understanding, the new pope canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but wonder where he heard that storyline before. They say God has a plan for every man, but this man has a plan of his own - and it involves a teenage atheist pop star.\n\nIDOLISM is a delightful, quirky romp for the young adult religious skeptic, taking a tongue-in-cheek look the differences and similarities between religion and stardom. \n\nepub - 399KB\nmobi - 1.42MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06773915de74c5fb4a1ce4e9ebaadf26374ed467","amp;dn":"Idolism+%28atheist+novel%29+%5Bepub%2C+mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06773915de74c5fb4a1ce4e9ebaadf26374ed467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,119,57,21,222,116,197,251,74,28,228,233,235,170,223,38,55,78,212,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
