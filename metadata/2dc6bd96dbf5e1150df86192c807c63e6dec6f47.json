This causes him to turn into a zombie, and kill off his friends. They must band together to try and survive being massacred\n\nWithin the Woods is a 1978 short film directed by Sam Raimi. Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film Clockwork, deciding to produce a &quot;prototype&quot; horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his friends Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as the two protagonists and produced the film for $1600. Shot on location in a remote cabin in the woods, production was a difficult process because of the low budget. Several of the special effects presented in the film were done in a severely low budget manner, some of which were improvised on set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dc6bd96dbf5e1150df86192c807c63e6dec6f47","amp;dn":"Within+The+Woods+Evil+Dead+Prequel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dc6bd96dbf5e1150df86192c807c63e6dec6f47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,198,189,150,219,245,225,21,13,248,97,146,200,7,198,62,109,236,111,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
