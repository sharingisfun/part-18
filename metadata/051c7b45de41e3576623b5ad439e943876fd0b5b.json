VA - Rock Instrumental Classics, Vol.3 (The &amp;#039;70s)\n\nRhino&amp;#039;s third rock instrumentals volume covers the &amp;#039;70s, a period that found disco, funk, and fusion joining the formula alongside one-shot concept works and the usual novelty numbers. The 18 cuts include stomping club/funk from B.T. Express and Brass Construction, King Curtis&amp;#039; updated honking sax cover of Led Zeppelin&amp;#039;s &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; very stylized material from the Electric Light Orchestra and Deodato, and memorable outings by Billy Preston, Edgar Winter, and AWB. Gary Glitter, Edgar Winter, the Chakachas, Rhinoceros, and Van McCoy offer lighter pop variations, and &quot;Sun Goddess&quot; was a musically adventurous excursion into fusion by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.

VA - Rock Instrumental Classics, Vol.4 (Soul)\n\nWhile the material on volume four of Rhino&amp;#039;s rock instrumentals set chronologically preceded what was on the third volume, no soul, R&amp;B, or even soul-jazz and funk fan should mind these 18 genuine classics, including two superb numbers from Booker T. and the MGs, seminal tracks by the Mar-Keys, Bar-Kays, and Cannonball Adderley, and great Latin tunes from Ray Barretto and Mongo Santamaria. There&amp;#039;s absolutely no fluff, and the presence on CD of rare cuts like the Young Holt Trio&amp;#039;s &quot;Wack Wack&quot; and Alvin Cash &amp; the Crawlers&amp;#039; &quot;Twine Time&quot; is most welcome.\n\n\n01.
