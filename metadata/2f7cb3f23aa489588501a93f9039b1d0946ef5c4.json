For the first time, designers and photographers were able to perform image editing tasks without resorting to high end equipment that cost double the amount. It started a revolution that continues to this day. Over the years there have been many other programs that perform similar functions to Photoshop. However, AdobeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s image editing software has seen off all comers and after 21 years, it is still the industry standard program in its field.\n\nPlease Seed after You download","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f7cb3f23aa489588501a93f9039b1d0946ef5c4","amp;dn":"An+introduction+to+Adobe+Photoshop+PDF%7BTRRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f7cb3f23aa489588501a93f9039b1d0946ef5c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,124,179,242,58,164,137,88,133,1,169,63,144,57,177,208,148,110,245,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
