Kausal, IV\n2001, 148pp\nDefense Acquisition University Press\nISBN: 1-893833-04-7\n[color=silver](A DAU Press production created November 2001 using PageMaker 6.52 and Acrobat Distiller 4.0)\n\nOver the last several decades a significant body of writings has appeared on &quot;management&quot;; the reading public has shown a thirst for new management concepts, ideas, or trends that will make them better managers in their chosen field(s).\n\nWithin the Department of Defense (DoD) and the three military departments Ã¢â‚¬â€Army, Navy, Air ForceÃ¢â‚¬â€ billions of dollars are spent to develop, produce, field, and operate military weapon systems. The hub of that activity, at least in the Air Force, is the System Program Office (SPO). Little has been written on the management activities of a program office.\n\nPeter Drucker has said, &quot;Size determines complexity&quot;. If he was correct, one of the most difficult management tasks may be the management of an acquisition program. For an acquisition system is large, with many players, and many agendas; just within DoD competing interests exist between the Services, and internally the Air Force struggles with competing interests. Laws, rules, and regulations govern the process, but technical difficulties arise in any program regardless of its lifespan. Problems occur whether developing new systems or just keeping old systems up-to-date. And finally finding oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way through the maze of laws, organizations, and politics of the Pentagon and its acquisition system is a real challenge.\n\nThis case study looks at the &quot;hub&quot; of activity in the acquisition business: the System Program Office (SPO). This is a transnational comparison. The approach is to examine, compare, and contrast the management methods, processes, and procedures of the French DÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©gation GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale pour lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ArmementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (DGA) Mirage Aircraft Program and the United States Air ForceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s F-16 Fighter Aircraft Program for insight into more efficient management practices. These are not idle questions reserved for academia, but rather real issues to be faced by acquisition public decision makers. What is the most effective and cost efficient structure for managing a program office? What tasks and responsibilities does a program office perform? Can, and should, some of these be accomplished by industry? The bottom line question is how to deliver a complex weapon system such as the Mirage or F-16 at a cost the government and the public can afford and that is militarily effective.\n\nIn France and the United States, defense is big business and each country continues to allocate significant amounts of their national resources for the security of the nation. With competing demands for newer and better weapon systems versus domestic needs, acquisition organizations from both countries will keep the spotlight on cutting the costs of new and existing weapons.\n\nOrganizations mold behavior, but the organizations were created for a variety of reasons to include ideology, cultural constraints, and history. What is the effect of political and bureaucratic institutions on the acquisition system? What special problems arise from public accountability and political control? Within this environment, the business of meeting the future armament needs of the military continues, and our need to know how they are to continue doing it remains.\n\nContent headings/sub-headings include...\n-------------------------\n\tThe French National Milieu\n\tPolitical-Military Environment\n\tMinistry of Defense\n\tDÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©gation GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale pour lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ArmementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (DGA) Role &amp; Organization\n\tAcquisition Program Management \n\tPlanning, Programming, and Budgeting\n\tProcurement/Contracting System\n\tDGA Workforce Fonctionaires &amp; Education\n\tCollaboration and Armament Sales\n\n\tThe US National Milieu]\n\tPolitical Military Environment \n\tCongressional Involvement in Acquisition\n\tDoD Acquisition Structure &amp; AF Materiel Command\n\tDevelopment of Military Requirements \n\tPlanning, Programming, and Budgeting System\n\tAcquisition Management System\n\tIntegrated Product Teams\n\tProcurement/Contracting System\n\tDefense Acquisition and Technology Workforce\n\tCooperation and Armament Sales\n\n\tIndustry-Gov't Relationships\n\tUS Defense Industrial Base &amp; Trends\n\tFrench Defense Industrial Base\n\tRestructuring &amp; Globalization of French Industry\n\t\n\tFrench Mirage 2000 Program\n\tProgram History\n\tMirage Aircraft\n\tAir Force Combat Aircraft Division\n\tTactical Missiles Program Division\n\tIntegrated Program Teams\n\tProgram Managers and Personnel (Education &amp; Experience)\n\tManagement Practices (Decision, Reform, Outside Influences, Config Control, Budgeting)\n\tBusiness Arrangements\n\n\tUnited States F-16 Program\n\tProgram History\n\tFighting Falcon Aircraft\n\tAeronautical Systems Center &amp; Ogden Air Logistics Center\n\tF-16 System Program Office Groups\n\tIntegrated Program Team\n\tProgram Managers and Personnel (Functional Discipline, Education, Training, Turnover)\n\tManagement Practices (Decision, Reform, Foreign Mil Sales, Outside Influence, Config Updates)\n\tBusiness Arrangements\n\n\tContrast Of Program Management\n\tPolitics and Armament Acquisition\n\tBreadth of Defense Activities\n\tWay of Doing Business\n\tDecision Making\n\tDifference in Management Styles\n\n\n==========\nPlease be advised that I have a very slow connection (c.30-60kB up), as well as sporadically connectable state... so things might take awhile to grab from me. \n~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdb3636d5d9331d008cd755f16357f23329c1f81","amp;dn":"The+Falcon+and+the+Mirage+%282001%29+%5BOCR+PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdb3636d5d9331d008cd755f16357f23329c1f81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,179,99,109,93,147,49,208,8,205,117,95,22,53,127,35,50,156,31,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
