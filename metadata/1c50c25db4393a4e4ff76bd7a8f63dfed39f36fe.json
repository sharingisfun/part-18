All files has been scanned on virustotal.com\n\n============\nInstructions\n============\n\n1. Just install program.\n\nThat's all. You have full Teleport Ultra v1.70.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nTeleport Pro's big brother, Teleport Ultra, has Pro's intuitive interface and easy-to-use project-based design -- but it also has the ability to scan up to 260,000 addresses in a single project. Like Teleport Pro, Teleport Ultra can handle multiple servers in a single project, dramatically improving its throughput. Its larger database, however, allows it to handle much larger websites and more servers, enabling you to download much more information in a single project. (And if you need even larger capacity, try Teleport VLX.)\n\nTeleport Ultra is also an enhanced capability webspider, having exploration, filtering, and rewriting capabilities that Teleport Pro lacks. Its enhanced abilities allow you to:\n* Use regular expressions to specify included as well as excluded areas to crawl\n* Specify domain aliases for crawling servers with multiple names\n* Borrow the browser's cookie cache, letting you perform complex authentication with your browser, and then crawl with Teleport\n* Inject custom HTTP headers into server requests\n* Synchronize your offline copy so that old files and orphans are automatically removed\n* Use customizable messages when rewriting links to unretrieved files\n* Control HTML markup and inject meta tags with original URL and retrieval date/time stamps\n* Can crawl HTTPS (secure) servers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c50c25db4393a4e4ff76bd7a8f63dfed39f36fe","amp;dn":"Teleport+Ultra+v1.70+Retail+Cracked-BRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c50c25db4393a4e4ff76bd7a8f63dfed39f36fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,80,194,93,180,57,58,78,79,247,107,215,168,246,61,254,211,159,54,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
