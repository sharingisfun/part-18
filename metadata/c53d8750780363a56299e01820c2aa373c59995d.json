Found this cam copy floating around, its the best quality I've found with Andrew Rannells. This is not shot by myself. Pretty bummed I didn't see it with the original cast, but the current touring cast put on a pretty good show when I saw it live. \n\nAnyway Enjoy.   A6V3 Sorry its not better.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a religious satire musical with book, lyrics, and music by Trey Parker, Robert Lopez, and Matt Stone. Best known for creating the animated comedy South Park, Parker and Stone co-created the music with Lopez, a co-composer/co-lyricist of Avenue Q.\n\nThe Book of Mormon tells the story of two young Mormon missionaries sent to a remote village in northern Uganda, where a brutal warlord is threatening the local population. NaÃƒÂ¯ve and optimistic, the two missionaries try to share the Book of Mormon, one of their scripturesÃ¢â‚¬â€which only one of them has readÃ¢â‚¬â€but have trouble connecting with the locals, who are more worried about war, famine, poverty, and AIDS than about religion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c53d8750780363a56299e01820c2aa373c59995d","amp;dn":"Book.Of.Mormon.Original.Cast.Meh.Quality.CroBar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c53d8750780363a56299e01820c2aa373c59995d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,61,135,80,120,3,99,165,98,153,224,24,32,194,170,55,60,89,153,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
