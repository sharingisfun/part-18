The band formed in late 2006. Their radio-ready sound of blended guitars and vocal harmonies has been classified by some as nu metal with classic commercial radio sensibility.\n\nIn just two short years, Seasons After has performed on The Vans Warped Tour, Taste of Chaos, the Jagermeister Music Tour and The Rock Star Energy Drink Mayhem Festival. The band tours extensively and recently signed to Dirtbag Music Records. Their fan base continues to grow exponentially as they continue to tour with plans for a full nationwide tour coming in the Fall of 2009.\n\n&quot;Through Tomorrow&quot; embarks audiences on a journey through life's toils and snares, at times lifting the listener up with lyrics like, &quot;Stand for something now, don't fall for anything&quot; and then sends listeners crashing back down to somber reality as told in the lyrics of &quot;The Worst Parts&quot;. In all, &quot;Through Tomorrow&quot; is a feast of crunchy guitar riffs, huge commercial radio hooks and heavy bass and drum patterns blended with harmonic vocals\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n\t\n1.
