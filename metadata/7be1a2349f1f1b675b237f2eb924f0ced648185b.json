A stranger will greet you by name and invite you inside. At first, you wonâ€™t want to leave. Later, youâ€™ll find that you canâ€™t. Every nine years, the houseâ€™s residentsâ€”an odd brother and sisterâ€”extend a unique invitation to someone whoâ€™s different or lonely: a precocious teenager, a recently divorced policeman, a shy college student. But what really goes on inside Slade House? For those who find out, itâ€™s already too late. . . .\r\n\r\nSpanning five decades, from the last days of the 1970s to the present, leaping genres, and barreling toward an astonishing conclusion, this intricately woven novel will pull you into a reality-warping new vision of the haunted house storyâ€”as only David Mitchell could imagine it.\r\n\r\nPRAISE\r\nâ€œPlants died, milk curdled, and my children went slightly feral as I succumbed to the creepy magic of David Mitchellâ€™s Slade House. Itâ€™s a wildly inventive, chilling, andâ€”for all its otherworldlinessâ€”wonderfully human haunted house story. I plan to return to its clutches quite often.â€â€”Gillian Flynn, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Gone Girl and The Grownup \r\n\r\nâ€œI gulped down this novel in a single evening. Intricately connected to David Mitchellâ€™s previous books, this compact fantasy burns with classic Mitchellian energy. Painstakingly imagined and crackling with narrative velocity, itâ€™s a Dracula for the new millennium, a Hansel and Gretel for grownups, a reminder of how much fun fiction can be.â€â€”Anthony Doerr, author of All the Light We Cannot See, winner of the Pulitzer Prize\r\n\r\nâ€œDavid Mitchell doesnâ€™t break rules so much as prove them inhibitors to lively, intelligent fiction. Slade House is a fractal offshoot of his remarkable The Bone Clocks, an eerie haunted-house tale that takes as much from quantum mechanics as from traditional supernatural lore, a spellbinding chiller about an unnatural greed for life and the arrogance of power.â€â€”Dean Koontz, #1 New York Times bestselling author\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat canâ€™t David Mitchell do? Slade House is a page-burning, read-in-one-sitting, at times terrifying novel that does for the haunted-house story what Henry James did for the ghost story in The Turn of the Screw.â€â€”Adam Johnson, author of Fortune Smiles and The Orphan Masterâ€™s Son, winner of the Pulitzer Prize\r\n\r\nâ€œDavid Mitchell has long been acknowledged as one of the finestâ€”if not the finestâ€”literary minds of his generation, but heâ€™s also one of the most suspenseful, and he proves it in every gripping, vertiginous setpiece.â€â€”Joe Hill, New York Times bestselling author of NOS4A2 and Horns\r\n\r\nâ€œSharp, fast, flat-out spooky, Slade House is such a hypnotic read that you are likely to miss your subway stop in order to keep reading. And by you, I mean me.â€â€”Daniel Handler, New York Times bestselling author of the Lemony Snicket series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7be1a2349f1f1b675b237f2eb924f0ced648185b","amp;dn":"Slade+House+-+David+Mitchell.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7be1a2349f1f1b675b237f2eb924f0ced648185b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,225,162,52,159,31,27,103,91,35,127,46,185,36,240,206,214,72,24,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
