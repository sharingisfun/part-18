He dreams of a life where he can fly away from technology and overpowering bureaucracy, and spend eternity with the woman of his dreams. While trying to rectify the wrongful arrest of one Harry Buttle, Lowry meets the woman he is always chasing in his dreams, Jill Layton. Meanwhile, the bureaucracy has fingered him responsible for a rash of terrorist bombings, and both Sam and Jill's lives are put in danger.\n\n\n\nRELEASE DATE....: 07/21/2011\nTHEATRE DATE....: 1985\n\nGENRE...........: Drama | Fantasy | Sci-Fi\nSOURCE .........: Brazil 1985 1080p Blu-ray AVC DTS-HD MA 5.1\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 L4.1 High @ 14796 Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 23.976 fps\nAUDiO 1.........: English DTS HDMA CORE 5.1 1509Kbps\nRUNTiME.........: 2:11:40 (h:m:s)\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.85 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1920 X 1040\nSUBTiTLES.......: N/A\nFilE SiZE.......: 15G\nENCODER.........: dingxwsimon@CHD\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13b9abfc26004aaea79a0a218bbee69b96641e22","amp;dn":"Brazil.1985.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-CHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13b9abfc26004aaea79a0a218bbee69b96641e22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,185,171,252,38,0,74,174,167,154,10,33,139,190,230,155,150,100,30,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
