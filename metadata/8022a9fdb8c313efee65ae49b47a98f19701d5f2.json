Written in 1999, Auerbach's 24 Preludes for Violin and Piano amply showcase her stylistic leanings and wide emotional range. Clearly, she's imbibed from the Shostakovich/Schnittke watering hole, as we hear in the frequent sparse textures in extreme registers, petulant dynamic shifts, obsessive pedal points, and caustic, folk-oriented tunes. Auerbach also has figured out what makes Astor Piazzolla tick, and manages to personalize his sultry harmonic idiom. Not only do I want to hear more of Auerbach's music, but I also hope BIS plans to take advantage of her wonderful piano playing on future releases. Enthusiastically recommended.\n---Jed Distler, ClassicsToday.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8022a9fdb8c313efee65ae49b47a98f19701d5f2","amp;dn":"Lera+Auerbach+24+Preludes+for+Violin+and+Piano%2C+Gluzman+Yoffe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8022a9fdb8c313efee65ae49b47a98f19701d5f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,34,169,253,184,195,19,239,238,101,174,73,180,122,152,241,151,1,213,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
