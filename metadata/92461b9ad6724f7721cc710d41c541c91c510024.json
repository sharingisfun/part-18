This collection of essays comprehensively examines children's ideas about death, both biological and religious. Written by specialists from developmental psychology, pediatrics, philosophy, anthropology and legal studies, it offers a truly interdisciplinary approach to the topic. The volume examines different conceptions of death and their impact on children's cognitive and emotional development and will be useful for courses in developmental psychology, clinical psychology and certain education courses, as well as philosophy classes - especially in ethics and epistemology. This collection will be of particular interest to researchers and practitioners in psychology, medical workers and educators - both parents and teachers. \n\n\nHardcover: 202 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (April 25, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521194598\nISBN-13: 978-0521194594 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92461b9ad6724f7721cc710d41c541c91c510024","amp;dn":"Children%27s+Understanding+of+Death+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92461b9ad6724f7721cc710d41c541c91c510024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,70,27,154,214,114,79,119,33,204,113,13,65,197,65,201,28,81,0,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
