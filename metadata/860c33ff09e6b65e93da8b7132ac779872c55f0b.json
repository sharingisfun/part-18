A frist rate \nguitarist with a great feel for all kinds of blues, soulful singer, and charismatic performer (though without pretense), Gallagher was, for some reason, a non-seller. This album was the first Gallagher cut-out I bought and when the CD was released I didn't flinch at all at paying full price because this is some of the best live blues and rock on earth. After a perfunctory introduction and some enthusiastic applause from what sounds like a small audience, Gallagher rips into the first notes of his cover of Junior Wells' &quot;Messin' With The Kid&quot; and never lets up. His acoustic blues are just as impassioned as his electric rock; his performance of &quot;Pistol Slapper Blues&quot; is actually reminiscent of Blind Boy Fuller's, complete with fine Piedmont style fingerpicking and &quot;Going To My Hometown&quot; features mandolin and audience participation. Bassist Gerry McAvoy and drummer Wilgar Campbell fir perfectly with him. ther challenge and push him without getting in the way. Campbell's fills never intrude on the music, rather they help to fill the background and tend to keep the intensity up. Gallagher's own virtuosity never seems to exist for its own sake; his ego seems totally subsumed in the music. This is the mark of a true musician. The production is competent without being the least bit slick and there are just enough wrong notes to indicate a minimum of overdubbing. This is a great live rock album, doubtless one of the best, and an object lesson for many musicians with great chops and little maturity. Don't miss it.&quot; \n\nMore info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Gallagher\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
