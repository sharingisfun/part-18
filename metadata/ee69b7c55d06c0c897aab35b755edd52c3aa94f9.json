The bitter mothers played by Takamine in both this film and Immortal Love defy warmongers and husbands. In the latter, a woman shouts, &quot;Go ahead, hate me! I've suffered and I can suffer more!&quot; It's not masochism so much as a stubborn pride in how much abuse her decent and pure heart can take. \n\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n\nDVDRIP\n\nduration 1:52:39 \nVidÃƒÂ©o : 952 Mo, \n1181 Kbps, \n25.0 fps, \nres. 576*256 (2.21:1), \nXVID \nAudio : 48 Mo, \n59 Kbps, \n48000 Hz, \n1 channel, \n0x55 = Lame MP3, SupportÃƒÂ©","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee69b7c55d06c0c897aab35b755edd52c3aa94f9","amp;dn":"The+River+Fuefuki+%28Keisuke+Kinoshita%2C+1960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee69b7c55d06c0c897aab35b755edd52c3aa94f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,105,183,197,93,6,192,200,151,170,179,91,117,94,221,82,195,170,148,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
