Legrand, Christiane SÃ©nÃ©maud (Taylor&amp;Francis, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nIn recent years an increasing interest has been devoted to nanostructured composites. This attention is largely due to exciting possible applications ranging from new catalysts to the preparation of nanocomposites ceramics, with significant improvements in their properties.\r\n\r\nThis book provides a comprehensive survey of French contributions to the synthesis of nano-sized powders and the production of nano-structures Silicon-Based composites by liquid-phase sintering using nano-sized powders where interfaces play a decisive role for the evolution of properties. It focuses on a series of identical materials including preparation conditions, physical and chemical analysis, preparation and mechanical property determination of silicon-based nanocomposites. \r\n\r\nEdited by well-known experts in the field of research, the content of Nanostructured Silicon-Based Powders and Composites is very detailed and strongly interdisciplinary and will be valuable for a broad readership in research and education","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0614ed6c4993f302eb5008b8f41076680b25bae7","amp;dn":"Nanostructured+Silicon-based+Powders+and+Composites","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0614ed6c4993f302eb5008b8f41076680b25bae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,20,237,108,73,147,243,2,235,80,8,184,244,16,118,104,11,37,186,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
