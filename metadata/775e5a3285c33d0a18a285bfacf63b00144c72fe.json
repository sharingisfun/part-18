It was released as the first single from their album Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates in 1976. The song was the group's first Top 10 hit in the US, reaching number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Thirty-three years later, country music singer Jimmy Wayne released a cover version as a single, with backing vocals from the duo.\n\n&quot;Sara Smile&quot; was the first single release from Hall &amp; Oates' 1976 self-titled album for RCA Records. Co-written by both halves of the duo, it was their breakthrough single, with a #4 peak on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in 1976. It was written about Hall's girlfriend, Sara Allen. The song is also considered a standard of seventies blue-eyed soul.\n\nNathan Brackett and Christian Hoard, in the Rolling Stone album guide, referred to the song as a &quot;love bead ballad,&quot; and Steve Pond of the Los Angeles Times cited it as an example of the duo's R&amp;B influences. Because of its chart success, &quot;Sara Smile&quot; promped a re-release of the duo's previous single, &quot;She's Gone.&quot;[\n\n&quot;Sara Smile&quot; was the duo's first Top Ten hit, reaching #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at #23 on Hot Soul Singles (now Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs) and #18 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts. The song also earned a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nDaryl Hall &amp; John Oates is a 1975 album by Hall &amp; Oates. This self titled album is sometimes labeled The Silver Album because of its metallic glam-rock style cover. In 2000 Buddah Records re-released the album with two bonus tracks (&quot;What's Important to Me&quot; and &quot;Ice&quot;). When making the album cover, Hall &amp; Oates were so heavily made-up that Hall ended up looking like a woman.\n\n&quot;Grounds For Separation&quot;, according to Daryl Hall, was going to be used in the Sylvester Stallone movie &quot;Rocky.&quot; Frank Stallone, Sylvester's brother, was in a band with John Oates called Valentine and this connection got them a shot at an appearance on the soundtrack. The movie, however, was slow to get off the ground, and Hall and Oates withdrew the song.\n\n&quot;Grounds For Separation&quot; is also sampled by Kanye West in his song &quot;Fight With The Best.&quot;\n\nGino (The Manager) was about Tommy Mottola, their manager, who later became president of Sony Music.\n\nIn 2009, Sony Music Custom Marketing Group released a triple pack of Hall &amp; Oates albums. Along with this album, the pack included H2O and Ooh Yeah!.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775e5a3285c33d0a18a285bfacf63b00144c72fe","amp;dn":"Hall+%26+Oates+-+Sara+Smile+%28Live-Beat+Club%29++%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775e5a3285c33d0a18a285bfacf63b00144c72fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,94,90,50,133,195,61,10,24,162,133,191,172,246,59,0,20,76,114,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
