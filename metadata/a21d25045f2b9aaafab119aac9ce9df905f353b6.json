One feature in his writing stands out, from his classic Defending the Undefendable to the present. He consistently applies the principles of libertarianism to every situation in a bold and original way. Readers of Toward a Libertarian Society, a collection of his articles from lewrockwell.com, will find this feature abundantly on display.\n\nBlock believes that libertarianism has three components: foreign policy, economic policy, and policies on personal liberties. He devotes a separate part of the book to each of these components.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Block is a resolute non-interventionist. He is an anarchist who rejects the state altogether; but, so long as a state exists, it should confine its foreign policy to defense against invasion. Doing so is in line with the tradition of Washington and John Quincy Adams. In our own day, Ron Paul has been the foremost champion of non-intervention; and Paul has few, if any, more ardent advocates than Walter Block.\n\nIn economic policy, Block defends the free market against all types of interference. One issue especially concerns him: the activities of labor unions. Against union advocates, Block emphasizes that wages depend on workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ marginal productivity. Block is equally decisive in macroeconomics. He calls for the total abolition of the Fed.\n\nBlock, never one to avoid controversy, argues that much in the contemporary feminist movement is antithetical to libertarianism. Readers will learn his views about abortion, stem-cell research, and punishment theory. He is a firm advocate of the possibility and desirability of political secession.\n\nReading Toward a Libertarian Society is the equivalent of a college course in libertarianism, taught by a master teacher.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nWalter Edward Block (born 21 August 1941) is a free market economist and anarcho-capitalist associated with the Austrian School of economics. He earned his PhD in Economics at Columbia University.

Rothbard; Religion, Econonomics, and Social Thought; and Economic Freedom: Toward a Theory of Measurement.\n\nDr. Block has written almost 500 articles for various scholarly refereed journals, and thousands of essays for magazines and newspapers, and is a contributor to such journals as The Review of Austrian Economics, Journal of Libertarian Studies, The Journal of Labor Economics, Cultural Dynamics, and the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics. He is currently a professor and chair of economics, college of business administration, at Loyola University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21d25045f2b9aaafab119aac9ce9df905f353b6","amp;dn":"Toward+a+Libertarian+Society+-+Walter+Block","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21d25045f2b9aaafab119aac9ce9df905f353b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,29,37,4,95,43,154,170,250,177,25,170,201,206,157,249,5,243,83,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
