Amongst this wreckage, two lovers, Evelyn and Gil, find themselves separated by a continent and will do anything to find each other again. But when a strange being named &quot;the Word&quot; turns Evelyn into a champion with an angelic spear, she finds the force of her love for Gil clashing with her newfound power.
