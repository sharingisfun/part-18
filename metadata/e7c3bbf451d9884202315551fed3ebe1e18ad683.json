In 1995 a Gallup poll found that 52 percent of Americans said &quot;the federal government has become so large and powerful that it poses an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens.&quot; Later that year, The Wall Street Journal concurred, saying: &quot;Because of their growing disdain for government, more and more Americans appear to be driftingÃ¢â‚¬â€often unwittinglyÃ¢â‚¬â€toward a libertarian philosophy.&quot; \n\nLibertarianism is hardly new, but its framework for liberty under law and economic progress makes it especially suited for the dynamic new era we are now entering. In the United States, the bureaucratic leviathan is newly threatened by a resurgence of the libertarian ideas upon which the country was founded. We are witnessing a breakdown of all the cherished beliefs of the welfare-warfare state. Americans have seen the failure of big government. Now, in the 1990s, we are ready to apply the lessons of this century to make the next one the century not of the state but of the free individual. \n\nDavid Boaz presents the essential guidebook to the libertarian perspective, detailing its roots, central tenets, solutions to contemporary policy dilemmas, and future in American politics. He confronts head-on the tough questions frequently posed to libertarians: What about inequality? Who protects the environment? What ties people together if they are essentially self-interested? A concluding section, &quot;Are You a Libertarian?&quot; gives readers a chance to explore the substance of their own beliefs. Libertarianism is must reading for understanding one of the most exciting and hopeful movements of our time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c3bbf451d9884202315551fed3ebe1e18ad683","amp;dn":"%5B1997%5D+Libertarianism+-+A+Primer.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c3bbf451d9884202315551fed3ebe1e18ad683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,195,187,244,81,217,136,66,2,49,85,81,254,211,235,225,225,138,214,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
