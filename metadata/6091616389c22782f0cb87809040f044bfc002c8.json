Not bound by a western, Silicon Valley stereotype, this group of courageous and energetic doers has created a global and diverse mix of companies destined to become tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading organizations.\n\nWorthless, Impossible, and Stupid is about how enterprising individuals from around the world see hidden value in situations where others do not, use that perception to develop products and services that people initially donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think they want, and ultimately go on to realize extraordinary value for themselves, their customers, and society as a whole. What these business builders have in common is a contrarian mind-set that allows them to create opportunities and succeed where others see nothing. Amazingly, this process repeats itself in one form or another countless times a day all over the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6091616389c22782f0cb87809040f044bfc002c8","amp;dn":"Worthless%2C+Impossible+and+Stupid+-+How+Contrarian+Entrepreneurs+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6091616389c22782f0cb87809040f044bfc002c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,145,97,99,137,194,39,130,240,203,135,128,144,64,240,68,191,192,2,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
