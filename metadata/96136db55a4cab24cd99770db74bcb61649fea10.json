Rotated and cropped losslessly.\nNotes.txt (which is simply this included in the torrent)\nTrack Listing.nfo.txt\nURL.txt\n\nAn excerpt from AllMusic.com:\n\nAs a rule, tribute records are problematic; there are some tunes that shine, others that are interpreted as if the performer has no idea what the original artist was about. Amazingly, that's not so on Endless Highway: The Music of The Band, despite a wider ranging roster than is usually proffered.

The array here is simply dazzling. ...\n\nThe entire review can be found here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:rtkmikbtbbo9~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:rtkmikbtbbo9~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAt Amazon.com I find three versions of this CD. One, a double CD, I clearly don't have. The third is an import that isn't yet available. This one pictures the same case sticker: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JMJVPY/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JMJVPY/&lt;/a&gt;\nBut shows a different track listing order. I think Amazon.com is wrong, as the tracks on my CD match AllMusic and what was found in the FreeDB database.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. (3:24) Guster - This Wheel's On Fire\n02.
