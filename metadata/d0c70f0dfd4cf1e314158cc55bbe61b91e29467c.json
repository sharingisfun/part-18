Lena Heady plays Jones, obviously the Smart Girl because she is briefly seen wearing glasses. Jones hangs out with Arty Guy Travis and Handsome Rich Guy Derrick, who finances their adventures and has a little bit of a lying habit. The three are all in the same journalism class (acidic monologist Eric Bogosian plays the acidic professor) and decide to start and track a rumor for their term papers. They pick rich and beautiful couple Beau and Naomi (Joshua Jackson and Kate Hudson) as the focus of the rumor, and before you know it their juicy story starts spinning out of control into ugly territory and a truly ludicrous climax. There are attempts at making sledgehammer points about the slippery task of finding Truth, but mostly Gossip is about the guilty pleasure of watching pretty young actors be mean to each other. You'll hate yourself in the morning, but watch it anyway. --Ali Davis\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c70f0dfd4cf1e314158cc55bbe61b91e29467c","amp;dn":"Gossip+-+DVDRip+-+2000+-+Kate+Hudson%2C+James+Marsden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c70f0dfd4cf1e314158cc55bbe61b91e29467c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,199,15,13,253,76,241,227,20,21,140,197,91,190,97,185,30,41,70,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
