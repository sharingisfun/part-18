This recording is from the second Casey era, and does not necessarily reflect opinions of the first Casey era.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nI tried to hit on the highlights of this three-hour special but I found myself just transcribing the entire show. One member of our senior faculty here at the RocketMan Conservatory described this broadcast thusly:\n\n&quot;The original air-date was January 1, 2000, and it came to be known as the 'Y2K' special. It is a compelling look into the news events of the rock and roll era, along with the music that served as background along the way. Casey Kasem delivered it with excellence.&quot;\n\nLaunch Command: &quot;When Ready&quot;\n\n32: Rock Around The Clock - Bill Haley &amp; His Comets\n31: Maybelline - Chuck Berry\n30: Heartbreak Hotel - Elvis Presley\n29: That'll Be The Day - Buddy Holly &amp; The Crickets\n28: My Girl - Temptations\n27: Surfin' USA - Beach Boys\n26: Be My Baby - Ronettes\n25: I Want To Hold Your Hand - Beatles\n24: Positively 4th Street - Bob Dylan\n23: Say It Loud (I'm Black And I'm Proud) - James Brown\n22: I'm A Believer - The Monkees\n21: Respect - Aretha Franklin\n20: White Rabbit - Jefferson Airplane\n19: Let It Be - Beatles\nEXTRA: Your Song - Elton John\n18: It's Too Late - Carole King\n17: Changes - David Bowie\n16: Stayin' Alive - Bee Gees\n15: Show Me The Way - Peter Frampton\n14: Rapper's Delight - Sugarhill Gang\n13: Roxanne - Police\n12: (Just Like) Starting Over - John Lennon\n11: Billie Jean - Michael Jackson\n10: Born In The USA - Bruce Springsteen\nEXTRA: Thriller - Michael Jackson\n9: Like A Virgin - Madonna\n8: When Doves Cry - Prince\n7: Do They Know It's Christmas - Band Aid\n6: We Are The World - USA For Africa\n5: U Can't Touch This - MC Hammer\n4: Come As You Are (Unplugged) - Nirvana\n3: I Will Always Love You - Whitney Houston\nEXTRA: I Will Remember You - Sara  McLachlan\n2: Quit Playing Games (With My Heart) - Backstreet Boys\n1: Livin' La Vida Loca - Ricky Martin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa467a62d8cd2e6b389a0eae70bacf29ce55ba1","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_2000_January_1st_Y2K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa467a62d8cd2e6b389a0eae70bacf29ce55ba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,164,103,166,45,140,210,230,179,137,160,234,231,11,172,242,156,229,91,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
