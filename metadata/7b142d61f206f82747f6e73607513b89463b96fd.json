Enjoy.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n&quot;The 22-minute pilot differs from the comic mainly in that the characters are fleshed out with backstories. Rather than a master of languages, Emperor Zombie is the first of the Screw-On Head&amp;#039;s manservants, who has turned to evil despite the Head&amp;#039;s advice. Out of revenge for his first defeat (which he at one point refers to as a &quot;petty vengeance fetish with [Screw-On Head&amp;#039;s] manservants&quot;) he has killed the seven replacement servants who had served before Mr. Groin in gruesome ways. Zombie&amp;#039;s vampire mistress, now named Patience, is much more talkative; a flashback reveals she was the Screw-On Head&amp;#039;s mortal lover, until snatched from him by a vampire servant of Emperor Zombie. Instead of Doctor Snap, Emperor Zombie&amp;#039;s other servants are a heavily armed monkey and two elderly women, one a werewolf and the other a cannibal who apparently takes over Doctor Snap&amp;#039;s role as scientist as well.\n\nOn July 12th 2006, The Amazing Screw-On Head TV pilot was aired online at scifi.com with a survey to decide whether or not the show goes to series. According to Mike Mignola on the November 29th 2006 Fanboy Radio podcast, the series was not picked up by the Sci-Fi Channel.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b142d61f206f82747f6e73607513b89463b96fd","amp;dn":"Amazing+Screw-On+Head+%5BDVD+RIP%5D+%5BDivX%5D+-+B+L+A+C+K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b142d61f206f82747f6e73607513b89463b96fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,20,45,97,242,6,248,39,71,246,231,54,7,81,59,137,70,59,150,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
