One minute I hear how none of them are signing new acts due to the state of the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Music BusinessÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ (if you can still call it that) these days, and then I find myself getting pummeled by this complete band of newbies out of an unlikely place like Omaha, NebraskaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â with a major label backing.  All I can say is ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Kudos to the suits upstairs at AtlanticÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶!  Not since they signed Shinedown have we heard such a dirty force of high-octane Rock-N-Roll complete with well-written hooks that pack more heat than the fuzz at a 50-Cent concert!\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Do I                                                 [03:26]\n02.Get paid                                             [02:58]\n03.Put down the drink                                   [03:41]\n04.Bounce                                               [03:03]\n05.A place to fall                                      [03:53]\n06.Beg                                                  [03:57]\n07.Tonight                                              [03:18]\n08.Pride                                                [03:43]\n09.Original sin                                         [03:10]\n10.Don't forget about me                                [03:46]\n____\n\n34:55 min\n 61,1 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
