This week the number of disco records in the countdown hits a new high. We have 15 out of the 40 and this is one of them. At number 5, three weeks in a row, Peaches &amp; Herb and 'Shake Your Groove Thing'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nPremiere Radio Networks did a bad edit on the first verse of &quot;Big Shot&quot; (by Billy Joel at number 14). As a RocketMan extra (to make up for it because they hurt my feelings), I've included some video from his January, 1983 HBO special to make up for it. Also, I didn't see this video torrented anywhere so if you want a copy, I just uploaded it as an AVI and an ISO.\n\nPeaches &amp; Herb have the highest debut song of the week with &quot;Reunited&quot; (at number 26) but the band Wings debuts their song &quot;Good Night Tonight&quot; on the hot 100 all the way up at number 38.\n\nCasey tells whatever became of &quot;Mr. Personality&quot; Lloyd Price.\n\nThis is the 48th of 52 weeks in the top 40 for one female superstar. Casey runs down the songs that did it for her.\n\nThere is a song in the countdown by a band whose lead singer who is the first and only former Playboy Bunny ever to make the top 40 (so says Casey).\n\nIn a previous show Casey said Anne Murray didn't hit number 1 until eight years after she first charted. A listener wants to know if that is a record for women and Casey says no. The record is held by a woman who first charted in 1951 but didn't hit number 1 until 1963 and then gives the details.\n\nCasey tells about an amateur band left their demo tape on the doorstep of a famous disc jockey hoping to get his advice. Instead he played their song on the BBC the next day and that song is in the top 10.\n\nLW#3: What A Fool Believes - The Doobie Brothers\nLW#2: I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor\nLW#1: Tragedy - The Bee Gees\n40:    Watch Out For Lucy - Eric Clapton\n39:    Rubber Biscuit - The Doobie Brothers\n38:    Good Night Tonight - Wings        \n37:    Every Time I Think Of You - The Babys     \nLDD: If You Love Me Let Me Know - Olivia Newton-John\n36:    Bustin' Loose - Chuck Brown &amp; The Soul Searchers     \n35:    Shake Your Body - The Jacksons    \n34:    Dog &amp; Butterfly - Heart\nARCHIVES: My Love - Paul McCartney &amp; Wings\n33:    The Chase - Georgio Moroder\n32:    Blow Away - George Harrison\n31:    Superman - Herbie Mann\n30:    I Got My Mind Made Up - Instant Funk\n29:    Love Ballad - George Benson    \n28:    In The Navy - The Village People\n27:    Precious Love - Bob Welch\n26:    Reunited - Peaches &amp; Herb\n25:    Take Me Home - Cher\n24:    I Don't Know If It's Right - Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King\n23:    Maybe I'm A Fool - Eddie Money\nARCHIVES: Give Me Love - George Harrison\n22:    He's The Greatest Dancer - Sister Sledge\n21:    Livin' It Up - Bell &amp; James\n20:    A Little More Love - Olivia Newton-John\n19:    Fire - The Pointer Sisters\n18:    Music Box Dancer - Frank Mills\n17:    Crazy Love - Poco\n16:    I Want Your Love - Chic\n15:    Heart Of Glass - Blondie\n14:    Big Shot - Billy Joel\nLDD: Thank You For Geing A Freind - Andrew Gold\n13:    I Just Fall In Love Again - Anne Murray\n12:    Stumblin' In - Suzy Quatro &amp; Chris Norman\nARCHIVES: Will It Go Round In Circles - Billy Preston\n11:    Lady - The Little River Band\n10:    Don't Cry Out Loud - Melissa Manchester\n9:    What You Won't Do For Love - Bobby Caldwell\n8:    Knock On Wood - Amii Stewart\n7:    Do You Think I'm Sexy - Rod Stewart\n6:    Sultans Of Swing - Dire Straits\n5:    Shake Your Groove Thing - Peaches &amp; Herb\n4:    Heaven Knows - Donna Summer &amp; Brooklyn Dreams\n3:    What A Fool Believes - The Doobie Brothers\n2:    I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor\n1:    Tragedy - The Bee Gees\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f0d4f93be51536e72567640e43d67af5108673","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1979_March_31st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f0d4f93be51536e72567640e43d67af5108673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,240,212,249,59,229,21,54,231,37,103,100,14,67,214,122,245,16,134,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
