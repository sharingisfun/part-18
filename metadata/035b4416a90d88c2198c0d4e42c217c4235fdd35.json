Zalosh (Wiley, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0471496774\r\n\r\nBased on the successful course which the author has been teaching for some years at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, this text shows engineers how they can build fire protection into their products, whether they are dealing with an engineering plant, machine, building or its contents. Covering general considerations which relate to the application of all fire protection engineering, the text also examines specific problem areas such as warehousing, storage of flammable liquids, and the safety of electrical equipment and computers. Features include: Presentation of the latest research in the field, such as the protection of cabling from fire Offers full international coverage, giving reference to European as well as American codes and standards A variety of up-to-date and international case studies, making this text as relevant to the practitioner as well as the academic sector Addresses problems in a manner that is practical and immediately relevant","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:035b4416a90d88c2198c0d4e42c217c4235fdd35","amp;dn":"Industrial+Fire+Protection+Engineering+-+Robert+G.+Zalosh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"035b4416a90d88c2198c0d4e42c217c4235fdd35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,91,68,22,169,13,136,194,25,140,13,78,66,194,23,196,35,95,221,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
