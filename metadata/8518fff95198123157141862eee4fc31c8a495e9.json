But I advice, this text was undoubtly written by an obsessive fan)\n\n\nCAETANO VELOSO has got the sensitiveness of the unpredictables: active composer and skilful in his interpretations, he gives life to each word, each line, each stanza he writes.\nMaking a story of each song he sings, Michael Jackson's &quot;Black Or White&quot; or Dylan's &quot;Jokerman&quot; with a poetical feeling no one has ever listened. He shifts from bossa-nova to tango tailoring his interpretations with the skill of a genius.\n\nCAETANO VELOSO, undoubtfully, is the leading representative of Brasil's popular music.\nHe's unique. Set apart the fact that Brazilian music is one of the richest and varied in the world. All this turns CIRCULADO VIVÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ into a definite masterpiece. His bet songs combined with his innovative way of interpretation are all captured in this release. A selection recorded live. The audience reacts as he touches the guitar or when a different accord is played. The beat of percussion, the sound of the cello.\n\nThose who know the music of CAETANO VELOSO will enjoy the pleasure of listening to an artist on the top. CAETANO is 50 now and, still, so unquiet. Among others, the songs &quot;Novas&quot;, &quot;Um Indo&quot;, &quot;Queixa&quot;, &quot;CirculadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ e FulÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´&quot;, &quot;VocÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âª e Linda&quot;, &quot;Sampa&quot;, &quot;O Leaozinho&quot; makes the selection besides &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;(Tom Jobim and Vinicios de Moraes)- the song that gave birth to bossa-nova - &quot;Mano a Mano&quot; (a tango, the eternal symbol of Carlos Gardel), and &quot;Oceano&quot; a song Roberto Carlos and Erasmo Carlos dedicated to CAETANO while he was exiled in London during the dictatorship in Brazil.\n\nNot enough, CAETANO VELOSO takes the opportunity to yell to the four corners the inflamed poem &quot;Americanos&quot;. A challenge to any artist's interpretation, That's CIRCULADÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ VIVO. A turn, a brilliant artist.
