The text considers the nature and basic science of the hazards faced as well as the practical management of persons exposed to chemicals and toxins (which although of biological origin behave as chemicals in terms of their effects and transmission). \n\nIndividual chapters cover the development and classification of chemical toxic agents, how exposure can occur and how medical personnel should be involved in its management . There is also consideration of the nature of toxic trauma and the pathophysiological processes involved, together with a systematic approach to early and continuing management supported by specific examples of incidents. This guide is a useful practical resource for emergency medical and paramedical personnel involved in the management of mass chemical casualties and with ensuring safe operating procedures within potentially contaminated areas to prevent secondary casualties from a chemical release.
