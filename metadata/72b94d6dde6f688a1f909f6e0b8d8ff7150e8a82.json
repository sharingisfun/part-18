The first two are complete Bibles; the third is a devotional.\n\n1. The Message Numbered Edition (Contains standard text of The Message and book introductions, plus chapter/verse numbering)\n\n2. The Message Remix (Contains standard text of The Message with chapter numbers but not verse numbers, which makes the text more readable, plus expanded introductions oriented to young people)\n\n3. The Message Solo New Testament (Daily devotional using lectio divina based on excerpts from The Message)\n\n\nabout The Message:\n\nThe Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language was created by Eugene H. Peterson and published in segments from 1993 to 2002. It is an idiomatic translation of the original languages of the Bible.\n\nThough The Message is often considered a paraphrase, it is not explicitly; The Message was translated by Peterson from the original languages. Thus, it is a highly idiomatic translation, and as such falls on the extreme dynamic end of the dynamic and formal equivalence spectrum.\n\n-----\n\nMany thanks to the original uploaders.\n\n-----\n\nA Catholic edition of The Message can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8843964&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8843964&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72b94d6dde6f688a1f909f6e0b8d8ff7150e8a82","amp;dn":"Eugene+H.+Peterson+-+The+Message+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72b94d6dde6f688a1f909f6e0b8d8ff7150e8a82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,185,77,109,222,111,104,138,31,144,159,110,11,141,143,247,21,14,138,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
