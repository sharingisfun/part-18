Released seventeen months after he had left the Specialty Records label, Richard had returned to religion and turned his back on the music that made him famous. Though he would briefly rescind that decision in 1960, and sporadically throughout his career, this album marked the end of his peak period. In order to make the record more accessible to listeners, over half of the tracks featured an overdubbed female backing group.\n\nTracklist\n1.&quot;Shake A Hand&quot;\n2.&quot;Chicken Little Baby&quot;\n3.&quot;All Night Long&quot;\n4.&quot;The Most I Can Offer (Just My Heart)&quot; \n5.&quot;Lonesome and Blue&quot;\n6.&quot;Wonderin'&quot;\n7.&quot;She Knows How To Rock&quot;\n8.&quot;Kansas City&quot;\n9.&quot;Directly From My Heart&quot; \n10.&quot;Maybe I'm Right&quot; \n11.&quot;Early One Morning&quot;\n12.&quot;I'm Just A Lonely Guy&quot; \n13.&quot;Whole Lotta Shaking Going On&quot;\n14.&quot;The Girl Can't Help It&quot;\n\nPersonnel\nLittle Richard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, piano\nLee Allen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tenor sax\nAlvin &quot;Red&quot; Tyler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ baritone sax\nFrank Fields ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nEarl Palmer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nEdgar Blanchard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470cbbcf85773b4784b4125ae084e097e61a3179","amp;dn":"Little+Richard+The+Fabulous+Little+Richard%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogerc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470cbbcf85773b4784b4125ae084e097e61a3179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,12,187,207,133,119,59,71,132,180,18,90,224,132,224,151,230,26,49,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
