Superseding earlier technologies such as COM/DCOM, .NET Remoting, ASP.NET Web Services, and the Web Services Enhancements for .NET, WCF provides a single solution that is designed to always be the best way to exchange data among software entities. It also provides the infrastructure for developing the next generation of Web Services, with support for the WS-* family of specifications, and a new serialization system for enhanced performance. In the 3.5 release, WCF has been expanded to include support for REST, JSON, and Syndication (RSS and Atom) services, further broadening the possibilities for what can be done. For information technology professionals, WCF supplies an impressive array of administration tools that enterprises and software vendors can use to reduce the cost of ownership of their solutions without writing a single line of code. Most important, WCF delivers on the promise of model-driven software development with the new software factory approach, by which one can iteratively design solutions in a modeling language and generate\n\nexecutables from lower-level class libraries.\n\n \n\nWindows Communication Foundation 3.5 Unleashed is designed to be the essential resource for software developers and architects working with WCF. The book guides readers through a conceptual understanding of all the facilities of WCF and provides step-by-step guides to applying the technology to practical problems.\n\n \n\nAs evangelists at Microsoft for WCF, WF, and CardSpace, Craig McMurtry, Marc Mercuri, Nigel Watling, and Matt Winkler are uniquely positioned to write this book. They had access to the development team and to the product as it was being built. Their work with enterprises and outside software vendors has given them unique insight into how others see the software, how they want to apply it, and the challenges they face in doing so.\n\n \n\n--Gives you nearly 100 best practices for programming with WCF\n\n--Provides detailed coverage of how to version services that you will not find anywhere else\n\n--Delves into using WCF together with Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) and Windows CardSpace\n\n--Provides detailed coverage of the new high-performance data contract serializer for .NET\n\n--Walks you through creating secure, reliable, transacted messaging, and how to understand the available options\n\n--Introduces you to federated, claims-based security and shows you how to incorporate SAML and WS-Trust security token services into your architecture\n\n--Provides step-by-step instructions for how to customize every aspect of WCF\n\n--Shows you how to add behaviors, communication channels, message encoders, and transports\n\n--Presents options for implementing publish/subscribe solutions\n\n--Gives clear guidance on peer-to-peer communications with WCF\nAbout the Author\n\nMatt Winkler is a senior Program Manager in MicrosoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Connected Systems Division, where he focuses on building the visual designer for WF.  Previously he was the Technical Evangelist for WF, focusing on driving adoption among software developers around the world.  Based in Redmond, Matt spends his non-work time reading more tech books and chasing around his two children.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 768 pages\n    * Publisher: Sams; 2 edition (October 17, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0672330245\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0672330247","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2348790a81db4ce14ba7468a1e0f4fb27c93ad","amp;dn":"Windows+Communication+Foundation+3+5+Unleashed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2348790a81db4ce14ba7468a1e0f4fb27c93ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,35,72,121,10,129,219,76,225,75,167,70,138,30,15,79,178,124,147,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
