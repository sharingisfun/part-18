Occasionally, the sleek production overwhelms the simple melodic pleasures of the songs, but the group is able to rock as hard as the Replacements when it chooses, which makes the glossy sound acceptable. Besides, the songs are what matters with Super Deluxe, and about half the record has diamond-hard melodic gems that make their aimless rocking forgivable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe9526140c49548d64588500ebdac97dcbcbb000","amp;dn":"Super+Deluxe+-+Via+Satellite+%5B1997%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe9526140c49548d64588500ebdac97dcbcbb000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,149,38,20,12,73,84,141,100,88,133,0,235,218,201,125,203,203,176,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
