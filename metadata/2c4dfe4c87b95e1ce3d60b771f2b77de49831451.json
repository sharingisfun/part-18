This book is different Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it shows how to incorporate effective teaching strategies into the unique teaching atmosphere of the emergency department, how to effectively lecture, lead small groups, give feedback, foster life-long faculty development skills, and much more Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is written by emergency medicine physicians for emergency medicine physicians.\n\nPractical Teaching in Emergency Medicine gets to the essential core of how to best teach the art of practicing emergency medicine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and provides the blueprint to become a better teacher, providing guidance on how to accomplish skilful teaching in busy emergency departments. It provides emergency physicians and trainees with the necessary tools to effectively and efficiently transmit information to learners in the often times chaotic emergency department environment.\n\n\n# Paperback: 264 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (February 17, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1405176229\n# ISBN-13: 978-1405176224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4dfe4c87b95e1ce3d60b771f2b77de49831451","amp;dn":"Practical+Teaching+in+Emergency+Medicine+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c4dfe4c87b95e1ce3d60b771f2b77de49831451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,77,254,76,135,185,94,28,227,214,11,119,31,43,119,222,73,131,20,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
