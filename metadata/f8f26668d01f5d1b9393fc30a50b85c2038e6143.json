Tesla was born to ethnic Serb parents in 1856 Croatia (at the time, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). He arrived in New York in 1884, became an American citizen in 1891, made immense contributions to science and died in Manhattan at age 86 during World War II in 1943.[1]\n\nThis biography includes references to his amazing abilities of detailed mental visualization as well as the slowly intensifying personal habits, indulgences or eccentricities for which he became nearly as well known. The film portrays Tesla in a battle with Thomas Edison over the clear superiority of Alternating Current over Direct Current. It also depicts Tesla's dream of supplying consumers all around the globe with limitless free energy.\n\nCroatian director Krsto PapiÃ„â€¡ assembled a cast which includes three American actors playing iconic personalities of 19th and early 20th century America, J. P. Morgan (1837Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1913), Thomas Edison (1847Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1931) and George Westinghouse (1846Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1914). Morgan is portrayed by Orson Welles, while Croatian actress Oja Kodar, Welles' companion for the last 24 years of his life, has the role of Katharine Johnson (1855Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1924), with whom Tesla corresponded for many years, and whose husband, Robert Underwood Johnson (1853Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1937) (portrayed by Croatian actor Boris BuzanÃ„ï¿½iÃ„â€¡) was a poet, scholar, diplomat and Tesla's longtime friend and supporter. The other Americans in the cast are character actors Strother Martin (who died six weeks before the film's September 12, 1980 English-language premiere at the Toronto Film Festival) and Dennis Patrick as Westinghouse and Edison, respectively.[2]\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Nikola_Tesla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Nikola_Tesla&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f26668d01f5d1b9393fc30a50b85c2038e6143","amp;dn":"The+Secret+of+Nikola+Tesla+-+1980+-+%2A%2A%2A+FULL+MOVIE+%2A%2A%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f26668d01f5d1b9393fc30a50b85c2038e6143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,242,102,104,208,31,93,27,147,147,252,48,165,11,133,194,3,142,97,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
