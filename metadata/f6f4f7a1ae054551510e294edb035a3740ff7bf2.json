LightZone provides a unique visual approach to digital photo editing, allowing you to focus on what you want to do with your photos, not how you do it. All operations are live and have an immediate effect upon which you can make new editing decisions. No more guess work. \n\nThe software allows you to enhance photos in a simple and natural way, without the steep learning-curve found in many other software programs. From editing RAW photographs or JPEG, TIFF or DNG photos, LightZone is a complete digital image editing application in a single software package. LightZone's intelligent editing features help adjust exposures, boost overall color, correct color shifts and white balance errors, selectively sharpen or blur images or parts of images, remove dust spots and reduce the noise often found in high-ISO digital images.\n\nNew in LightZone 3.9:\n\n- Added Canon 1D Mk IV RAW support\n- Added Canon 7D RAW support\n- Added Canon 500D/T1i RAW support\n- Added Canon 550D/T2i RAW support\n- Added Canon G11 RAW support\n- Added Canon S90 RAW support\n- Added Nikon D3s RAW support\n- Added Nikon D300s RAW support\n- Added Nikon D3000 RAW support\n- Added Nikon P6000 RAW support\n- Added Olympus E-P2 RAW support\n- Added Olympus E-PL1 RAW support\n- Added Panasonic Lumix GF1 RAW support\n- Added Leica D-LUX 4 RAW support\n- Added Leica M9 RAW support\n- Added Pentax K-7 RAW support\n- Added Pentax K-x RAW support\n- Added Sony A550 RAW support\n- Added Sony A850 RAW support\n- Added Samsung GX-20 RAW support\n\nNote: The keygen is for LightZone 3.7 but works perfectly for this, which is 3.9\n\n1.
