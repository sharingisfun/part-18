Aaron's take-aways will have you progressively-enhancing your markup, style and behavior with ease.&quot; --Dan Cederholm, Author, CSS3 For Web Designers\n\n&quot;With this forward-thinking book Aaron shows us that anyone can produce accessible, engaging web experiences without sacrificing their ambitions. Through progressive enhancement, he'll show you how to bring designs to life without compromising the integrity of content. I've been learning from Aaron for many years, and suggest you do the same.&quot; --Simon Collison, Co-author, CSS Mastery\n\n&quot;You hear the term 'Progressive Enhancement' bandied about as a good thing, and it absolutely is.
