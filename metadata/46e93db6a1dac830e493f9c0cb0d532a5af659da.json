Jacques Philippe - Time for God (EPUB, MOBI, PDF)\r\n\r\nAre you too busy to pray? What if you could actually gain time and be more productive by praying? Would you pray more? We often forget the real secret to gaining time and being productive is to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness , and all these things shall be yours as well (Mt 6:33). If we make time for God through prayer, He multiplies our time and makes it fruitful and productive in all areas of our life. But have you ever felt unsure about how to pray? For that matter, what exactly is prayer and who is it for? And where, when and how should you pray?\r\n\r\nThese questions find an answer in this latest book from Scepter, Time for God. Written in a simple and modern style, author Jacques Philippe draws on years of experience as a spiritual guide to illuminate the fundamental principles of true prayer and describes some common mistakes and misconceptions that can lead it astray. This book is a must-read for anyone wanting to make better use of their time with God.\r\n\r\nTime for God has become an international bestseller in French and Spanish and is written by the bestselling author of Interior Freedom, also published by Scepter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e93db6a1dac830e493f9c0cb0d532a5af659da","amp;dn":"Fr.+Jacques+Philippe+-+Time+for+God+%28EPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e93db6a1dac830e493f9c0cb0d532a5af659da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,233,61,182,161,218,200,48,228,147,249,192,203,13,83,42,90,246,89,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
