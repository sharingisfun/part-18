This track was also included on their first album, which is well worth a spin and on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHas It Dawned On You?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ compilation. It is sung accepela (without instruments). Much of their material was melodic with harmony vocals and acoustic guitar. There are similarities to David Crosby and Steve Stills here, but their music was influenced by US country-rock too. \n\n\n\n1. Carry Me   \n2. Paris Morning   \n3. Signs of the Times   \n4.
