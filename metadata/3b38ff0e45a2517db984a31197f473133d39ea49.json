Really funky, rhythmic, sentimental beats. Reggae, funk, arab, hindi, beguine, ska, power pop, chillout etc sung &amp; played their own way.\nAnd it sounds spectacular!\n\nHere is a first compilation. The sound quality &amp; spelling are as downloaded. I spent enough time going through the hundreds of songs. Some of them I also found on www.bclub19.com.\nYes &amp; ooops, I've noticed I mixed up some tracks on these compilations, but hey, I'm dealing with hours of musica.  =)\n\nSince I don't understand somali, I can't tell if the songs are about love, politics, religion, homesickness or else. But in both the voices &amp; harmonies, I can feel a lot of love...\n\n\n                               *  *  *\n\n&quot;Somali musicians are at the forefront of those who have fallen victims of the civil war and anarchy. The clan-based factional fighting that broke out in many parts of the country rendered almost all Somali artists hopeless. In addition to losses of beloved family members, the livelihoods of the musicians got completely shattered as the warring militias either looted or destroyed their musical equipments.\n\nBecause of this shocking incident and the unabated fighting, a large number of Somali musicians fled to the neighboring countries where they are still today suffering in isolation with no international intervention for their plight, while a small number of them made their way to Europe and North America.\n\nSomali artists who remain in the country ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ because they are either unable to flee or have chosen not to do so ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are continually faced with targeted killings, intimidation, injuries, and deprivation of their basic rights to work and express themselves freely BY ALL SIDES in the conflict but these violations are not reported to the outside world.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.freemuse.org/sw29844.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.freemuse.org/sw29844.asp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n                            ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMusic is good.\n          It is not good that some people try to stop the music.\n        Most Somalis like enjoying themselves, dancing and singingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n                             Maryam Mursal\n\n                               *  *  *\n\n\nThanx &amp; Mahadsanid for seeding.\n\n\n144 tunes, almost 14 hours of Somali music, so... ENJOY!  :)\n\n\n/Fiestalito\n\n\n\n\nps:\n1.  I'm looking for tunes performed by Sahro Dawo &amp; Baastow, Durdur and other \n    funky East-Africans in the 80's. The tapes/cassettes I bought in Djibouti\n    more than 20 years ago aren't good enough to digitalize. Anyone?\n  \n2.  I've found all tunes (but one on nr 2) onda Mighty Free Internet!\n    No CD ripping, only promoting and supporting the somalian music scene.\n\n\n**********\n\n\n03-28  Compilation nr 2!\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4806176/Somali_Music_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4806176/Somali_Music_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n04-19  Compilation nr 3!\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4858871/Somali_music_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4858871/Somali_music_3&lt;/a&gt;\n\n04-28  Compilation nr 4!\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4872440/Somali_music_4_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4872440/Somali_music_4_&lt;/a&gt;\n\n07-02  Compilation nr 5!\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4984716/Somali_music_5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4984716/Somali_music_5&lt;/a&gt;\n\n08-28  Compilation nr 6!\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5071231/Somali_music_6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5071231/Somali_music_6&lt;/a&gt;\n\n12-24  Compilation nr 7!\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5239704/Somali_music_7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5239704/Somali_music_7&lt;/a&gt;\n\n01-29  Compilation nr 8!\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5316489/Somali_music_8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5316489/Somali_music_8&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b38ff0e45a2517db984a31197f473133d39ea49","amp;dn":"Somali+Music+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b38ff0e45a2517db984a31197f473133d39ea49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,56,255,14,69,162,81,125,185,132,163,17,151,244,115,19,61,57,234,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
