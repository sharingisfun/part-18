It enables you to capture stills and video streams from any WDM supporting TV tuner card.\nSome noteable features:\n- Full captured frame size - 768x576 for PAL, 720x480 for NTSC.\n- The 2GB file size limit for AVI files has been resolved.\n- It works on all Windows platforms, from 9x to XP.\n\nMost modern PC TV tuners are based on the BrookTree 878 (A), also known as Conexant Fusion 878A. This chip is an 8 bit videodecoder, and inherits from the predecessor Bt848. All have a bad decoding quality for standard SECAM.\nFly2000TV was developed to support TV tuners based on the Philips saa713x series videodecoder chip. This chip has appeared rather recently. In contrast with Bt8x8 it has a 9 bit videodecoder. The visual quality of the decoded image of a saa713x is higher than that of Bt8x8, particularly on SECAM standard.\n\nThe majority of the Philips saa713x tuners feature a remote control: the RM-050. Fly 2000 TV supports this RC and uses the extended set of functions of this board.\nAlso, the program Fly 2000 TV supports other models of TV tuners, not only ones that are based on the Philips chip. The only requirement is the presence of a WDM (Windows Driver Model) driver for your tuner. With VxD drivers the program will not work.\n\nHere is a list of TV tuners based on the Philips saa713x, built on the Proteus Pro reference design: \n\nAldi Tevion MD9717 \nSKnet Monster TV \nTerratec Sinergy 400/600 \nK-World KW-TV713XRF\nTyphoon TV\nManli Much TV \n\nThese tuners are controlled via I2C bus on address 0xC0, they usually have HF module B/G format. To make Fly 2000 TV work with these tuners, the option &quot;Control of HF tuner module through WDM driver&quot; has to be turned ON.\n\n\nFLY 2000 TV - program for a TV tuners, based on chips Philips saa7130, saa7134.
