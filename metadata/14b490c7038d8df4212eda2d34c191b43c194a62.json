Opportunity abounds in a city emerging from the swamps, its growth fueled by the violent power struggle in a lucrative drug trade. Construction is everywhere as a shining metropolis rises from foundations of crime and betrayal.\n\nAs a soldier, Vic Vance has always protected his dysfunctional family, his country, and himself. One bad decision later and that job is about to get much harder. Kicked out onto the streets of a city torn between glamor and gluttony, Vic is faced with a stark choice: build an empire or be crushed.\n\nThis PS2 port of the PSP hit brings gamers back to the city of the second entry in the GTA III trilogy, with new characters meet and new locations to explore in this second trip to Vice City on PS2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b490c7038d8df4212eda2d34c191b43c194a62","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto%3A+Vice+City+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b490c7038d8df4212eda2d34c191b43c194a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,180,144,199,3,141,141,244,33,46,218,45,52,193,145,180,60,25,74,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
