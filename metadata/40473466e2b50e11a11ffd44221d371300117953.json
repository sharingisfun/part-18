THIS IS A GAME RIP AND DOES NOT CONTAIN AN ISO\n\nFamily Guy: Back to the Multiverse is an action-adventure game that was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on November 20, 2012, in North America, November 21, 2012, in Australia and November 23, 2012, in Europe. The game is based on the animated television series Family Guy, most notably the episode &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot;, and is also a continuation of the &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode. This game also features the return of Stewie's evil half-brother Bertram, who was killed in the show. Back to the Multiverse is the first Family Guy console game since Family Guy Video Game! in 2006. When the game was available for pre-order, people who pre-ordered the game received a special level, based on Aliens: Colonial Marines, another video game based on the Aliens trademark also owned by 20th Century Fox, which was released the next February to similar negative reception.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40473466e2b50e11a11ffd44221d371300117953","amp;dn":"Family+Guy%3A+Back+to+the+Multiverse+%28J-TAG%2FRGH+ONLY%29+XBOX360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40473466e2b50e11a11ffd44221d371300117953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,71,52,102,226,181,14,17,161,31,253,68,34,29,55,19,0,17,121,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
