Twenty-five years ago it was hard to have a bad meal in France; now, in some cities and towns, it is a challenge to find a good one. For the first time in the annals of modern cooking, the most influential chefs and the most talked-about restaurants in the world are not French. Within France, large segments of the wine industry are in crisis, cherished artisanal cheeses are threatened with extinction, and bistros and brasseries are disappearing at an alarming rate. But business is brisk at some establishments: Astonishingly, France has become the second-most-profitable market in the world for McDonaldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.\nHow did this happen? To find out, Michael Steinberger takes an enviable trip through the traditional pleasures of France. He talks to top chefsÃ¢â‚¬â€Alain Ducasse, Paul Gagnaire, Paul BocuseÃ¢â‚¬â€winemakers, farmers, bakers, and other artisans. He visits the Ãƒâ€°lysÃƒÂ©e Palace, interviews the head of McDonaldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Europe, marches down a Paris boulevard with JosÃƒÂ© BovÃƒÂ©, and breaks bread with the editorial director of the powerful and secretive Michelin Guide. He spends hours with some of FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brightest young chefs and winemakers, who are battling to reinvigorate the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rich culinary heritage. The result is a sharp and funny book that will give Francophiles everywhere an entirely new perspectiveÃ¢â‚¬â€political, economic, personal, and culturalÃ¢â‚¬â€on the crisis in the country and food they love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1e44b6634bac0baa6b2f419ca1596f19ca14177","amp;dn":"Au+Revoir+to+All+That+-Steinberger-+%5BGastronomy%5D+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1e44b6634bac0baa6b2f419ca1596f19ca14177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,228,75,102,52,186,192,186,166,178,244,25,202,21,150,241,156,161,65,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
