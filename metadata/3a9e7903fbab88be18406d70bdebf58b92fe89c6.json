Since that time, Johnny's crafted his own and reinterpreted others' blues standards and rock classics including B.B. King's &quot;Rock Me Baby,&quot; Chuck Berry's &quot;Johnny B. Goode,&quot; and Bob Dylan's &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; -and they're all here, as only Johnny Winter can play'em. With ferocious licks and a look like no other, Johnny Winter has stamped a unique impression on both the blues and rock 'n' roll while becoming one of contemporary music's most prolific and enduring stars. Original Recordings Produced by Johnny Winter.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9e7903fbab88be18406d70bdebf58b92fe89c6","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter+-+Mojo+Workin%27+Blues+%281997%29%5BEAC-FLAC%40320kbs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9e7903fbab88be18406d70bdebf58b92fe89c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,158,121,3,251,171,136,190,24,64,109,112,189,235,245,139,146,254,137,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
