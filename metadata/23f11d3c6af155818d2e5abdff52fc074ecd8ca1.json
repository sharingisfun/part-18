This outcome, once unlikely, is now alarmingly common. Twenty-five years after Prozac entered the marketplace, 10 percent of Americans over the age of six use an SSRI antidepressant.\n\nIn Coming of Age on Zoloft, Sharpe blends deeply personal writing, thoughtful interviews, and historical context to achieve an unprecedented portrait of the antidepressant generation. She explores questions of identity that arise for people who start medication before they have an adult sense of self. She asks why some individuals find a diagnosis of depression reassuring, while others are threatened by it. She presents, in young people's own words, their intimate and complicated relationships with their medication. And she weighs the cultural implications of America's biomedical approach to moods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f11d3c6af155818d2e5abdff52fc074ecd8ca1","amp;dn":"Coming+of+Age+on+Zoloft+-+Katherine+Sharpe.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f11d3c6af155818d2e5abdff52fc074ecd8ca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,241,29,60,106,241,85,129,141,46,90,189,255,82,252,7,78,205,140,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
