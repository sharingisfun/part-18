The dad harbors a secret, and he goes to murderous lengths to keep it hidden. The young man, Jimmy, who sleeps out in the shed, has suspicions, but little comes out until a Yankee woman of middle age comes to town looking for a dead private eye. And why does dad keep calling Jimmy, &quot;little boy blue&quot;?&quot; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119547/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119547/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc6ee67d519a525b93a68d6be9bd5df0ed4daa59","amp;dn":"Little+Boy+Blue.Divx.1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc6ee67d519a525b93a68d6be9bd5df0ed4daa59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,110,230,125,81,154,82,91,147,166,141,107,233,189,93,240,237,77,170,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
