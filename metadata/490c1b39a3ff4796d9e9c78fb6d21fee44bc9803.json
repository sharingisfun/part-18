With the continued increase in available natural gas ready to export - especially LNG - and the definition of &quot;deepwater&quot; changing every year, an understanding of thermal insulation is more critical than ever. This one-of-a-kind handbook helps oil and gas engineers ensure that their products are exporting safely and that the equipment's integrity is protected. Topics include: * Design considerations and component selection, including newer materials such as cellular glass* Methods to properly install the insulation material and notable inspection and safety considerations in accordance with applicable US and international standards, specifically designed for the oil and gas industry* Calculations to make sure that every scenario is considered and requirements for size, composition, and packaging are met effectively * Understand all appropriate, new and existing, insulation material properties as well as installation requirements* Gain practical knowledge on factors affecting insulation efficiency, rules of thumb, and links to real-world case studies* Maximize flow assurance safely and economically with critical calculations provided","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:490c1b39a3ff4796d9e9c78fb6d21fee44bc9803","amp;dn":"Thermal+Insulation+Handbook+for+the+Oil%2C+Gas%2C+and+Petrochemical+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"490c1b39a3ff4796d9e9c78fb6d21fee44bc9803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,12,27,57,163,255,71,150,217,233,199,143,182,210,31,238,68,188,152,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
