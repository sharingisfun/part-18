David HorowitzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic Why Israel is the Victim, updated by the author, sets the record straight about the basic truths of the Middle East conflict. In addition to restoring the authentic history of the region Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a history of obsessive aggression first by Arab countries determined to physically annihilate the Jewish State and later by terror groups determined to destroy its will to survive and right to existÃ¢â‚¬â€this booklet brings the story up to date by showing the systematic way in which Hamas and Hezbollah, under IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s direction, have subverted peace in the Middle East. As Shillman Fellow Daniel Greenfield notes in his insightful introduction, this pamphlet Ã¢â‚¬Å“tells us why we should reject the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blame Israel FirstÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ narrative that has so thoroughly saturated the mainstream mediaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ It confronts the myth of Palestinian victimhoodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and it delivers a rousing restatement of the true history of the hate that led us to all this.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ America should be IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protector. Instead, as David Horowitz notes, under the leadership of Barack Obama, it has become its prosecutor.\n\nAbout the author:\n David Horowitz is an ex-Marxist and now conservative author and lecturer on college campuses. He was employed during the 1960s as a political aide to Bertrand Russell, a editor of Ramparts and one of the founders of the non-profit organization: David Horowitz Freedom Center.
