In addition, CS: GO will introduce new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Doug Lombardi at Valve. Ã¢â‚¬Å“For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCS: GO is being developed by Valve in cooperation with Seattle-based Hidden Path Entertainment. The title is targeted for release in early 2012 and will be playable at this yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PAX Prime and Eurogamer Expo.\n\nAviaRa Team brings you COUNTER-STRIKE GLOBAL OFFENSIVE\n\nThe game is fully cracked, just install it and play on cracked servers\nWe work on our cracked server so in 1 or 2 days it will be up just for you\nUntill then you can play this in offline mod with bots or you could play with friends if you follow some simple steps:\n\n\n1.Open game\n2.Open console (press ~ button)\n3.Create a game with bots\n4.Join a friend game with bots by typing &quot;connect your friends`s ip&quot; like an example &quot;connect 187.0.1.2&quot;\n5.If you don`t know the ip just go to: http://whatismyipaddress.com/ and see what ip you/he have/has.\n\nIf you like this game please seed it to others\n\nWe are looking for nice coders\nWe are looking for seeders\nWe are looking for people who could help us\nWe are looking for Games Helpers\nwe are looking for people with seedbox\n\n\nIf you think you are one of those contact us at\n\nHow To Get Your Maxspeed (uTorrent)\n\nTorrent Client - Preferences - Bandwidth - Number of connections - Set aprox. 500 for each\nTorrent Client - Preferences - BiTorrent - Protocol Encryption - Forced\nBandwidth Allocation - High (Set download/upload limit - Unlimited)\nStop Other Active Torrents - Start downloading and wait for connections.\nEnjoy and Seed for at least 1:1 ratio.
