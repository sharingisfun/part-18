Clay Wilson, is an American underground cartoonist and central figure in the underground comix movement. Wilson attracted attention from readers with aggressively violent and sexually explicit panoramas of lowlife denizens, often depicting the wild escapades of pirates and bikers. He was an early contributor to Zap Comix, and Wilson's artistic audacity has been cited by R. Crumb as a liberating source of inspiration for Crumb's own work.\n\nBorn in Lincoln, Nebraska, Wilson drew from age 12 and attended the University of Nebraska. Trained as a medic in the United States Army, he held odd jobs before moving to San Francisco in 1968. Wilson lived in Lawrence, Kansas, before moving West.\n\nOf when he first saw Wilson's work (in about 1968) Robert Crumb said, &quot;the content was something like I'd never seen before, anywhere, the level of mayhem, violence, dismemberment, naked women, loose body parts, huge, obscene sex organs, a nightmare vision of hell-on-earth never so graphically illustrated before in the history of art.&quot; And &quot;suddenly my own work seemed insipid....&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30aa69242ea7bd5aed7f88e5b529d6308e75c32c","amp;dn":"S+Clay+Wilson+-+Pork+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30aa69242ea7bd5aed7f88e5b529d6308e75c32c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,170,105,36,46,167,189,90,237,127,136,229,181,41,214,48,142,117,195,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
