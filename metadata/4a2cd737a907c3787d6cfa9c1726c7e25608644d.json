But is Timmy really Tammy? Or is Tommy? Only their dimwitted cousin Marilyn Warluski knows for sureÃ¢â‚¬â€and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a moment to spare. Savich has tracked the Tuttles to an abandoned barn in rural Maryland, rescuing their latest victims in the nick of time. Hey! Timmy just turned into Tammy! No, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tommy! But what are those miniature spinning cyclone-ghouls that Tammy/Timmy/Tommy seem to will into being? Blam! Savich shoots one and the rest disappear. Meanwhile, out in Hemlock Bay in northern California, SavichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s younger sister, Lily Frasier, is recovering from a car crash that nearly took her life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a2cd737a907c3787d6cfa9c1726c7e25608644d","amp;dn":"Catherine+Coulter+-Hemlock+Bay+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a2cd737a907c3787d6cfa9c1726c7e25608644d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,44,215,55,169,7,195,120,125,108,250,156,23,38,199,226,86,8,100,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
