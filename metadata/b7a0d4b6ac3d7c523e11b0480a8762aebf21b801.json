Indeed if space was an environment the Nordic pair sought to capture, they've succeeded with ample supplies of starkness and sparseness.\n\nEnriched by its ability to wander untethered by gravity or expectation, 'Smilewound' is ultimately an uplifting record, even if the lyrical content can, at times, be somewhat grave. From opening track, and lead single, 'Toothwheels' to closer 'Time To Scream And Shout', the album envelops the listener; placing them in a paradoxical realm where all is free flowing and empty yet safe and welcoming.\n\nTo help the band soar into the upper atmosphere, mÃƒÂºm enlisted the help of American solo artist Beirut, for deep cut 'Candlestick', and pop queen Kylie Minogue, who features on the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bonus track 'Whistle' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which was originally recorded for 2012 film 'Jack &amp; Diane'.\n\nTaken from Clashmusic/Soundcloud","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a0d4b6ac3d7c523e11b0480a8762aebf21b801","amp;dn":"m%26uacute%3Bm+Smilewound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a0d4b6ac3d7c523e11b0480a8762aebf21b801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,160,212,182,172,61,124,82,62,17,176,72,10,135,98,174,191,33,184,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
