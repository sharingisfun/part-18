The Complete Guide to Traditional Taxidermy will show you the pleasure of performing taxidermy work for yourself and the profit to be gained in performing the art for others. The authors' thirty-five years of experience support every explanation and detailed instruction as they break down what it takes to be a collector, properly use the tools of the trade, and clean, skin, and mount a wide variety of game. Inside are all the original instructions for handling game from start to finish, including sections on mounting heads, fish, and reptiles, tanning skins, collecting and exhibiting insects and eggs, using tools and gathering materials, selecting eyes and wires, and much more.\n\n\nBy Charles K.
