The result is an album which at least could be described as &quot;different&quot;, but certainly terms as atmospheric and eloquent are appropriate as well. A must have for every wannabe guitarplayer, just for the track &quot;Tranquillizer&quot; in which Jan plays a mesmerizing chord progression with just a Roland Drummachine. \n\nBrought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project) \n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :) \n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008. Encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s\nGet Your Free Copy of the EAC and FLAC suite at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP project! \nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork.
