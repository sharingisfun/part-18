Valens' version of &quot;La Bamba&quot; is ranked number 345 on Rolling Stone magazines list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and is the only song on the list not sung in English.\n\nLa Bamba has been covered by numerous artists, most notably Los Lobos, whose version reached #1 in the U.S. and UK singles charts in 1987.\n\nLa Bamba is a classic example of the Son Jarocho musical style which originated in the Mexican state of Veracruz and combines Spanish, African, and Indigenous musical elements. The song is typically played on one or two arpas jarochas (harps) along with guitar relatives the jarana jarocha and the requinto jarocho. Lyrics to the song greatly vary, as performers often improvise verses while performing. However, versions such as those by musical groups Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan and Los Pregoneros del Puerto have survived because of the artists' popularity. The traditional aspect of &quot;La Bamba&quot; lies in the tune itself, which remains the almost the same through most versions.[dubious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ discuss] The name of the dance, which has no direct English translation, is presumably connected with the Spanish verb bambolear, meaning &quot;to shake&quot; or perhaps &quot;to stomp&quot;.\n\nThe traditional &quot;La Bamba&quot; is often played during weddings in Veracruz, where the bride and groom perform the accompanying dance. Today this wedding tradition is not done as frequently as in the past, but the dance is still popular, perhaps through the popularity of ballet folklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³rico. The dance is performed displaying the newly-wed coupleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unity through the performance of complicated, delicate steps in unison as well as through creation of a bow from a listÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, a long red ribbon, using only their feet.\n\nThe &quot;arriba&quot; (literally &quot;up&quot;) part of the song suggests the nature of the dance, in which the footwork, called &quot;zapateado&quot;, is done faster and faster as the music tempo accelerates. The repeated lyric, &quot;Yo no soy marinero, soy capitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n&quot; (lit: &quot;I am not a sailor, I am a captain&quot;), refers to Veracruz's marine locale and perhaps the husband's promise that he will remain faithful to his wife.\n\nLos Lobos (&quot;The Wolves&quot;) are an American Chicano rock band. They are three-time Grammy Award winners. Their music is influenced by rock and roll, Tex-Mex, country music, folk, R&amp;B, blues, and traditional Spanish and Mexican music such as boleros and norteÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±os. Mexican-American roots-rock group Los Lobos has been performing and releasing albums since the late 1970s.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1de9d81427155b8e68c0b7ba606d46fabd2e540c","amp;dn":"Los+Lobos+-+La+Bamba+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1de9d81427155b8e68c0b7ba606d46fabd2e540c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,233,216,20,39,21,91,142,104,192,183,186,96,109,70,250,189,46,84,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
