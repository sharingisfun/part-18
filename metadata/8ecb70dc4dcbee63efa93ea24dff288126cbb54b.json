The collection presents original field recordings by Yves Moreau recorded in all ethnographic regions of Bulgaria between 1966 and 1972.\n\nNumerous recordings of Bulgarian folk music have been released in recent years but the vast majority have focused mainly on the trendy professional Bulgarian women's choirs, cleverly marketed internationally as &quot;mysterious&quot; or &quot;magic&quot;. This new collection presents field recordings from all over Bulgaria and the selections offer a precious glimpse into lesser-known instrumental and vocal styles, ancient instruments as well as more modern orchestras, ritual songs, dances in complex rhythms etc.\n\nThe late sixties and early seventies were fertile years in the development of folk heritage in Bulgaria. Traditions were still very much alive in towns and villages and the Communist government of that time strongly supported and encouraged the development of creative and performing arts which gave birth to today's still flourishing women's choirs and folk-jazz type formations known as svadbari or wedding bands whose exponents include Ivo Papazov and Yuri Yunakov.\n\nMoreau's recordings are fascinating for they show us the &quot;raw&quot; material which forms the basis of today's Bulgarian folk music scene. Many of the men and women heard on these albums are no longer alive and their form of artistry has often been forgotten altogether. This collection is not meant to be an in-depth ethno-musicological anthology. Its main purpose is to offer a musical &quot;buffet&quot; to the average listener and fan of world and traditional music, illustrating the beauty, richness, talent and diversity of the Bulgarian people. Originally, the material had been intended to appear in the form of 2 vinyl LP's for Folkways Records in New York in the early seventies. Moreau's frequent ravels combined with the sudden death of Folkways director Moe Asch, put the project on hold.\n\nListeners will be amazed at the sound quality even after thirty years of storage for those old reel-to-reel tapes. Background noises, such as conversations, passing cars and motorcycles, birds and appreciative crowds have been left untouched.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ecb70dc4dcbee63efa93ea24dff288126cbb54b","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+mystery+-+village+music+of+bulgaria%2C+vol1%2C2%263","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ecb70dc4dcbee63efa93ea24dff288126cbb54b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,203,112,220,77,203,238,99,239,169,62,162,77,255,40,129,38,203,181,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
