It contains the band's most popular songs and music videos. The collection has outsold their previous hits compilation, Time Flies... The Best of Huey Lewis &amp; the News from the previous decade. In January 2012, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA.\n\nA version without the DVD was released as Greatest Hits with different cover artwork.\n\nHuey Lewis and the News is an American pop rock band based in San Francisco, California. They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually scoring a total of 19 top-ten singles across the Billboard Hot 100, Adult Contemporary and Mainstream Rock charts.\n\nTheir greatest success was in the 1980s with the number-one album, Sports, coupled with a series of highly successful MTV videos. Their worldwide fame expanded when the song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was featured as a key track in the film Back to the Future (in which Lewis had a cameo appearance), became a number-one hit, and was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThe News combined a rock (and sometimes, a &quot;blues-rock&quot;) backing with soul and doo-wop-influenced harmony vocals and Lewis' voice.\n\nIn 1972, singer/harmonica player Huey Lewis and keyboardist Sean Hopper joined the Bay Area jazz-funk band Clover. Clover recorded several albums in the 1970s, and in the middle of the decade transplanted themselves to England to become part of the UK pub rock scene for a time. Without Lewis (but with Hopper), they eventually became the original backing band for Elvis Costello's first album My Aim Is True. Lewis also worked with Irish band Thin Lizzy, contributing harmonica to the song &quot;Baby Drives Me Crazy,&quot; recorded onstage for the Live and Dangerous album. Lizzy bassist/vocalist Phil Lynott introduces Lewis by name during the song. The band returned to the Bay Area by the end of the 1970s.\n\nLater in 1980, the band issued their first studio album, a self-titled LP, Huey Lewis and the News. It went largely unnoticed. In 1982, the band released their second studio album, the self-produced Picture This. The album turned gold, fueled by the breakout success of the hit single &quot;Do You Believe in Love&quot;, written by former Clover producer Mutt Lange. Largely because of the single, the album remained on the Billboard 200 album chart for 35 weeks and peaked at No. 13. The follow-up singles from Picture This, &quot;Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do&quot; and &quot;Workin' for a Livin'&quot;, followed with limited success.\n\nThe band returned to the studio in 2010, recording their first album of new material in nearly a decade. The album, entitled Soulsville, is a Stax Records tribute album recorded at the legendary Ardent Studios. As of February 2013, the band is in the studio to record an album of all new material; in the meantime, the group is planning a tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of Sports. A 30th Anniversary Edition of Sports was released in May 2013 which included a second disc that featured live tracks. The band has sold over an estimated 30 million records worldwide according to an interview with Johnny Colla in 2006.\n(videos do not have any logos &amp; are extracted untouched)\n\n\n\nHuey Lewis and The News - Greatest Hits &amp; Videos [Promo Music Video VOB's] folder contains:\n\n1.
