From the late '40s to the mid-'60s, he was a massively successful pop singer who ranked with such contemporaries as Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, and Dean Martin. He shared with those peers a career that encompassed hit records, international touring, radio and television shows, and appearances in films. But unlike them, he had not emerged from a background as a band singer in the swing era. Instead, he had spent a decade as a celebrated jazz pianist, leading his own small group. Oddly, that was one source of controversy. For some reason, there seem to be more jazz critics than fans of traditional pop among music journalists, and Cole's transition from jazz to pop during a period when jazz itself was becoming less popular was seen by them as a betrayal. At the same time, as a prominent African-American entertainer during an era of tumultuous change in social relations among the races in the U.S., he sometimes found himself out of favor with different warring sides. His efforts at integration, which included suing hotels that refused to admit him and moving into a previously all-white neighborhood in Los Angeles, earned the enmity of racists; once, he was even physically attacked on-stage in Alabama. But civil rights activists sometimes criticized him for not doing enough for the cause.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tExact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 1\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nCue File:\t\tYes\nM3U File:\t\tYes\nLog file:\t\tIncluded In Torrent Description\n\t\t\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tVocal\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel: \t\t\tEMI/Capitol\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Unforgettable\n02.Answer Me, My Love\n03.Ramblin' Rose\n04.A Blossom Fell\n05.Ballerina\n06.Mona Lisa\n07.Walkin' My Baby Back Home\n08.(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons\n09.Send For Me\n10.The Sand And The Sea\n\n\nNote: I didn't include the log file in the torrent for technical reasons.
