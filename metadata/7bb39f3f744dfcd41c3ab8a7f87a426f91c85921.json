In 1974, Wood took a step out from out of the shadows and issued his first solo release, I'VE GOT MY OWN ALBUM TO DO. His debut has a definite 'home made' feel to it, with such all-star friends as the Face's keyboardist/pianist Ian McLagan and the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards join Wood in the festivities. Standouts include a pair of Richards tracks (&quot;Act Together&quot; and &quot;Sure the One You Need&quot;), a cover of &quot;If You Gotta Make A Fool of Somebody,&quot; and the crude n' bluesy album closer, &quot;Crotch Music.&quot;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
