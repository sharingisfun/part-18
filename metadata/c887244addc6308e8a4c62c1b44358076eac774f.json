Oz Blackstone, now an international film star, is sitting on the verandah of his opulent villaÃ¢â‚¬â€one of three homesÃ¢â‚¬â€idly gazing at Roman AbramovitchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s luxury yacht as it slips into the harbor. Life doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get much better than this. But somebody knows where Oz lives. A struggling author sweet-talks him into buying the movie rights to his latest novel for $50,000, and a shocking trap is laid. The demons from OzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past are gaining on himÃ¢â‚¬â€blackmail and murder are lurking in the shadows. Oz travels all the way to Singapore to track down the owner of some incriminating photographs, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in grave danger of over-exposure. And when organized crime muscles into the picture, Oz finds himself perilously close to losing a lot more than his wealth and reputation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c887244addc6308e8a4c62c1b44358076eac774f","amp;dn":"For+the+Death+of+Me+-+%5BOz+Blackstone%2C+%239%5D+-+Quintin+Jardine.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c887244addc6308e8a4c62c1b44358076eac774f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,135,36,74,221,198,48,142,138,76,98,193,180,67,88,7,110,172,119,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
