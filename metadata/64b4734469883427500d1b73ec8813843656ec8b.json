ScopeÃƒÂ­s open-ended          \ngraphical patching system and diverse set of modules give you access to a new          \ncustomizable processing environment capable of a very broad range of effects.          \n\nScope`s tactile workflow and vast sonic potential will inspire you to push the         \nenvelope while its flexible architecture invites you to try imaginative new            \nrouting scenarios to explore endless possibilities.                                    \n\nUse it to generate vivid electronic tones and textures or to process your drum         \nloops soft synths sound effects and external hardware.                                 \n\nAt the heart of Scope you will find a selection of modules you can freely configure    \nby populating up to 8 slots. Once populated with a module a slot will give you access  \nto up to 4 input and output nodes which you can freely connect via Scope`s virtual     \npatch cables. Inputs and Outputs are configured to have the ability to send and        \nreceive multiple signals at once making very complex modulation scenarios possible.    \n\nScope ships with 26 modules ranging from effects to utility with additional modules    \nalready planned for future updates.                                                    \n\nScopeÃƒÂ­s unique workflow and interface will change the way you think about modulation   \nand signal processing.                                                                 \n\nThe plugin makes it possible to set up completely self generating patches making it    \nequally capable as a sound generator and effects processor.                            \n\nOur designers have included a variety of external and internally generated effects     \npatches to show what the plugin is capable of.                                         \n\nTo get you started we`ve included 160 patches by Subjex Balkansky Thomas Hennebert     \nApparition Daed John Black Shiro Fujioka and Blush Response.                           \n\nEmbracing all things modular Scope includes a Eurorack modular synthesizer sample      \nlibrary comprised of over 1500 samples.                                                \n\nWe worked with 6 of the best module manufacturers to put together the Eurorack system  \nused to generate all the content. Our goal was to create a functional counterpart to   \nScope something you canÃƒÂ­t easily achieve with a computer that interacts well with the  \nplugin and gives you a new palette of sounds to work with right out of the box.        \n\nFocused on the darker side of modular synthesis sound designer Ivo Ivanov created a    \ncollection of compelling effects that are equally distinctive and indicative of the    \ndepth of Eurorack`s prodigious sonic landscape.                                        \n\nCrafted with a combination of analogue and digital modules ScopeÃƒÂ­s library is packed   \nwith gritty and intricate synthesizer sounds in the form of hits stabs glitches one    \nshots and asymmetrical passages you can use to create your own rhythms basslines       \npercussive elements and much more.                                                     \n\nTo give you a true sense of the modular sound the library features raw samples with    \nno further processing. Import the sound effects into your favorite DAW or sampler and  \nprocess stretch bend and twist them into something truly unique.                       \n\nTo show you how the samples can be integrated into your projects weÃƒÂ­ve included loops  \nby sound designers Ivo Ivanov Thomas Hennebert Apparition and Daed.                    \n\nINTELLIJEL:                                                                            \n\nA Canadian based rag tag team of engineers university professors music makers and synth\ngeeks.
