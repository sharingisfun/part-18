The grisly nature of his death made instant headlines: with twenty-nine knife wounds, his throat slit, and a gunshot to the head, Travis was left to die. The prime suspect in the case was AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-girlfriend, the attractive and soft-spoken Jodi Arias. Though Arias initially said that she was nowhere near the scene of the crime, little about this case was as it seemed, and before long she had been caught lying to police. As the investigation progressed, her lies evolved multiple times before finally resting on an appalling claim: she had killed Travis in self-defense. Along the way, startling details emerged about the Mormon coupleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship, and soon graphic stories of their lurid sexual encounters and jealousy-driven blowouts revealed a dark side to their life together. These revelations launched a trial filled with sex and deception but also raised substantial questions about AriasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deceit, as people from across the country struggled to understand the bizarre world of Jodi Arias.\n\nNow, award-winning broadcast journalist and bestselling author Jane Velez-Mitchell, a veteran of some of the most storied court cases in recent memory, goes behind the scenes of the trial and into the mind of a killer. Using insider accounts from friends who knew Travis and Jodi, Velez-Mitchell turns her sharply-focused lens on Arias and offers her seasoned perspective on the caseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most pressing questions. Separating fact from fiction, she reports on the bizarre and explicit stories that have both shocked and fascinated the American publicÃ¢â‚¬â€from JodiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s romantic history before meeting Travis, to their torrid sex life together, to the complicated role their Mormon faith played in the relationshipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demise. With unbridled access to the evidence and the caseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key players, Velez-Mitchell unearths JodiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contentious life with those closest to her, examining the paranoid and erratic behavior behind each relationship and illustrating the disturbing pattern of a murderer in the making.\n\nComplete with photos from the case and Jane Velez-MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fresh insights on the crime, Exposed takes readers behind closed bedroom doors to uncover the truth behind the secret and sordid life of Jodi Arias.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b2c4004a8d9c7c72f13c57e0e120d959515bd4","amp;dn":"Exposed+The+Secret+Life+of+Jodi+Arias%2C+Jane+by+Jane+Velez-Mitche","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b2c4004a8d9c7c72f13c57e0e120d959515bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,178,196,0,74,141,156,124,114,241,60,87,224,225,32,217,89,81,91,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
