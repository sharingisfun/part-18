However, none deserves the title more than Jimmy Scott.\n\nMore vocalists, especially females, including myself, have patterned their styles from little Jimmy Scott.\n\nOn this album Jimmy reads the lyric of each tune as if he has lived the situation. He is without a doubt the master of the ballad form. I could go on and on extolling the merits of this balladeer, but I suggest you listen, and if you've never heard Jimmy Scott before, you will get what I mean.\n\n-Nancy Wilson\n\n\nRIP JIMMY SCOTT \n\nJuly 17, 1925 - June 12, 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01a894fade447350345118a2df92cadda25b376d","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Scott+-+The+Source+%281970%29+Atlantic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01a894fade447350345118a2df92cadda25b376d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,168,148,250,222,68,115,80,52,81,24,162,223,146,202,221,162,91,55,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
