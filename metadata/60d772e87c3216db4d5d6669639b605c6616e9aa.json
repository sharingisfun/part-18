Yet when not on the stage or in a rehearsal, Harry retreats into an insecure and painfully shy personality. The story is set in motion when Helene Walsh (Susan Sarandon), a woman intending to stay in town for only a few weeks, is talked into auditioning for the role of Stella, opposite Harry's Stanley Kowalski in a production of A Streetcar Named Desire. Ignoring warnings of Harry's introverted personality, Helene falls in love with Harry's &quot;Stanley&quot; persona, and mistakes his cluelessness and shyness for rejection. This results in a clumsy and uneven performance on the second night of the play, but Helene bounces back in time for closing night, due to an inspiration; her closing-night gift to Harry is a copy of Romeo and Juliet. Harry and Helene find that they can pursue a relationship by reciting stage romances to each other, and the story ends with him proposing in character, from a scene in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest.\n\nThe film's score was composed by John Cale of The Velvet Underground. Hinckley, Illinois served as stand-in for fictional North Crawford.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60d772e87c3216db4d5d6669639b605c6616e9aa","amp;dn":"Who+Am+I+This+Time+%28TV%29+%5B1982%5D+Jonathan+Demme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60d772e87c3216db4d5d6669639b605c6616e9aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,215,114,232,124,50,22,219,77,93,102,105,99,155,96,92,102,22,233,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
