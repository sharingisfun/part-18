Jonathan Glover finds disturbing similarities in the psychology of those involved with atrocities, yet offers hope that the development of a political and personal moral imagination can empower us to resist all acts of cruelty.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5c01998e16099b204545bae703c044f86336ffa","amp;dn":"+Humanity%3A+A+Moral+History+of+the+Twentieth+Century","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5c01998e16099b204545bae703c044f86336ffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,192,25,152,225,96,153,178,4,84,91,174,112,60,4,79,134,51,111,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
