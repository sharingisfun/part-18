It offers a powerful combination of performance and abstraction that other languages donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have. You can use C++ to write different kinds of applications for a variety of platforms. In this course, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll cover basics of language syntax Ã¢â‚¬â€œ declaring variables, classes, building expressions using operators and functions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and work up to templates, pointers, const, and polymorphism. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be using the principles of Ã¢â‚¬Å“modern C++Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as much as possible, relying on the Standard Library and using idioms like Resource Acquisition is Initialization to reduce the effort involved in memory management. Some people are scared of C++, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll show you how to approach the language without fear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa02e3dd7a02fe4949be1c6ea0a605919b56e439","amp;dn":"PluralSight+-+C%2B%2BFundamentals+%3A+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa02e3dd7a02fe4949be1c6ea0a605919b56e439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,2,227,221,122,2,254,73,73,190,28,110,160,166,5,145,155,86,228,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
