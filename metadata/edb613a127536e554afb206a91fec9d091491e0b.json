OpenOffice just fakes them and does a terrible job. Which will make documents from your boss, friends, and students look like garbage.\n\nThese are the official MSFT fonts. Just install them as usual. (Drag to Font Book in OSX)  These will work on Linux as well, but I don't know how to install them.\n\nCalibri, Cambria, Candara, Consolas, Constantia, Corbel\n\nEnjoy. \nvideoclub2000 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edb613a127536e554afb206a91fec9d091491e0b","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+2008+Fonts+TTF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edb613a127536e554afb206a91fec9d091491e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,182,19,161,39,83,110,85,74,251,32,106,145,254,201,208,145,73,30,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
