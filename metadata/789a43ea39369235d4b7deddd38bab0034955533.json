Among them were 8 paintings by Paul CÃƒÂ©zanne, 3 by Claude Monet, 3 by Auguste Renoir, 9 by Paul Gauguin, 3 by Vincent van Gogh, 6 by Henri Matisse, and 8 by Pablo Picasso. Most of these works were originally from the Shchukin and Morosov collections. An additional painting by Matisse, Harmony in Red, was seen only in Washington. In exchange, the Russians received 40 impressionist and post-impressionist paintings from the National Gallery and 127 paintings and drawings from the Armand Hammer collection for exhibition in the Soviet Union. Gaillard Ravenel and Mark Leithauser designed the exhibition, and Gordon Anson designed the lighting for the National Gallery. Funding was provided by Occidental Petroleum Corporation. The exchange of exhibitions between the Soviet Union and the United States was supported by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:789a43ea39369235d4b7deddd38bab0034955533","amp;dn":"Impressionist+to+Early+Modern+Paintings+From+the+USSR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"789a43ea39369235d4b7deddd38bab0034955533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,154,67,234,57,54,146,53,212,183,222,221,211,139,171,0,52,149,85,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
