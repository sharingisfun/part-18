The project was active for just one album,\nSo Red the Rose, which was certified Platinum in the United States and included the hit single &quot;Election Day&quot;.\nDrummer Roger Taylor appeared in only a few band photographs and in none of the music videos, and stated\nhe was only to be involved in the recording side of the project (he also had minor involvement in\nThe Power Station, the other Duran Duran splinter group formed by Duran Duran members Andy and John Taylor\nalongside Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson of Chic).\n\nThe name of the band was reportedly inspired by the Nicolas Poussin painting Et in Arcadia ego\n(also known as &quot;The Arcadian Shepherds&quot;). At the same time that So Red the Rose was in production,\nAsia were recording their third album, also tentatively titled &quot;Arcadia&quot;. Prior to release, Asia renamed\ntheir project &quot;Astra&quot; to avoid confusion.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/60748813963243092550.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/60748813963243092550.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTrack List (Disc 1)\n\n01.
