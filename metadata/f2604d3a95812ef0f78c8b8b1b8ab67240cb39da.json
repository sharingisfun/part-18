Will appreciate it. Thanks for sharing.\n=================================================================================\n\nGary Zukav ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Dancing Wu Li Masters: An Overview of the New Physics&quot; \n\nMass Market Paperback: 339 pages\nPublisher: Bantam (September 1, 1984)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 055326382X\nISBN-13: 978-0553263824\n\nGary Zukav has written &quot;the Bible&quot; for those who are curious about the mind-expanding discoveries of advanced physics, but who have no scientific background. Like a Wu Li Master who would teach us wonder for the falling petal before speaking of gravity, Zukav writes in beautifully clear language--with no mathematical equations--opening our minds to the exciting new theories that are beginning to embrace the ultimate nature of our universe...Quantum mechanics, relativity, and beyond to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect and Bell's theorem.\n\nAmazon.com Review:\nAt an Esalen Institute meeting in 1976, tai chi master Al Huang said that the Chinese word for physics is Wu Li, &quot;patterns of organic energy.&quot; Journalist Gary Zukav and the others present developed the idea of physics as the dance of the Wu Li Masters--the teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further:\nThe Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it.\nThe &quot;new physics&quot; of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction. The Dancing Wu Li Masters remains an engaging, accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. --Mary Ellen Curtin\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nThe Dancing Wu Li Masters by Gary Zukav is a popular new age book from 1979 about mysticist interpretations of quantum physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2604d3a95812ef0f78c8b8b1b8ab67240cb39da","amp;dn":"The+Dancing+Wu+Li+Masters%3A+An+Overview+of+the+New+Physics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2604d3a95812ef0f78c8b8b1b8ab67240cb39da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,96,77,58,149,129,46,240,247,140,139,139,27,138,182,114,64,203,57,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
