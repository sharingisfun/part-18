The authors cover the various materials used by civil and construction engineers in one useful reference, limiting the vast amount of information available to the introductory level, concentrating on current practices, and extracting information that is relevant to the general education of civil and construction engineers. A large number of experiments, figures, sample problems, test methods, and homework problems gives students opportunity for practice and review.\n\n\n    *\n\n      Covers all commonly used construction materials:\n          o Steel\n          o Aggregates\n          o Masonry\n          o Wood\n          o Aluminum\n          o Concrete\n          o Asphalt\n          o Composites\n          o plus high-performance materials such as fiber-reinforced composites and plastics\n\n    * Emphasizes both quantitative and qualitative properties of materials\n    * Reviews basic engineering and microstructural properties of materials\n    * Presents laboratory experiments and tests\n    * Provides example problems and worked review questions for each chapter \n\n\n\n    * Hardcover: 600 pages\n    * Publisher: Prentice Hall; 3 edition (February 27, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0136110584\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0136110583","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ede97210a1a156172ee8cbc735ced66ef43a9d3","amp;dn":"Materials+for+Civil+and+Construction+Engineers%2C3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ede97210a1a156172ee8cbc735ced66ef43a9d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,222,151,33,10,26,21,97,114,238,140,188,115,92,237,102,239,67,169,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
