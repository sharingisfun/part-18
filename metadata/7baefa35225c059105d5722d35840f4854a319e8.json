Recently widowed Mary Bassett (Helene Joy) and her 3 children have hit difficult times on their farm. Things are so bad this year that they cannot even afford a turkey for their Thanksgiving dinner. Suddenly, MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealthy and estranged mother Isabella (Jacqueline Bisset) has come to visit. Although she finds a kindred spirit in MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eldest daughter and budding writer Tilly (Tatiana Maslany), Mary resents her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempts to help them out of their financial difficulties. In the end, more than money will be needed to heal the emotional wounds that exist between mother and daughter in this moving period drama.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217590/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217590/&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.hallmarkchannel.com/Programm/Default_Microsite.aspx?Simscode=419-25591&amp;ID=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.hallmarkchannel.com/Programm/Default_Microsite.aspx?Simscode=419-25591&amp;ID=0&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\nJacqueline Bisset has undertaken a diverse range of dramatic and comedic challenges in the more than 50 films in which she has appeared, moving easily from theatrical to TV films in the US as well as in Europe, where she is equally at home performing in both English and French. Her emergence as one of the international film worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most lustrous stars once landed her on the covers of both Newsweek and People in the same week.\nThe Born Jacqueline Fraser-Bisset in Weybridge, Surrey, England, her father was a Scottish doctor and her French mother a lawyer. Modeling assignments led to small parts in features, such as Richard LesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Knack,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arividerchi Baby,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a featured role in Roman PolanskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cul-De-Sac.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It was the 1967 James Bond spoof Ã¢â‚¬Å“Casino RoyalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that won Bisset a long-term contract at 20th Century Fox. An impressive list of films followed in short order, including Stanley DonenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TWO Ã¢â‚¬Å“Two For the Road,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Sweet RideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bullit,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Airport.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Other roles which added to her international stardom included Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Thief Who Came to Dinner,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Greek Tycoon,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Sydney LumetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Murder on the Orient Express.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nHer work in 1984Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Under the Volcano,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ John HustonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adaptation of the modern classic Malcom Lowry novel brought Bisset some of the most laudatory reviews of her career, in addition to a Golden Globe nomination for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best Dramatic Actress.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Her most recent film, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death In Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ directed by Boaz Yakim (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Remember The TitansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), has resonated at numerous festivals and the following observation by famed columnist Liz Smith: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Death in LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was a wow in Sundance. Jacqueline Bisset, all agree, is a revelation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nIn 2007, the prestigious Chicago Film Festival presented her with its Career Achievement Award.
