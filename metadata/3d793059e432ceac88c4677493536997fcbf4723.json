Originally dubbed the Val-Aires, the foursome eventually signed to the tiny Co &amp; Ce label, reaching the number four spot in the autumn of 1965 with &quot;You're the One&quot;; the Vogues' most memorable hit, the classic &quot;Five O'Clock World,&quot; cracked the Top Five before the year ended as well. Two more Top 40 entries, &quot;Magic Town&quot; and &quot;The Land of Milk and Honey,&quot; followed in 1966, and when the group resurfaced in 1968 with the Top Ten smash &quot;Turn Around, Look at Me,&quot; they had jumped to major label Reprise. The single, the Vogues' lone million-seller, anticipated the lighter, more sophisticated approach of subsequent hits like &quot;My Special Angel,&quot; &quot;Till,&quot; and &quot;No, Not Much.&quot; Despite no further chart action from 1970 onward, various Vogues lineups continued touring oldies circuits for years to come. \n\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.
