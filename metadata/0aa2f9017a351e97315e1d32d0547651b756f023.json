Hall self-published this massive tome in 1928, consisting of about 200 legal-sized pages in 8 point type; it is literally his magnum opus. Each of the nearly 50 chapters is so dense with information that it is the equivalent of an entire short book. If you read this book in its entirety you will be in a good position to dive into subjects such as the Qabbala, Alchemy, Tarot, Ceremonial Magic, Neo-Platonic Philosophy, Mystery Religions, and the theory of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. Although there are some questionable and controversial parts of the book, such as the outdated material on Islam, the portion on the Bacon-Shakespeare hypothesis, and Hall's conspiracy theory of history as driven by an elite cabal of roving immortals, they are far out-weighed by the comprehensive information here on other subjects.&quot;\n\nTable of Contents: \n\nPublisher's Preface; Preface; Introduction; The Ancient Mysteries And Secret Societies Which Have Influenced Modern Masonic Symbolism; The Ancient Mysteries And Secret Societies, Part Two; The Ancient Mysteries And Secret Societies, Part Three; Atlantis And The Gods Of Antiquity; The Life And Teachings Of Thoth Hermes Trismegistus; The Initiation Of The Pyramid; Isis, The virgin Of The World; The Sun, A Universal Deity; The Zodiac And Its Signs; The Terbembine Table Of Isis; Wonders Of Antiquity; The Life And Philosophy Of Pythagoras; Pythagorean Mathematics; The Human Body In Symbolism; The Hiramic Legend; The Pythagorean Theory Of Music And Color; Fishes, Insects, Animals, Reptiles And Birds (part One); Fishes, Insects, Animals, Reptiles And Birds (part Two); Flowers, Plants, Fruits, And Trees; Stones, Metals And Gems; Ceremonial Magic And Sorcery; The Elements And Their Inhabitants; Hermetic Pharmacology, Chemistry, And Therapeutics; The Qabbalah, The Secret Doctrine Of Israel; Fundamentals Of Qabbalistic Cosmogony; The Tree Of The Sephiroth; Qabbalistic Keys To The Creation Of Man; An Analysis Of Tarot Cards; The Tabernacle In The Wilderness; The Fraternity Of The Rose Cross; Rosicrucian Doctrines And Tenets; Fifteen Rosicrucian And Qabbalistic Diagrams; Alchemy And Its Exponents; The Theory And Practice Of Alchemy: Part One; The Theory And Practice Of Alchemy: Part Two; The Hermetic And Alchemical Figures Of Claudius De Dominico Celentano Vallis Novi; The Chemical Marriage; Bacon, Shakspere, And The Rosicrucians; The Cryptogram As A Factor In Symbolic Philosophy; Freemasonic Symbolism; Mystic Christianity; The Cross And The Crucifixion; The Mystery Of The Apocalypse; The Faith Of Islam; American Indian Symbolism; The Mysteries And Their Emissaries; Conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa2f9017a351e97315e1d32d0547651b756f023","amp;dn":"The_Secret_Teachings_of_All_Ages_Manly_P_Hall_1928.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa2f9017a351e97315e1d32d0547651b756f023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,162,249,1,122,53,30,151,49,94,29,50,208,84,118,81,183,86,240,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
