Filled with self-hatred, he keeps a video diary where he discusses his own shortcomings and what he thinks is wrong in contemporary society. His bitterness spills over at a dinner party attended by his old college friends, an occasion which sends him running to a nearby brothel, where he meets Liza (Lee), a young prostitute.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1e65f957cb4b8f329c5c9e3ce212d7bf0dd43a5","amp;dn":"Notes+From+Underground+1995+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1e65f957cb4b8f329c5c9e3ce212d7bf0dd43a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,230,95,149,124,180,184,243,41,197,201,227,206,33,45,123,240,221,67,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
