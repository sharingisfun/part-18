A pear stands in for a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chin. Citrus fruits sprout from a tree trunk that doubles as a neck. All sorts of natural phenomena come together on canvas and panel to assemble the strange heads and faces that constitute one of Renaissance artÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most striking oeuvres.\nThe first major study in a generation of the artist behind these remarkable paintings, Arcimboldo tells the singular story of their creation.\n\nDrawing on his thirty-five-year engagement with the artist, Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann begins with an overview of ArcimboldoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and work, exploring the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early years in sixteenth-century Lombardy, his grounding in Leonardesque traditions, and his tenure as a Habsburg court portraitist in Vienna and Prague. Arcimboldo then trains its focus on the celebrated composite heads, approaching them as visual jokes with serious underpinningsÃ¢â‚¬â€images that poetically display pictorial wit while conveying an allegorical message. In addition to probing the humanistic, literary, and philosophical dimensions of these pieces, Kaufmann explains that they embody their creatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuous engagement with nature painting and natural history. He reveals, in fact, that Arcimboldo painted many more nature studies than scholars have realizedÃ¢â‚¬â€a finding that significantly deepens current interpretations of the composite heads.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b81c811ab680dd30fe2e06eafa7df0a589021a1","amp;dn":"Arcimboldo%3A+Visual+Jokes%2C+Natural+History%2C+and+Still-Life+Painti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b81c811ab680dd30fe2e06eafa7df0a589021a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,129,200,17,171,104,13,211,15,226,224,110,175,167,223,10,88,144,33,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
