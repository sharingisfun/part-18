The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“practicalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ aspect of the book rests primarily on the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s method of starting at the beginning of the topic and proceeding to advanced material, while including all the stages that lead to important results. This book encompasses an approach that remains as close as possible to familiar concepts of vectors, tensors and reference systems in the hope of capitalizing on received wisdom. \nPresented in six chapters, each chapter takes a logical step on the way to relativistic electromagnetism and gravity. \n\n\nChapter topics are: \n\nNon-relativity for Relativists \nInvariance of Physical Law Under Change of Inertial Frame of Reference \nImplications: Using and Understanding the Lorentz Transformations \nElectromagnetic Theory in Space-time \nGravitational Structure of Space-time \nThe Measure of Space-time \nProblems and examples are included throughout the book and a solutions manual is available at www.wiley.com/go/henriksen. \n\nThis book may be used as lecture material for a course on special relativity and gravitation at an undergraduate and graduate level, and will appeal to students studying for both physics and astronomy. In addition, it will be a useful source book for physicists, astronomers and engineers. \n\nPaperback: 280 pages \nPublisher: Wiley (December 21, 2010) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d734855bcc23013a7a867f80086ef597ceb04f1b","amp;dn":"Practical+Relativity%3A+From+First+Principles+to+the+Theory+of+Gra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d734855bcc23013a7a867f80086ef597ceb04f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,52,133,91,204,35,1,58,122,134,127,128,8,110,245,151,206,176,79,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
