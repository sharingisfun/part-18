Produced by Grammy Award winning producer Joe Chiccarelli (The White Stripes, My Morning Jacket), OMNI showcases the quintet's remarkable gift to craft visionary and gripping compositions, and with the assistance of Chiccarelli, revealing new layers in their songwriting as they pursue the next level in their inimitable musical style. With the exploration of erotic themes and fascinating tales of human sexual relationships, OMNI is a riveting new album of rich soundscapes illustrated by Minus The Bear's trademark precision and tremendous growth as artistic lyricists and songwriters. Beginning April 21st, Minus the Bear will embark on a 6-week North American tour premiering these new tracks. Dates to be announced shortly. OMNI marks the first release for the band on Dangerbird Records.\n\nWith deep bass lines, mesmerizing syncopated guitar riffs, provocative lyrics and stimulating keyboards, OMNI explodes with a bursting energy and unpredictable experimentation. From lead-off single, MY TIME, which explores the band's widescreen synth rock, to the punch of dueling guitars and keyboards on THE THIEF, from the intense psychedelicia of ANIMAL BACKWARDS to the driving rock of HOLD ME DOWN, OMNI continues Minus The Bear's shape-shifting evolution and is a culmination of their past influences and present inspirations.\n\nOver the years, Minus the Bear has won over legions of fans and critics with an exhilarating live show and a sound that is uniquely their own. With a devoted fan base, Minus the Bear sell out 2000-capacity venues nationwide whether on or off album cycle, have generated more than 13 million plays on MySpace, and continuously release new material (EPs and singles) to fan and critical acclaim. \n\nTour dates, track listing and more news to be announced shortly. \n\nwww.minusthebear.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4194979ca328fc3c41d957876d7ba9ea45954b0d","amp;dn":"Minus+the+Bear+-+My+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4194979ca328fc3c41d957876d7ba9ea45954b0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,148,151,156,163,40,252,60,65,217,87,135,109,123,169,234,69,149,75,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
