If you guessed Midnight Oil, you probably have the most supporters. But for my money, there's never been an Australian rock &amp; roll band better (or more consistent) than Sydney's Celibate Rifles. Playing stripped-down, loud, and fast Ramones-inspired guitar rock, the Celibate Rifles were one of the earliest punk bands to emerge during the post-Radio Birdman/Saints era. Taking their cues from these Aussie bands, along with the American hard rock of the Stooges, MC5, and Blue Oyster Cult, the Rifles were led by the twin-guitar attack of Kent Steedman and Dave Morris, and the deadpan baritone of vocalist Damien Lovelock. They exploded out of the gates in 1982 with a series of records (released in Australia only) fueled by high-speed guitars, wah-wah-strangulated solos, and cartoon-ish, tongue-in-cheek lyrics.\n\nIf nothing else, the Celibate Rifles' eponymously-titled second album makes it quite plain that it is no longer possible to dismiss this Sydney group as mere three-chord-thrasharama. But more than that, the fact is that this is a bloody good album, wherein the Rifles move away from the restrictions of their roots, palpably growing before your very eyes, and that's not a compliment I use lightly.
