The books feature a reporter named Jim Qwilleran (Qwill to most) and his Siamese cats: Kao K'o-Kung (Koko for short) and Yum-Yum. Qwill uses his experience as a reporter, and Koko's suspected ESP, to help solve mysteries that the authorities can't figure out.\n\nThis is the (essentially) complete collection of Lilian Jackson Braun's wonderful &quot;The Cat Who&quot; series of mystery books! The unfinished, never-published 30th book, &quot;The Cat Who Smelled Smoke,&quot; and &quot;The Private Life of the Cat Who ...: Tales of Koko and Yum Yum (from the Journals of James Mackintosh Qwilleran),&quot; which is mostly just excerpts from earlier books, are all that are missing. Likewise, the five related books by other authors (&quot;The Cat Who...Companion,&quot; &quot;The Cat Who... Quiz Book,&quot; &quot;The Cat Who... Cookbook,&quot; &quot;The Cat Who... Reunion Cookbook&quot; and &quot;&quot;The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun&quot;) are not included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef20eefdfee4d20879658c6df1e2c06b020667d","amp;dn":"Lilian+Jackson+Braun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef20eefdfee4d20879658c6df1e2c06b020667d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,242,14,239,223,238,77,32,135,150,88,198,223,30,44,6,176,32,102,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
