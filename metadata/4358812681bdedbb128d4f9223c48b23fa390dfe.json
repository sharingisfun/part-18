Their 11th studio album, Forevermore was recorded, produced and mixed by Coverdale, guitarist Doug Aldrich and Michael McIntyre at Snakebyte Studios and Grumblenott Studios &amp; Villas in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, with additional work at Casa Dala, Sherman Oaks, CA, and Whitesnake will take to the road for a full world tour in support of the release. Formed in 1977, and steered by the legendary Coverdale, Whitesnake carry a rightful reputation as one of the world s leading rock n roll bands. Coverdale s blues roots, combined with a feral sense of rockin and rollin , have consistently shaped the Snake s sound, and add to that Coverdale s love and appreciation of impeccable musicianship and you have a failsafe recipe for success. Their ascent to the very top of the rock n roll tree was confirmed with 1987 s self-titled multi-platinum album, which saw two top 10 hits, two number one singles with Here I Go Again and Is This Love and a virtual 24 hour domination of MTV around the world. Such triumphs were surely foretold when as a young man from Saltburn-By-Sea, Coverdale enthusiastically answered the call to be Deep Purple s singer. Such bombast, bravado, talent and passion have thus helped establish Whitesnake as the perennial platinum favourite they have become. With Forevermore Coverdale has reignited an explosively fruitful vein of creativity with guitarist and co-writer/producer Aldrich, Reb Beach (Winger, Alice Cooper) on guitar, Brian Tichy (Ozzy, Billy Idol, Foreigner) on drums and Michael Devin (Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Lynch Mob) on bass, and as with all Whitesnake s albums, Coverdale (aided so capably by Aldrich) opens up his heart and soul to express emotions and empathy rarely heard these days in any musical genre. More than simply their latest release, Forevermore represents Whitesnake s no holds barred, most heartfelt, melodic and musically muscular excursion for many a year. The album s release will be anticipated by the digital only release of the first single/videoclip Love Will Set You Free on February 21st. The videoclip of the song will be included, along with a documentary about the album recording sessions also including extensive interviews with David Coverdale and the other band members - on a DVD which will accompany the release of the album. Forevermore will be specially released on a Snake pack edition for the first 3 weeks in England only. This very special release arranged in conjunction with Future Publishing and Classic Rock magazine - will come with a collectors edition 132 pages deluxe magazine + A1 poster &amp; metal pin badge and shall feature an exclusive cover art and 2 bonus live tracks Slide It In and Cheap An Nasty which will serve as an appetizer for the forthcoming Live at Donington 1990 DVD to be released in the summer 2011. This time Coverdale and Co. have really laid it on the line for their fans, and be sure of this, the Snake s charms are going to convert a whole new army of believers... just watch. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4358812681bdedbb128d4f9223c48b23fa390dfe","amp;dn":"Whitesnake+2011+Forevermore+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4358812681bdedbb128d4f9223c48b23fa390dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,88,129,38,129,189,237,187,18,141,79,146,35,196,139,35,250,57,13,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
