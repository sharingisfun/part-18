This time three contemporary families live as their own forebears did. They must follow the social conventions of the time, but whether they're destined for luxury or poverty is determined by their family history, which is a nice touch. You just know the posh family (the Meadows) are going to end up in the working-class house but they take to the hardship well, even though daughter Saskia reveals, &quot;I thought we'd do chores when we were on camera but when you said cut, we'd go off, have a chat and a bit of food. This is a bit of a shock.&quot; The other families struggle for very different reasons. It seems that living history is a bit harsher than those sepia-tinted photos would have us believe.\n\n\n\n4)  1960s \nIn this episode, the families are thrown into the swinging sixties and the street is introduced to a new family, the Hawkes, who are walking in the shoes of their ancestors who arrived as immigrants from the Caribbean. Brother and sister Jonathan and Rachel arrive on Albert Road first, and are shocked by life in the sixties. They discover life in the sixties was a difficult time, with racism, isolation and separation from loved ones taking its toll. The Meadows family follow their ancestors' climb up the social ladder from their traditional working class home in the forties to a sixties middle-class dwelling. All appears well, until sisters Saskia and Genevieve spoil the party with a teenage rebellion. And the twists and turns of the Taylor family tree mean they leave behind the high life they have lived since the 1900s, as they find themselves in the working class house.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1619 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04857659beb43590b180255c32984ecd81feefe","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+Family+4of5+1960s+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04857659beb43590b180255c32984ecd81feefe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,72,87,101,155,235,67,89,11,24,2,85,195,41,132,236,216,31,238,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
