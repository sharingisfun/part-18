These on-location workshops are usually reserved for a handful of photographers each year, but now you can learn the same techniques that Joe shares in his seminars and lectures in a book that brings JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sessions to life.\n\nWhat makes the book so unique is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtriangle of learningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where (1) Joe distills the concept down to one brief sentence. It usually starts with something like, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAn editor at National Geographic once told meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and then he shares one of those hard-earned tricks of the trade that you only get from spending a lifetime behind the lens. Then, (2) on the facing page is one of JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brilliant images that perfectly illustrates the technique (youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll recognize many of his photos from magazine covers). And (3) you get the inside story of how that shot was taken, including which equipment he used (lens, f/stop, lighting, accessories, etc.), along with the challenges that type of project brings, and how to set up a shot like that of your own.\n\nThis book also gives you something more. It inspires. It challenges. It informs. But perhaps most importantly, it will help you understand photography and the art of making great photos at a level you never thought possible. This book is packed with those ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAh ha!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ momentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½those clever insights that make it all come together for you. It brings you that wonderful moment when it suddenly all makes senseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmoment it clicks.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d6c7e94ff081ce0d3a4dd2fcb533e8f0c74c8ee","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2008%5D+The+Moment+It+Clicks%2C+Photography+secrets+from+one+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d6c7e94ff081ce0d3a4dd2fcb533e8f0c74c8ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,108,126,148,255,8,28,224,211,164,221,47,203,83,62,143,12,116,200,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
