He had his choice of guitar players, but I came in and played the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Beat ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ solo for him. Afterward he was so happy he got up and grabbed my arm and started walking up and down the stage area with me. He said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Can you play once for me?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ He hired me that night. I wish he was still around. He made me believe in myself more, and I learned so much. Going into it, I thought it would be all about playing guitar solos. But the majority of it was playing chords and funky rhythms.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nShe played and sang at Jackson's memorial, globally televised live on 7 July 2009.
