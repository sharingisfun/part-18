Presented in association with ProPublica and based on reporter Abrahm Lustgartenâ€™s award-winning series of the same name, the film presents the grim reality that 40 million Americans could soon be without enough water and proposes innovative solutions to preserve this precious resource for future generations. KILLING THE COLORADO features compelling insights from senior research scientists, water resource experts, federal government officials, industrial farmers, and state leaders at the forefront of the water crisis, including Gov. John Hickenlooper (CO-D), Sen. Jeff Flake (AZ-R), and Mike Connor, U.S Deputy Secretary of the Interior. Premiering as part of DISCOVERY IMPACT, a series of groundbreaking documentaries that illuminate the most critical environmental threats we face, with a focus on what individuals and society can do to protect our planet, KILLING THE COLORADO.[/i][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aa6642ae7dce017e7918ce2eb119c3f2ca08725","amp;dn":"Killing+the+Colorado+2016++HDTV+x264-RBB%5Bstate%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aa6642ae7dce017e7918ce2eb119c3f2ca08725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,166,100,42,231,220,224,23,231,145,140,226,235,17,156,63,44,160,135,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
