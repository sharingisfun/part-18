It is missing some of the lower level books because they are special rutgers edition or need some fuckin online access card anyway. Most of the books are the correct edition but these things change so watch out for that I guess. There are also a couple solutions manuals. Though this torrent is made specifically for rutgers students many of the books are standard so this torrent will most likely be useful to any physics and math student.
