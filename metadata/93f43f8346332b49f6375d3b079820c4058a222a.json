While the first, Yesterdays, mainly centred on their formative period, Classic Yes is exactly what it promises, a summation of the best moments during Yes&amp;#039; initial run as a group.\n\nOriginally released as a single LP with a bonus 45 RPM disc featuring live versions of &quot;Roundabout&quot; and &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Seen All Good People&quot; from 1978, everything has been compiled onto one handy CD. It was taken out of circulation by 2003.\n\nAlthough it was initially not a strong seller, Classic Yes ultimately went platinum in the US and still remains the ideal entry point for Yes novices.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; (Jon Anderson/Chris Squire/Bill Bruford) ? 10:35\n   2. &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; (Jon Anderson) ? 3:50\n   3. &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; (Jon Anderson/Chris Squire/Steve Howe/Tony Kaye/Bill Bruford) ? 9:41\n   4. &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; ? 9:25\n         1. &quot;Life Seeker&quot; (Jon Anderson)\n         2. &quot;Disillusion&quot; (Chris Squire)\n         3. &quot;WÃƒÂ¼rm&quot; (Steve Howe)\n   5. &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot; (Jon Anderson) ? 3:30\n   6. &quot;The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)&quot; (Chris Squire) ? 2:37\n   7. &quot;And You and I&quot; (Jon Anderson; Themes by Bill Bruford/Steve Howe/Chris Squire) ? 10:05\n         1. &quot;Cord of Life&quot;\n         2. &quot;Eclipse&quot;\n         3. &quot;The Preacher the Teacher&quot;\n         4. &quot;Apocalypse&quot;\n   8. &quot;Roundabout&quot; (Jon Anderson/Steve Howe) ? 7:53\n   9. &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Seen All Good People&quot; ? 7:29\n         1. &quot;Your Move&quot; (Jon Anderson)\n         2. &quot;All Good People&quot; (Chris Squire)\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Jon Anderson: Vocals\n    * Chris Squire: Bass guitar, vocals, compiler\n    * Steve Howe: Guitars, vocals\n    * Tony Kaye: Keyboards (on tracks 3 and 4)\n    * Rick Wakeman: Keyboards (everything else)\n    * Alan White: Drums, vocals (on tracks 2, 8, and 9)\n    * Bill Bruford: Drums, vocals (everything else)\n\n\nKids, always remember Xenu is your friend.\n\nwww.xenu.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f43f8346332b49f6375d3b079820c4058a222a","amp;dn":"%5BProgressive+Rock%5D+Yes+-+CLASSIC+YES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f43f8346332b49f6375d3b079820c4058a222a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,244,63,131,70,51,43,73,246,55,93,59,7,152,32,196,5,138,34,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
