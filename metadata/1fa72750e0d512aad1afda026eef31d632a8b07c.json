Singer/guitarist Jeff Ott's lyrics focus on social justice and issues such as homelessness, drug abuse, environmental destruction, and government strong-arm tactics. Many of the themes that his songs deal with seem to be pulled from his own experience; sexually abused as a child, he left home at 13 and lived the life of a gutter punk on the streets for 11 years. Other bandmembers had their own struggles; their 1999 album Lucky was named after a former bassist who killed himself after suffering from an amphetamine addiction. Other albums included three apiece for Grass and Lookout Records, as well as their self-produced album, Extra Medium Kickball All-Star. In the summer of 2000, the band released an EP with Sub City Records, Hush. Fifteen followed up several months later with the full-length Survivor. Kickball All-Star was reissued in fall 2003 with appended tracks as a benefit for the organization Any Positive Change, which worked to prevent the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C through needles.\n\n  *Note to downloaders\n\n  I don't claim that this is a complete discography. I have collected as much material as I could find.  If something is missing you can try to find it and upload it for the community; asking for it here won't help.\n\n  Thanks to all the original rippers and uploaders. :)\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa72750e0d512aad1afda026eef31d632a8b07c","amp;dn":"Fifteen+-+Discography+%281991-2003%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fa72750e0d512aad1afda026eef31d632a8b07c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,167,39,80,224,213,18,170,209,175,218,2,110,239,49,214,50,168,176,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
