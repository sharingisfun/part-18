Previously written by Gareth Williams and John Pickup, the book has been completely revised by Rudy Bilous and Richard Donnelly to reflect recent changes in diabetes treatment and care. It contains information on the new IFCC units for measuring blood glucose and the latest drugs being used to combat diabetes, as well as alternative methods of insulin delivery.\n\nThe book has been fully updated and redesigned to make it even more userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“friendly, and contains case histories, practice points, and landmark clinical trials highlighted in color in each chapter where appropriate. It also features an entirely new set of clinical photographs, and all 250 images from the book can be downloaded from the companion CD for use in presentations.\n\nThe Handbook of Diabetes is the ideal practical handbook for all health professionals with an interest in diabetes care. \n\n\n# Paperback: 248 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 4th Edition edition (23 July 2010)\n# Language English\n# ISBN-10: 1405184094\n# ISBN-13: 978-1405184090","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e2024da46b7cb87de317a29501973937defddb","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Diabetes+4th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e2024da46b7cb87de317a29501973937defddb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,226,2,77,164,107,124,184,125,227,23,162,149,1,151,57,55,222,253,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
