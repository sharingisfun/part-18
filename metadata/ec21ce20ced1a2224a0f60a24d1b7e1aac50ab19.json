It's the first of a series of concept albums dedicated to different war gods from various mythologies. Gods of War is centered around Odin, King of Gods and primary god of war in the Norse Mythology. All the text on the booklet was written in the Runic alphabet. The booklet is available for download in the official Manowar site. Cover art is painted by Ken Kelly. It is the last studio album to feature Manowar drummer Scott Columbus, who died in 2011.\n\nMusic of the album features symphonic metal influence, such as use of keyboard, choir and symphonic orchestra. Its close relationship with the four-opera cycle of Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner is intended by wagnerian DeMaio, as shown by the booklet and recent interviews with Michael Custodis.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \n    &quot;Overture to the Hymn of the Immortal Warriors&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:19\n    &quot;The Ascension&quot;                                  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n    &quot;King of Kings&quot;                                  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:17\n    &quot;Army of the Dead, Part I&quot;                       Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:58\n    &quot;Sleipnir&quot;                                       Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:13\n    &quot;Loki God of Fire&quot;                               Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;                                 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:54\n    &quot;Overture to Odin&quot;                               Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41\n    &quot;The Blood of Odin&quot;                              Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:57\n    &quot;The Sons of Odin&quot;                               Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:23\n    &quot;Glory Majesty Unity&quot;                            Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:41\n    &quot;Gods of War&quot;                                    Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:25\n    &quot;Army of the Dead, Part II&quot;                      Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:20\n    &quot;Odin&quot;                                           Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:26\n    &quot;Hymn of the Immortal Warriors&quot;                  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:29\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec21ce20ced1a2224a0f60a24d1b7e1aac50ab19","amp;dn":"Manowar+-+2007+-+Gods+Of+War+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec21ce20ced1a2224a0f60a24d1b7e1aac50ab19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,33,206,32,206,209,162,34,74,15,96,162,77,27,126,26,172,80,171,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
