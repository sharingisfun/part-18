(novel) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\nAuthor\t\t\tEoin Colfer\nCountry\t\t\tUnited Kingdom, United States\nLanguage\t\tEnglish\nSeries\t\t\tThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\nGenre(s)\t\tScience fiction comedy\nPublisher\t\tPenguin Books, Hyperion Books\nPublication date\t12 October 2009\nPreceded by\t\tMostly Harmless\n\n\nAnd Another ThingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ is the title of the sixth installment of Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy &quot;trilogy.&quot; The book, written by Eoin Colfer, author of the Artemis Fowl series, was published on the thirtieth anniversary of the first book, 12 October 2009, in hardback. It was published by Penguin Books in the UK and by Hyperion Books in the US. Colfer was given permission to write the book by Adams's widow Jane Belson.\n\nUnlike the previous Hitchhiker's works, the title is not a quotation from the first novel, but taken from the third chapter of So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, where it appears in the following passage:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying &quot;And another thingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦&quot; twenty minutes after admitting he's lost the argument.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nPrior to his death, Adams had felt the need to continue the story: &quot;I suspect at some point in the future I will write a sixth Hitchhiker book...&quot;, and &quot;People have said, quite rightly, that Mostly Harmless is a very bleak book. And it was a bleak book. I would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note, so five seems to be a wrong kind of number; six is a better kind of number.&quot;\n\nIn referring to the Dirk Gently book he was then working on, Adams said, &quot;A lot of the stuff which was originally in The Salmon of Doubt really wasn't working.&quot; Before he died, Adams had planned on &quot;salvaging some of the ideas that I couldn't make work in a Dirk Gently framework and putting them in a Hitchhiker framework... and for old time's sake I may call it The Salmon of Doubt.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f4b9113635bb90839bcc90f19d1463e35e9b09f","amp;dn":"Eoin+Colfer+-+And+Another+Thing...+%28Hitchhiker%5C%27s%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f4b9113635bb90839bcc90f19d1463e35e9b09f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,75,145,19,99,91,185,8,57,188,201,15,25,209,70,62,53,233,176,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
