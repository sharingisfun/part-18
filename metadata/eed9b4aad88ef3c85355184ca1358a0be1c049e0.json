However, the collector's edition is, in my opinion, a much better choice. \nAs far as the actual music goes, it is by far one of my favorites. The live recordings capture the energy of AC/DC very well. In fact, I generally prefer the live versions to their original recorded versions. For anyone who is even marginally an AC/DC fan, or even just curious, the AC/DC live is a must have. \nThat said, the collectors edition's regular price is only an additional $4 (at the writing of this review it is discounted to $16.00). That additional $4 provides 9 extra songs which are not included on the one disc version. Therefore, it seems pointless to buy the one disc version. \nLike I said, AC/DC is an amazing band, and their live recordings are even better. I just can't recommend this CD when a far better alternative exists.\n\nby Rich\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Thunderstruck.wma                                           \n02 - Shoot To Thrill.wma                                         \n03 - Back In Black.wma                                           \n04 - Who Made Who.wma                                            \n05 - Heatseeker.wma                                              \n06 - The Jack.wma                                                \n07 - Moneytalks.wma                                              \n08 - Hells Bells.wma                                             \n09 - Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.wma                             \n10 - Whole Lotta Rosie.wma                                       \n11 - You Shook Me All Night Long.wma                             \n12 - Highway To Hell.wma                                         \n13 - T.N.T..wma                                                  \n14 - For Those About To Rock (We Salute You).wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed9b4aad88ef3c85355184ca1358a0be1c049e0","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Live+%281992%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eed9b4aad88ef3c85355184ca1358a0be1c049e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,217,180,170,216,142,243,200,83,85,24,76,161,53,138,11,225,192,73,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
