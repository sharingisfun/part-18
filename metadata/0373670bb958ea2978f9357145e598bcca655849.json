This Atlantic LP from 1962 finds Grappelli in good form in a quintet with guitarist Pierre Cavalli, performing a Django-dominated repertoire that is not all that different from what he would be playing 30 years later.\n\nTracks\n1. Django\n2. Nuages\n3. ALabamy Bound\n4. You Better Go Now\n5. Daphne\n6. Le Tien\n7. Minor Swing\n8. Makin' Whoopee\n9. How About You\n10. Soft Winds\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0373670bb958ea2978f9357145e598bcca655849","amp;dn":"Stephane+Grappelli+-+Feeling%2BFinesse%3DJazz+%281962%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%7BRHINO+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0373670bb958ea2978f9357145e598bcca655849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,115,103,11,185,88,234,41,120,249,53,113,69,229,152,188,202,101,88,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
