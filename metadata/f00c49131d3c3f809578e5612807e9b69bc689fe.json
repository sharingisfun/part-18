The heroes of the series are two children Jo and Zette Legrand and their pet monkey Jocko.\n\nIn 1935, six years after Tintin had first appeared, HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© was approached by a priest who was director of the weekly French newspaper Coeurs Vaillants (Valiant Hearts). It also published Tintin's adventures, but while Father Courtois enjoyed Tintin, he wanted a set of characters that would embody classical family values ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a young boy, with a father who works, a mother, a sister and a pet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in contrast to the more independent Tintin who, the whole of his career, has had no mention of relatives at all.\n\nInspired by a toy monkey called Jocko, HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© created Jo Legrand, his sister Zette and their pet monkey Jocko as well as their engineer father, Jacques, and housewife mother. Their first adventure, The Secret Ray, appeared in the pages of Coeurs Vaillants on January 19, 1936 and ran until June 1937.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1957, three complete Jo, Zette and Jocko adventures would be published, spread across five albums. HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© however often felt restricted by the family set-up: whereas the older, more independent Tintin could just head off on any adventure, either alone or with Captain Haddock or Professor Calculus, this was not possible for Jo, Zette and Jocko whose parents had to figure large in any adventure ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ usually to act as their rescuers. The stories also lacked the social and political messages of the Tintin stories. In the end, these constraints led him to eventually abandon Jo, Zette and Jocko in the late-1950s.\n\n**********\n\nIncluded in this torrent (in English):\n1. Mr. PumpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Legacy (Le Testament de Monsieur Pump) - Volume 1 of The Stratoship H.22\nKilled while exercising his love for speed in a racing car, millionaire John Archibald Pump leaves behind ten million dollars (a large sum in those days). It will go to the builders of the first aeroplane to fly from Paris to New York at 1000 kilometres per hour. Jo and Zette's father sets about designing such a plane, but the project comes under threat from a gang of saboteurs led by William and Fred Stockrise, Pump's passed-over nephews, who go to all lengths, from theft to bombing, to prevent it. (A framed photo of Captain Haddock can be seen hanging on the wall of the Legrand living-room just before Mr Legrand switches on the light to confront intruders.)\n2. Destination New York (Destination New York) - Volume 2 of The Stratoship H.22\nWhen the Stratoship H.22, designed by their father, is the subject of an attempted bombing from the air, Jo and Zette fly it out of its hangar but are unable to get back. Crash-landing in the North Pole they face a race against time to get the plane back home and win the trans-Atlantic challenge. But the Stockrise brothers and their gang are still determined to thwart the operation even if it is successful.\n3. The Valley of the Cobras (La VallÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e des Cobras)\nThe Maharajah of Gopal is a bad-tempered sort of person, whose behaviour ranges from the childish to the eccentric, and his long-suffering secretary Badalah is usually on the receiving end. Nevertheless, Jo and Zette's father agrees to build him a bridge in his kingdom. The problem is there is a group of scoundrels led by Prime Minister Ramahjuni and the evil fakir Rabindah who aren't too keen on the idea.\nNote: These three are available elsewhere on the Internet in CBR format. As far as I know, these are the only PDF versions.\n\nJo, Zette and Jocko adventures not included in this torrent -\nThe first two are available only in extremely limited editions in English because of racial concerns, while the third was never completed.\n1.
