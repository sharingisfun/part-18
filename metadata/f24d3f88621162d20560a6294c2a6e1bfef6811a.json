Mayday)\nDVD rip of series 1 through 11\n\nSeries 1 is voiced by David Bamber, while all the others are voiced by the\nusual Jonathan Aris (British accent).\n\nEnglish stereo only and no subtitles (none were on the DVDs).\n\nThe files are encoded in constant-quality mode so the file sizes vary quite a\nbit, depending on the amount of motion in each episode.  But I figure the days\nare long gone when each episode needed to fit on a CD-R, so it would be better\nto aim for uniform quality across all the episodes instead.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f24d3f88621162d20560a6294c2a6e1bfef6811a","amp;dn":"Air+Crash+Investigations+%28Mayday%29+Season+1-11+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f24d3f88621162d20560a6294c2a6e1bfef6811a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,77,63,136,98,17,98,210,5,96,166,41,76,42,110,27,254,246,129,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
