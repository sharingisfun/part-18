DVD\n\nThe success of any organization is usually determined by it's leader. Big Meech aka Demetrius Flenory would be the BMF (Black Mafia Family) leader that would generate in excess of $270 million dollars in what the government deemed as illegal proceeds gained with criminal activities.\n\nThe influence of Meech would reach out to the who's who of the rap world and create a floodgate of those trying to emulate and copy his lifestyle fit for a king. the story of Big Meech and BMF is one of the real true stories that can rival a part of it's own name, Mafia.
