Not Twilight Dramatic, this is September 11 dramatic. This is also the theme song of the movies Requiem For A Dream and Lord of the Rings: Two Towers. Ironically this song is a powerful requiem. It was composed by Clint Mansell. Words simply can't describe the power of this song. Enjoy.\n\nSorry about the incorrect album art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e6f83bbdfdc61b75e95e5aed3edc0a9f0e8900","amp;dn":"Lux+Aeterna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e6f83bbdfdc61b75e95e5aed3edc0a9f0e8900","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,230,248,59,189,253,198,27,117,233,94,90,237,62,220,10,159,14,137,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
