Without the knowledge of basic elements,\nengineers, designers, craftsmen, and technicians are handicapped. In some cases, they\nwould literally have to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;; thus wasting valuable time, resources and\nenergy that could and should be spent on developing new designs.\nWe are told by respected archaeological experts that the pyramids of ancient Egypt and\nprehistoric South America were built without the use of pulleys and gears; both indispensable\nmechanical components since early Greek and Roman times. However, these\nmagnificent structures were constructed, but apparently no recorded information exists\ndescribing their construction methods or erection tools they employed. Perhaps some\nunknown component, device, or mechanism was used by those ancient builders that\nremains unknown even to this day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0865cd9d831f5f1cfce65a7d1c53921859b2f7","amp;dn":"Machine+Devices+and+Components+-+Illustrated+Sourcebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f0865cd9d831f5f1cfce65a7d1c53921859b2f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,8,101,205,157,131,31,95,28,252,230,90,125,28,83,146,24,89,178,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
