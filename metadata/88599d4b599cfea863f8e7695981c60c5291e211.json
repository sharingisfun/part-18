Microsoft wants you to upgrade your edition of Windows in order to get this feature. Luckily, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little hack we can use to get it working on Home Premium. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the steps to get it working:\n\nDownload THIS TORRENT and extract it to a location on your PC.\nNavigate to the folder you just extracted and right click Install.cmd, then choose Run as administrator.\nYou can also enable multiple sessions per user, and the logging in of users with a blank password (although I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recommend this). There are some switches that are available when running the program:\n\n-? Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Show this help\nhelp Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Same as -?\nmulti Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Enable multiple sessions per user\nblank Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Enable remote log on for user accounts that are not password protected\nSo for example, if you wanted to enable multiple sessions per user:\n\nGo to start and find Command Prompt. Right click it and select Run as administrator.\nAt the prompt type cd Ã¢â‚¬Å“c:DIRECTORYTOEXTRACTEDFILESÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe prompt should switch to c:DIRECTORYTOEXTRACTEDFILES &gt;\nType: Install multi\nThanks to the guys over at Missing Remote for this hack.\n\nClipboard Sharing\n\nWhen I installed this hack, one thing I noticed was that the clipboard sharing wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t working when I first connected. What I had to do to remedy it was open up the task manager on the remote machine, end the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrdpclip.exeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ process and restart it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ either through Start &gt; RunÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ or in the task manager by going to File &gt; New Task (RunÃ¢â‚¬Â¦).\n\nYou could automate this process by creating a simple batch script if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like, similar to the one below:\n\ntaskkill /IM rdpclip.exe /F\nrdpclip.exe\n\nCopy and paste the above into notepad and save it as killrdpclip.bat (or whatever youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like). Then all you need to do is double click the batch file and you should be good to go.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88599d4b599cfea863f8e7695981c60c5291e211","amp;dn":"Enable+Remote+Desktop+Connection+on+Windows+7+Home+Premium+SP1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88599d4b599cfea863f8e7695981c60c5291e211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,89,157,75,89,156,254,168,99,248,231,105,89,129,198,12,82,145,226,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
