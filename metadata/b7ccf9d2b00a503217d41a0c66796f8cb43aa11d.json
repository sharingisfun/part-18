It consists of a\nnarrator talking through the presentation, describing what is happening on the\nscreen or stage during the natural pauses in the audio, and sometimes during\ndialogue if deemed necessary.\n\nThe technique is similar to that of an old style radio play.\n\nFor the performing arts [theater, dance, opera], and media [television, movies\nand DVD], description is a form of audio-visual translation, using the natural\npauses in dialogue or between critical sound elements to insert narrative that\ntranslates the visual image into a sense form that is accessible to millions of\nindividuals who otherwise lack full access to television and film.\n\nIn museums or visual art exhibitions, audio described tours [or universally\ndesigned tours that include description or the augmentation of existing recorded\nprograms on audio- or videotape], are used to provide access to visitors who are\nblind or have low vision. Docents or tour guides can be trained to employ audio\ndescription in their presentations. Audio description of sporting events is now\nbecoming more common, in particular at soccer stadiums.\n\nResearchers are working to show how description, through its use of varied word\nchoice, synonyms, metaphor and simile, not only benefits children who are blind\nand others who have learning disabilities but can also boost literacy for all\nchildren.\n\nA team of scientists travels through the universe on the spaceship &quot;Prometheus&quot;\non a voyage to investigate alien life forms. The team of scientists becomes stranded\non an Alien world, and as they struggle to survive it becomes clear that the horrors\nthey experience are not just a threat to themselves, but to all of mankind.\n\n\nAlbum Title: Prometheus Audio Described For The Blind\nArtist | Group: Prometheus\nLabel:\nRelease date: 2012\nGenre: Film / Adventure / Sci-Fi\nFile format: mp3 Stereo\nBitRate: 320 Kbps\nBitRate mode: CBR\nNumber of track(s): 1\nTotal duration: 02h:03m:52s:829ms\nTotal size: 283.6394 MB\n\n\n1 - Audio Described For The Blind - [2h 3mn ] [ 284 MiB ]\n\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan)\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on on 16th of December 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ccf9d2b00a503217d41a0c66796f8cb43aa11d","amp;dn":"Prometheus+2012+-+Audio+Described+For+The+Blind+%5BMP3%40320%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ccf9d2b00a503217d41a0c66796f8cb43aa11d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,204,249,210,176,10,80,50,23,212,26,12,102,121,111,140,180,58,161,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
