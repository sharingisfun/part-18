Released in the aftermath of singer Vince Neil's arrest for manslaughter on a drunk driving charge, the album marked a step away from the traditional heavy metal sound of Too Fast for Love and Shout at the Devil towards a more glam metal influenced record in both sound and image of their later albums, whilst still retaining the trademark heavy, sleazy Crue sound. \n\nThe intended title for the album was &quot;Entertainment or Death&quot;, but that was changed before the release, possibly inspired by LA Death Rock band Christian DeathÃ‚Â´s 1982 album Only Theatre of Pain\n\nTheatre of Pain contains the hits &quot;Smokin' in the Boys Room&quot; and the power ballad &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;. The album reached #6 in the US charts, and #36 in the UK. The album was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA on June 5, 1995.\n\nTheatre of Pain is dedicated to Hanoi Rocks former member Nicholas &quot;Razzle&quot; Dingley, who was killed in the car crash that resulted in Vince Neil's arrest.\n\nSave Our Souls is featured in the Italian horror film Demons which is produced by Dario Argento.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;City Boy Blues&quot;   \t \t4:10\n2. \t&quot;Smokin' in the Boys Room&quot;   \t3:27\n3. \t&quot;Louder Than Hell&quot;   \t\t2:32\n4. \t&quot;Keep Your Eye on the Money&quot;    4:40\n5. \t&quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;   \t \t3:59\n6. \t&quot;Tonight (We Need a Lover)&quot;    \t3:37\n7. \t&quot;Use It or Lose It&quot;   \t\t2:39\n8. \t&quot;Save Our Souls&quot;   \t\t4:13\n9. \t&quot;Raise Your Hands to Rock&quot;    \t2:48\n10. \t&quot;Fight for Your Rights&quot;    \t3:50\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0de6165a03550e051b997182212ec933d0ea3db","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-+1985+-+Theatre+Of+Pain+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0de6165a03550e051b997182212ec933d0ea3db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,222,97,101,160,53,80,224,81,185,151,24,34,18,236,147,61,14,163,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
