Eva, another schoolgirl, falls under the spell of Kathy's vengeful psyche, which is capable of horrible destruction using telekinesis and even killer snails to do her bidding. Soon the hallways at St. Mary's School are filled with screaming, and there's no way to escape.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlayback Guide For DVD/CD Player: This file can be played with any DIVX/MP4 compatible DVD/VCD Player.
