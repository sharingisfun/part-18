Shucks, it must be Christmas! This is a rip of the Classic Records 200g vinyl by a fella calls himself Dr. Robert. This is the much-coveted original mix. Sounds really good to me. But does it sounds better than the MFSL CD? Don't make me choose! Well, sounds a little cleaner than the MFSL CD, if you know what I mean. Less grungy. Compare versions of &quot;The Punk Meets the Godfather,&quot; and you'll see what I mean. This version features less bass and more top end, that's for sure. I think I prefer this mastering, though I may change my mind. Decide for yourself.\n\nThis is the 24-bit/96-kHz version for all you hot shots with expensive equipment and exceptional ears.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a718e08bc60478e8568f9b54a64bba314a4b276","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Quadrophenia+%281973%29+%5BVINYL%5D+%7B24-96%7D+%7BClassic+200g+Quie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a718e08bc60478e8568f9b54a64bba314a4b276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,113,142,8,188,96,71,142,133,104,249,181,74,100,187,163,20,164,178,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
