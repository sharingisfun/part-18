Eaglesmith's songs have an intimate relationship with force and fury, all carried through in the arrangement and delivery, providing a sense of menace to each tune. This is album noir from end to end. Great stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ed599b5c6fe27f69abad2ff2beee64a82034f0","amp;dn":"Fred+Eaglesmith+-+Lipstick+Lies+%26amp%3B+Gasoline+%5B1997%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Cc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ed599b5c6fe27f69abad2ff2beee64a82034f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,237,89,155,92,111,226,127,105,171,173,47,242,190,238,100,168,32,52,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
