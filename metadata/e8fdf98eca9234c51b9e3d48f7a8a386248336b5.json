Using some creative carpentry techniques, the new roof will look like it's been settling for two hundred fifty years. He'll also use salvaged chestnut to build the window frames, giving the house a more authentic feel. A trip to a foundry in Pennsylvania to pick out traditionally fashioned sconces and candle stands will help Daryl put the historically accurate finishing touches on the addition to his 1787 farmhouse. Daryl tries his own hand at striking iron.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8fdf98eca9234c51b9e3d48f7a8a386248336b5","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Daryl%27s.Restoration.Over-Hall.S01E03.720p.X264.SCREEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8fdf98eca9234c51b9e3d48f7a8a386248336b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,253,249,142,202,146,52,197,27,158,61,72,247,168,163,134,36,131,54,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
