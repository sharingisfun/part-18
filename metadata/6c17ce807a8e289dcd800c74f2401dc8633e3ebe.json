Sitar and tablas, ghatam and khanjira, mridangam and Carnatic violin blend seamlessly with muted trumpet and saxophones, screaming electric guitar and grooving electric bass lines, piano, upright bass and drums on this profound fusion of Indian classical and American jazz. \r\n\r\nRecorded in Mumbai and Madras, India and New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, the music on Milesâ€¦From India was performed by classical and jazz musicians from India with the addition of musicians who have recorded or performed with Miles Davis over the span of five decades.\r\n\r\nCD 1\r\n1.
