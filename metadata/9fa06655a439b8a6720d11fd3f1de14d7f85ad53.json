A four-track recorder allows you to record one track at a time while listening to the other 3 tracks. This allows you to record a guitar part, then add a vocal part, then add a harmony, and so on. The Beatles recorded several albums using only four tracks. Four-track cassette recorders were the first affordable multi-track recorders for home musicians. Multitrack recording software, like GarageBand and Pro Tools, allow you to record many tracks, but the principle is the same. FourTrack (the iPhone app) gives you the simplicity of the original cassette four-track and is more affordable. Plus itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always in your pocket, so you can record your musical ideas at the moment of inspiration.NEW IN THIS VERSIONNOTE: Please use WifiSync to download all your tracks before updating.
