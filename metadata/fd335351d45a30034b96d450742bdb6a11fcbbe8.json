And could this technology have helped the      \n         Third Reich build mysterious weapons and crafts far beyond    \n         the limits of 20th century science? During World War II,      \n         there were reports that the Germans built an operational      \n         flying saucer, known as the Hanebu, which was said to use     \n         mythical technology found in ancient Indian texts. Another    \n         craft was rumored to have been constructed with the help      \n         of psychics and mediums who claimed to have received          \n         detailed blueprints from extraterrestrial beings. Is          \n         it possible Hitler's quest for world domination was           \n         aided and abetted by ancient extraterrestrial technology      \n         that was rediscovered? And could the allegedly rebuilt        \n         alien devices developed in Germany have played a role in      \n          America's ability to land a man on the moon?                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
