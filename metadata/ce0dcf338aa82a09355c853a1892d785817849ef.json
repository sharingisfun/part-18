His musicality, his great sense of improvisation and his virtuosity, and unique, technical abilities with the guitar have earned him high (but discrete) praises from all around the world, including from many musicians he has played with.\n\nIn ceaseless permutation, guitarist Sylvain Luc and saxophonist Stefano Di Battistacroisent metals on the CD Giu La Testa. Ãƒâ€š  Consecration of a year and a half of concerts, music transforms the soundtracks of films. They see the output of the disc to the CafÃƒÂ© de la Danse on 23 October in the area Jazz festival. Why hell the two oldies chose to deploy the talents with music films of Nino Rota, Ennio Morricone or Michel Legrand? They spoke to me. Convergent responses. The guitarist responds to an urgent aspiration. So many images, memories, joy in my memory vibrate at these themes: it delayed to give them a new form of play with the past. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pecat.info/sylvain-luc-and-stefano-di-battista-sacred-coils/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pecat.info/sylvain-luc-and-stefano-di-battista-sacred-coils/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce0dcf338aa82a09355c853a1892d785817849ef","amp;dn":"Stefano+Di+Battista+%26amp%3B+Sylvain+Luc+-+Giu%27+la+testa+%5BJazz+MP3%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce0dcf338aa82a09355c853a1892d785817849ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,13,207,51,138,168,42,9,53,92,133,58,24,146,215,133,129,120,73,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
