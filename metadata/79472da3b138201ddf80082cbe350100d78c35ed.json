Rather than leave the 60+ GB of files that will never be used on my external to take up space (which I could use for comic books), I'm going to burn them off to blu-ray data discs and file them away in hopes that they may be used at some point in the future.\n\nNo big descriptions or explanations with these - you either know what they are, and that you want them, or you don't.\n\nThese uploads are definitely an experiment; if there is interest, I'll seed them for a while, but if there isn't, I'll have them deleted and &quot;file&quot; this stuff away. \t\t\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Swords &amp; Wizardry project builds and supports free-form roleplaying games. That is to say, games where Ã¢â‚¬Å“lightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rules create a framework instead of trying to cover every detail, every rule, and every situation. The Swords &amp; Wizardry game Ã¢â‚¬Å“clonesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the original rules of the fantasy roleplaying game that started it all back in 1974, when it was published by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. We also support two games we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write: OSRIC and Goblinoid GamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Labyrinth Lord. OSRIC is a clone of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1978 Ã¢â‚¬Å“First Edition,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Labyrinth Lord is a clone of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1981 Ã¢â‚¬Å“BasicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Edition. All these game rules are rewritten and reorganized to be easier to learn and play.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swordsandwizardry.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swordsandwizardry.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79472da3b138201ddf80082cbe350100d78c35ed","amp;dn":"Swords+and+Wizardry+Role+Playing+Dungeons+and+Dragons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79472da3b138201ddf80082cbe350100d78c35ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,71,45,163,177,56,32,29,223,128,8,44,190,53,1,0,215,140,53,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
