The project consists of Gorillaz music itself and an extensive fictional universe depicting a &quot;virtual band&quot; of cartoon characters. This band has four animated members: 2D (lead vocalist, keyboard, and melodica), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar and drum machine), Noodle (guitar, keyboard, and backing vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). Their fictional universe is explored through the band's website and music videos, as well as a number of other media, such as short cartoons. The music is a collaboration between various musicians, with Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor.\n\nThe band's 2001 debut album Gorillaz sold over seven million copies and earned them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band.[2] It was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2001, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request.[3] Their second studio album, Demon Days, released in 2005, went five times platinum in the UK,[4] double platinum in the United States,[5] earned five Grammy Award nominations for 2006[6] and won one of them in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category.[7] The band has won numerous other awards, including two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award, three MTV Europe Music Awards, and have been nominated for nine Brit Awards.[8][9] The combined sales of the Gorillaz and Demon Days albums had exceeded 15 million by 2007.[10] The band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, was released in March 2010. Their latest album, The Fall, was released in December 2010 as a free download for fan club members, then in April 2011 as a physical release. Their style is experimental and a composition of multiple musical genres, with a large number of influences including alternative, rock, hip hop, electronica, dub, reggae and pop. \n\n\n\nThe Singles Collection 2011\n\n\nThe Singles Collection: 2001Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2011 is a compilation album released by British virtual band Gorillaz on 28 November 2011. The album is a collection of the group's singles released between 2001 and 2011. The album is available in four different editions: standard, deluxe, 12&quot; vinyl and 7&quot; single box set.[12] The years 2001Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2011 in title of the compilation are somewhat misleading, seeing as &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; was first released in 2000 (albeit as an EP, the actual single itself was released in 2002), while the newest featuring track, &quot;Doncamatic&quot;, was released in 2010.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;  \n\n2.\t&quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; (featuring Del Tha Funkee Homosapien)\n\n3.\t&quot;19-2000&quot;  \n\n4.\t&quot;Rock the House&quot; (featuring Del Tha Funkee Homosapien)\n\n5.\t&quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot; (single edit) (featuring De La Soul)\n\n6.\t&quot;DARE&quot; (single edit) (featuring Shaun Ryder)\n\n7.\t&quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (single edit) (featuring Bootie Brown and San Fernandez Youth Chorus)\n\n8.\t&quot;Kids with Guns&quot; (featuring Neneh Cherry)\n\n9.\t&quot;El MaÃƒÂ±ana&quot;  \n\n10.\t&quot;Stylo&quot; (radio edit) (featuring Bobby Womack and Mos Def)\n\n11.\t&quot;Superfast Jellyfish&quot; (edit) (featuring De La Soul and Gruff Rhys)\n\n12.\t&quot;On Melancholy Hill&quot; (radio edit)\n\n13.\t&quot;Doncamatic&quot; (featuring Daley)\n\n14.\t&quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; (Ed Case/Sweetie Irie Refix) (edit)\n\n15.\t&quot;19-2000&quot; (Soulchild remix)\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04395428136b8d6eab1e4b2dfd89f07a96d5cf34","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+-+The+Singles+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2011+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04395428136b8d6eab1e4b2dfd89f07a96d5cf34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,57,84,40,19,107,141,110,171,30,75,45,253,137,240,122,150,213,207,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
