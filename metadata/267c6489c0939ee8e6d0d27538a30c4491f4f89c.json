After several failed attempts at fighting his own feelings, he ultimately succumbs to her. The two later escape to a far off, secluded village where they assume new identities as husband and wife and begin running a children's school. After several months of relative happiness, the couple's identity is discovered by a local priest. Under moralistic pressure from both Camila's family and the Catholic church the authorities apprehend the lovers, and imprison them for sacrilege. from IMDb\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nVÃƒÂ­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÂ­deo Bitrate: 808.083 Kbps\nÃƒï¿½udio Codec: MPEG1/2 L3\nÃƒï¿½udio Bitrate: 123.408 kbps 48 KHz\nAspect Ratio: 1.478 (544 x 368)\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\n\nSubs: English, Spanish and Portuguese\n\nNot my rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:267c6489c0939ee8e6d0d27538a30c4491f4f89c","amp;dn":"Camila+%28Mar%26iacute%3Ba+Luisa+Bemberg%2C+1984%29+Subs+Eng+Spa+Pt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"267c6489c0939ee8e6d0d27538a30c4491f4f89c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,124,100,137,192,147,158,232,230,208,210,117,56,163,12,68,145,244,248,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
