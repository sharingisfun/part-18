His experiences both in the field and in training showcase the latest methods and technologies available and this fully illustrated book reveals many of the secrets of his trade. Counter-insurgency is fast becoming one of the most important aspects of police and military work around the world, with forces often deployed at short notice to fight against an ill-defined enemy. With this in mind, Leroy Thompson describes the techniques best employed in a variety of situations, all illustrated with pictures and explained with examples of their use. He stresses that the primary concern in every situation ought to be a 'Hearts and Minds' style operation comprising an attempt to achieve objectives without the use of force - it is only after all such possibilities have failed that the use of force should be considered, and then only by highly trained special forces operatives. The very political nature of counter-insurgency operations means that operatives are often working under extremely tense and delicate circumstances. The operations are often extremely violent and short-lived, but Thompson emphasizes that they must be part of a wider political, social or economic goal and solution for success to be achieved. This book has a wider significance for anyone with an interest in world security.\n\n\n# Publisher \tGreenhill Books; First edition (February 19, 2006)\n# Language \tEnglish\n# ISBN-10 \t1853675024\n# ASIN \tB008SLKONQ\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Counter-Insurgency-Manual-Leroy-Thompson/dp/B008SLKONQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372399481&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=leroy+thompson+counter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Counter-Insurgency-Manual-Leroy-Thompson/dp/B008SLKONQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372399481&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=leroy+thompson+counter&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e6bd36f0938133d6b6fe42fb5ad0ab7992412c8","amp;dn":"The+Counter-Insurgency+Manual++%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e6bd36f0938133d6b6fe42fb5ad0ab7992412c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,107,211,111,9,56,19,61,107,111,228,47,181,173,10,183,153,36,18,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
