The band, formed by Don Wilson and Bob Bogle, two masonry workers, has had an enduring impact on the development of music worldwide, having sold over 100 million records, and are to date the best-selling instrumental band of all time. In 2008, the Ventures were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their music has been cited by many famed guitarists as an influence; indeed, their virtuosity, experimentation with guitar effects, and unique sound laid the groundwork for innumerable groups, earning them the moniker &quot;The Band that Launched a Thousand Bands&quot;. They have also contributed to the surf music genre, though they are not, as popularly perceived, strictly a surf band. Though their popularity in the United States waned in the 1970s, the group remains revered in Japan, where they still tour regularly to this day. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a65f44740adac397eb65cc1eaaf8c4d31ad75877","amp;dn":"The+Ventures-4+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a65f44740adac397eb65cc1eaaf8c4d31ad75877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,95,68,116,10,218,195,151,235,101,204,30,170,248,196,211,26,215,88,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
