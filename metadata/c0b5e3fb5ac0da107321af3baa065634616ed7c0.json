They were originally established with American rock band Elf's members, though over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. In addition to lead singers Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet, Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White, the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neo-classical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group.[1]\n\nRainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.[2] The band has sold over 28 million albums worldwide and 4 million albums in the United States.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0b5e3fb5ac0da107321af3baa065634616ed7c0","amp;dn":"Rainbow+studio+discography+1975-1983+vinyl+24-192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0b5e3fb5ac0da107321af3baa065634616ed7c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,181,227,251,90,192,218,16,115,33,175,59,170,6,86,52,97,110,215,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
