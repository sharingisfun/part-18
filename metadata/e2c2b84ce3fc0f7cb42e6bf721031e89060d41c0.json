Now she must attend the uber exclusive academy, where admission depends on pedigree, namely, ancestry from Zeus, Hera, and other Greek gods. That's right, they're real, not myth, and their teen descendants are like the classical heroes: supersmart and super beautiful with a few superpowers. And now they're on her track team! Armed only with her Nikes and the will to win, Phoebe races to find her place among the gods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2c2b84ce3fc0f7cb42e6bf721031e89060d41c0","amp;dn":"Oh+My+Gods+-+Tera+Lynn+Childs.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2c2b84ce3fc0f7cb42e6bf721031e89060d41c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,194,184,76,227,252,15,124,180,46,107,247,33,3,30,137,6,13,65,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
