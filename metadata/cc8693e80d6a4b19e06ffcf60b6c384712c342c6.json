And it is the second release to be distributed under their new partnership with Integrity, following last fall?s release of Nothing Is Impossible. Heal Our Land is also the first Planetshakers project to be distributed in the U.S. by Integrity?s mainstream distribution partner, Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nOriginally formed to lead worship for the first Planetshakers conference held in Australia, the Planetshakers band is passionate about uniting generations worldwide through worship. Their goal is to see people encounter God, be transformed by His presence and empowered to make a difference in their world. And though they tour internationally, the team remains based out of Planetshakers City Church, a multi-campus, 7,800-member congregation in Melbourne that is pastored by husband and wife, Russell and Sam Evans.\n\nRecorded live at last year?s Planetshakers Conference, Heal Our Land offers up new songs of passionate, vertical praise and sung prayers including the anthemic title track based on 2 Chronicles 7:14. The project features Planetshakers team members including Sam Evans, Rudy Nikkerud and Joth Hunt, who also produced the album.\n\n\n\n\nTrack list:\n1. Supernatural\n2. Good To Me\n3. Do It Again*\n4. Nothing Is Impossible (featuring Israel Houghton)\n5. Heal Our Land\n6. Strength Of My Life\n7.
