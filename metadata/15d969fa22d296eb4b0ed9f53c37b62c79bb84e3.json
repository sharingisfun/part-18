With band still riding high after the '56 Newport triumph and fresh off the road from Europe, they recorded a jukebox full of 45 single-sized tracks that bear riveting performances by several classic Ellingtonians including Jimmy Hamilton, Ray Nance, Clark Terry, Britt Woodman, Harry Carney, and Billy Strayhorn playing piano on two cuts. And then there's Johnny Hodges. Hodges caresses and finesses his way through ballads, reinventing the language of heartache. His instantly recognizable voice playfully darts in and out of up-tempo arrangements, always sweeping sweetly up a scale, always drenched in blues.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 &quot;Three J's Blues&quot; - 2:54\n2 &quot;Smada&quot; - 2:38\n3 &quot;Pie Eye's Blues&quot; - 3:27\n4 &quot;Sweet and Pungent&quot; - 4:03\n5 &quot;C Jam Blues&quot; - 4:52\n6 &quot;In a Mellow Tone&quot; - 2:43\n7 &quot;Blues in Blueprint&quot; - 3:43\n8 &quot;The Swingers Get the Blues, Too&quot; - 3:09\n9 &quot;The Swinger's Jump&quot; - 3:53\n10 &quot;Blues in Orbit&quot; - 2:29\n11 &quot;Villes Ville Is the Place, Man&quot; - 2:33\n12 &quot;Track 360&quot; - 2:03 \n13 &quot;Sentimental Lady&quot; - 4:02 \n14 &quot;Brown Penny&quot; - 3:02 \n15 &quot;Pie Eye's Blues&quot; [alternate take] - 3:32 \n16 &quot;Sweet and Pungent&quot; [alternate take] - 3:52 \n17 &quot;The Swinger's Jump&quot; [alternate take] - 3:51 \n18 &quot;Blues in Orbit&quot; [alternate take] - 2:39 \n19 &quot;Track 360&quot; [alternate take] - 2:01 \n\nRecorded at Radio Recorders, Los Angeles on February 4, 1958 (tracks 12 &amp; 19) and February 12, 1958 (tracks 10 &amp; 18 ) and at Columbia 30th Street Studio, New York on February 25, 1959 (track 11), December 2, 1959 (tracks 1, 3-5 &amp; 13-16) and December 3, 1959 (tracks 2, 6-9 &amp; 17).\n\nTracks 12-19: Bonus tracks on CD reissue\n\nPersonnel\n\nDuke Ellington ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano (tracks 1, 3-6 &amp; 8-19)\nBilly Strayhorn - piano (tracks 2 &amp; 7)\nRay Nance - trumpet\nCat Anderson, Shorty Baker, Clark Terry - trumpet (tracks 10-12, 18 &amp; 19)\nFats Ford - trumpet (track 11)\nBritt Woodman - trombone\nMatthew Gee, Booty Wood - trombone (tracks 1-9 &amp; 13-17)\nQuentin Jackson - trombone (tracks 10-12, 18 &amp; 19)\nJohn Sanders - valve trombone (tracks 10-12, 18 &amp; 19)\nJimmy Hamilton - clarinet, tenor saxophone\nJohnny Hodges - alto saxophone (tracks 1-9, 11 &amp; 13-17)\nRussell Procope - alto saxophone, clarinet\nPaul Gonsalves - tenor saxophone\nHarry Carney - baritone saxophone\nJimmy Woode - bass\nJimmy Johnson - drums (tracks 1-9 &amp; 13-17)\nSam Woodyard - drums (tracks 10-12, 18 &amp; 19)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d969fa22d296eb4b0ed9f53c37b62c79bb84e3","amp;dn":"Duke+Ellington+Blues+in+Orbit%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d969fa22d296eb4b0ed9f53c37b62c79bb84e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,217,105,250,34,210,150,235,75,14,217,245,60,55,182,44,121,187,132,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
