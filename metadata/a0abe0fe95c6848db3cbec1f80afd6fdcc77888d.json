He joins a doctor who has fortified himself in a clinic and helps him defend against the constant attacks of a hostile barbarian. This movie has few characters and no spoken dialogue! Besson's first feature-length film is definitely one of his best.\n\n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks? Cool! Do &quot;symbolic metaphors&quot; give you a \ntingle?
