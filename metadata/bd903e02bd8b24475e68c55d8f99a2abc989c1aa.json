The band&amp;#039;s ninth studio album - Scare Yourself - was released May 23, 2005. \n\nWhen the group made their international breakthrough in 1989, they had to change the band name to D.A.D. to avoid an impending lawsuit from the Walt Disney Company. In 1995, the &quot;spelling&quot; changed to D:A:D, to make it more obvious that it was an abbreviation. Finally in 2000, the band story became one of advanced punctuation as the spelling was changed to the more internet-friendly D-A-D.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.d-a-d.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.d-a-d.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd903e02bd8b24475e68c55d8f99a2abc989c1aa","amp;dn":"D.A.D.+-+Call+Of+The+Wild","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd903e02bd8b24475e68c55d8f99a2abc989c1aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,144,62,2,189,139,36,71,94,104,197,93,143,153,162,171,201,137,193,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
