More specifically so, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“LandrechtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“law of the landÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), laws of inheritance, marriage etc.\nHermann Gauch was a close friend to Walther DarrÃƒÂ©, and despite these men both being part of the Nationalsocialist German administration; their vision of the future Germany perhaps was not so much in line with the one of their party comrades.\nHermann Gauch Ã¢â‚¬Å“embarassedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the NSDAP by advocating a complete de-Christianization of all the Germanic territories, and the reintroduction of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blut und BodenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Blood and Soil) based Germanic pagan culture and religion; basically built on a reconstruction of the ancient Germanic culture.\nAlong with Walther DarrÃƒÂ©, he also sought to reform the calendar, to a Germanic/rural based one. He was also behind the creation of Germanic Pagan memorial monuments, among them the Sachsenhain monument in Verden, paying tribute to the 4500 Saxon nobles who were executed by Ã¢â‚¬Å“Karl the GreatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (who Gauch tried to have officially renamed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Karl the SlaughtererÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), as they according to Germanic law arrived to negotiations unarmed.\n\nTo those of you whimpering about Nazism and whatever, I can tell you that Gauch was found not guilty to any war crimes during WWII, and died in 1978.\nFor Germanic Heathens, this is an important document. Because you can go on and on about pagan gods, magic, blots, rune yoga and archaeological matters all you want until you virtually drop dead. But if there's no basis in this real world, it will never gain any foothold outside a close circle of curious people.\nThis book on the contrary, tells us something upon which a real Germanic/Pagan society can be built. Furthermore, to the disappointment of some, it contains no schemes of death camps or other atrocities. Just plain rural Germanic lifestyle. It's not my fault that Nazis wrote the Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by far Ã¢â‚¬â€œ best books on these topics. They just did.\n\n---\n\nInformation:\nFormat: PDF\nSize: 2 168 KB\nPrint length: 80 pages\nLanguage: German\nPublished year: 1934 (this unedited facsimile edition was published in 1985)\nPublisher: Blut und Boden Verlag (Faksimile-Verlag/Versand)\n\nShare and seed until RagnarÃƒÂ¶k!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cb0b6803c099942f9428e24dfb7c5aa3b7aafee","amp;dn":"Die+Germanische+Odal+oder+Allod+Verfassung+-+Hermann+Gauch+%5BDerH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cb0b6803c099942f9428e24dfb7c5aa3b7aafee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,176,182,128,60,9,153,66,249,66,142,36,223,183,197,170,59,122,175,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
