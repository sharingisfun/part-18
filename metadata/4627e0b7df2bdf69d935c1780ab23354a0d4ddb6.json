Club director Will Schuester personally buys a meager section of advertising space in the book so that a photograph featuring at least two members can be included. Fearing unpopularity, the club nominate Rachel to represent them in the photograph. Rachel convinces Finn (Cory Monteith) to appear alongside her, but after being teased by his peers, he drops out. When it transpires that the school photographer (John Ross Bowie) is soon to direct a commercial for his brother-in-law, a local mattress store owner, Rachel convinces him to cast the glee club in it, believing that local celebrity status will prevent the other students from mocking them.\n\nWill is dismayed to learn that his close friend Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), the school guidance counsellor, has arranged to marry her fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), on the same day the glee club will compete at sectionals. Will goes on to discover that his wife Terri has been lying to him for months about her supposed pregnancy. She actually experienced a hysterical pregnancy and hid the truth from him by wearing a pregnancy pad under her clothes, while planning to secretly adopt glee club member Quinn Fabray's (Dianna Agron) baby. Will walks out on her and spends the night at the school, sleeping on one of the mattresses given to the glee club in payment for their commercial.\n\nSue informs Will that the club receiving payment for the commercial revokes their amateur status, and thus their eligibility to compete at sectionals. Quinn, who has been trying to convince Sue to let her appear in the cheerleaders' photographs despite being removed from the team due to her pregnancy, reminds Sue that as their coach she has often given the cheerleaders perks which would also render them ineligible for competition. She demands that Sue sacrifice one of the cheerleaders' six pages in the yearbook to the glee club. Sue agrees, and accepts Quinn back onto the cheerleading team, but Quinn tells her she no longer wishes to be a cheerleader. Will announces that he will not be accompanying the club to sectionals, as he was the one who accepted payment, and as such they will only be allowed to compete without his involvement. The episode ends with the glee club having a group photograph taken for the yearbook, which is subsequently defaced by their schoolmates.\n\nI Will Be Uploading All Glee Episodes As Single Files Then All Together (:\nI Will Also Be Uploading All Albums To Each Season (:\n\nEnjoy (: &amp; Please Seed \n\nThanks\n\n- [Np]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4627e0b7df2bdf69d935c1780ab23354a0d4ddb6","amp;dn":"Glee+-+S01E12+-+Mattress+%5BNp%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4627e0b7df2bdf69d935c1780ab23354a0d4ddb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,39,224,183,223,43,223,105,217,53,193,120,10,178,51,84,160,212,221,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
