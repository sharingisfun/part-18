A superb work of art.\n\n(2)I cannot be as eloquant as the other reviewers below but Karnamrita's music is a magical gem to be discovered.\nThis is world music, not 'new age', soulfully inspired by her tenure in India.\nHer vocal training is up there with other vocal greats like Lisa Girrard (of Dead Can Dance fame).\n\n(3)One of the few selection of songs that seems to breathe harmony and love in your surroundings each time they are played.\nNeedless to say, they are a favourite addition to my religious music collection.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a00ea29bee90a8fe90ff293613b18d595b7532","amp;dn":"%28Bhajan%29+Karnamrita+Dasi+-+Dasi+%28Prayers+for+Women%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1a00ea29bee90a8fe90ff293613b18d595b7532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,160,14,162,155,238,144,168,254,144,255,41,54,19,177,141,89,91,117,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
