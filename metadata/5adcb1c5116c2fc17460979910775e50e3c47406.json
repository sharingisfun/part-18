He trusted the Tsar of Russia - but the Tsar reneged on their deal. He sought revenge by invading Russia in 1812 - but the campaign was a disaster. He sought to defend France against her enemies - but made some grave and ultimately suicidal military misjudgements.\n\nEver since the revolution had taken place in France in 1789, the monarchist nations of the world were out to destroy Napoleon. At the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, they were granted their ultimate opportunity.\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/Cztr9uW6ZX.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/JE4ApTBNzW.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5adcb1c5116c2fc17460979910775e50e3c47406","amp;dn":"Napoleon.2015.s01e03.ENG.SUBS.WEBRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5adcb1c5116c2fc17460979910775e50e3c47406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,220,177,197,17,108,47,193,116,96,151,153,16,119,94,80,227,196,116,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
