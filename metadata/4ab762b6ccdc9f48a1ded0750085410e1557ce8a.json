In all other regions, it was obtainable from the e-shop only.\r\n\r\nThis is the japanese version of the 3DS game, and it is only in japanese language..\r\n\r\nIt is a &quot;cross-buy&quot; game, meaning that if you purchased it for the 3DS, nintendo would let you download the Wii-U version for free.. Likewise, if you purchased the Wii-U version, nintendo would let you download the 3DS version for free..\r\n\r\nIt is a &quot;cross-play&quot; game, meaning that you can play it on one device (Wii-U or 3DS) and some how it will synchronize your saved data between the two devices so that you can switch back and forth if you want to..\r\n\r\nThe Wii-U version is not included in this download, and have no idea where you would find that image at.. (I think the Wii-U was recently finally hacked in mid-2015, but only if you have an older firmware version)..\r\n\r\nThis is a single .3ds file inside of a .7z archive file..\r\n\r\nYou need a gateway card or maybe some type of CFW to get this to work.. And you need a 3DS with lower version sysnand firmware..\r\n\r\nI have confirmed it to work at least with this set up:\r\nnew-3DS\r\nsysnand: 9.2.0\r\nemunand: 9.2.0\r\ngateway launcher software version 3.4.1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab762b6ccdc9f48a1ded0750085410e1557ce8a","amp;dn":"%5B3DS%5D+Mario+vs+Donkey+Kong%3A+Minna+de+Mini+Land+%5BJPN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab762b6ccdc9f48a1ded0750085410e1557ce8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,183,98,182,204,220,159,72,161,222,208,117,0,133,65,14,21,87,206,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
