Achy ballads such as \\&quot;Fall Away\\&quot; are too long on airbrushed\nprettiness, but between the band\\'s sculpted guitars and meatier cuts such\nas the lead single, \\&quot;Over My Head (Cable Car),\\&quot; How to Save a Life offers\nmore elegantly wasted twentysomething angst than the average O.C.\nsoundtrack.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ed272921767d62560af110e3c0d6e1621f73796","amp;dn":"The_Fray-How_To_Save_A_Life-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ed272921767d62560af110e3c0d6e1621f73796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,210,114,146,23,103,214,37,96,175,17,14,60,13,110,22,33,247,55,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
