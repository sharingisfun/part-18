I don't think that the site managers should continue to make money from the name and the knowledge of Greg Plitt!\r\n\r\nSadly during the making and starting the seeding of this torrent I lost the whole folder with all the files. I was able to recover some of them, but some got broken. Why ? - Every file is made by manually downloading and joining each of download *.ts file parts(~2MBs each). During the recovery process some of the files got replaced by the pieces which were part of other files.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Please note that the files having the %_fixed% in their file names are BROKEN!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213e030051693bf8a7848e7c2a588d6e5e54cce2","amp;dn":"Greg+Plitt+SiteRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213e030051693bf8a7848e7c2a588d6e5e54cce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,62,3,0,81,105,59,248,167,132,142,124,42,88,141,110,94,84,204,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
