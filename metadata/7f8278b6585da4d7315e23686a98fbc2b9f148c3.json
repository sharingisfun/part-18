PROTECTION: Securom: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: RPG\n\nProper notes:\n\nThe SKIDROW release uses a loader, which is not allowed by any scene rule\nan issue that was already covered in an earlier nfo\n\nSKIDROW, pressured by this, decided to argue by spreading irrelevant\nspeculative, and unfactual information about our work. We didn't know whether\nto laugh or to cry at this latest round of misinformation. One thing that\nmakes us smile, is that the more they try to explain, the more they reveal\nthemselves to understand little or nothing about Securom, or indeed any of\nthe other copy protections mentioned. It also reveals that while they have\npermission to use an old group name, and are using the word 'scene' a lot\nthey are quite new to it, and understand little of what it is about\n\nFor those who have not read the propaganda, here is a short summary of the\nmain points. According to SKIDROW:\nRELOADED cracks are bad, because SKIDROW does not understand how they work\nSKIDROW cracks are good, because they do not know how to do it any better\nEnd users, who are not contributing anything to the scene, do not\nunderstand any of this anyhow, and do not care if they use good cracks or\nbad ones\nConclusion: we're allowed to do whatever the hell we want, including bad\ncracks\n\nTo SKIDROW:\n\nAs you say we are not living in the year 2000 anymore. But there are at least\nthree groups who are able to crack Securom in a proper way. Just because it\nis too hard for you does not make it acceptable to ignore rules, and start\nusing loaders for this protection\n\nWe are not really sure why you would go off-topic and bring in examples of\nall other copy protections in your nfo. Well actually, we do: you're hoping\nthat people will get distracted and buy it. But it does leave you with a\nbunch of claims that you are not able to prove technically\nEspecially when you start talking about copy protections such as Solidshield\nfor which you have never demonstrated any ability to crack. The issue that\nwe were talking about is Securom. Basically everything you say in your nfo\nis a complete fabrication, it is without proof, and although we should not\nhave to defend ourselves against mud slingers such as yourselves, we will\naddress some of the lies below\n\nFirst of all we will say something about our Solidshield cracks, because it is\nobvious that you do not understand how Solidshield works at all. If you had\never cracked any Solidshield game instead of using unprotected exes, you\nwould know that dvm.dll contains tables with VMed functions for all protected\nmodules\nThat is also why these DVM files are so big (~100MB). In our cracked\nreleases, the replacement dll is ~100KB. Perhaps you think we stumbled upon\nsome fantasy land, overflowing with unprotected russian files, rode a\nunicorn, did some magic, and packed encrypted VM tables from 100MB to 100KB\nIf you would debug it you would see that our dll only decrypts modules in\nthe same way as Solidshield does and it redirects stolen functions to\ncompletely rebuild functions, but you appear incapable of even doing that on\nyour own\nIn the cases of Risen and Riddick you claim we did 'activation', but both\ncracks are complete rebuilds. In fact Risen does not even have activation\nbut a TAGES DVD-Check. There is not even any activation method present, so\nhow could we activate something without activation? Magic &amp; unicorns again?\nWe'll chalk up this lie to a mistake, as it is also besides the point if we\ndid activation keygens for SS1 and SS2\nKeygens were always allowed and are often times the best solution, as they\nbreak the copy protection on its own premise, by actually activating the\nproduct. Many times they even work for updates, which is great, unless your\nmain concern with updates is to patch every one for points. But if you are\nseriously arguing against activation keygens, you are also arguing against\nregular keygens, and indeed serials. So, better get patching, eh?\n\nAbout our steam emu. We are not sure what exactly the emu ofdoes\nbut we do understand that you have spent a fair amount of time perusing that\nparticular forum community, and to put it mildly, learning from their\nexperiences. The claim sure does seem like a big case of &quot;takes one to know\none&quot;, but last time we checked TASM could not compile C++ files\n\nNow we can finally go back to the real issue, Securom. You make a lot of\nbold statements and strange comments in your nfo:\n1) Our method is &quot;cheesy&quot;? Come on. We seriously doubt that you even\nunderstand our cracks, but since we are cool guys, we will provide a brief\ndescription of how we make them, so that perhaps you may at last understand\nWe:\nremove all pieces of x86 code that makes the game dependent on Securom\nsection(s)\nremove all references to relocated code that exists in isolated memory\nblocks\ndecompile (look up the word in a computer science dictionary) all VM\nprograms and rebuild the original x86 code\n2) You speak of 'vm triggers'. What is a VM trigger? Could it be a simple VM\ncall? Could it be that you are calling the SMS module a VM trigger?\nEither way, in our cracks we rebuild all VM functions, including a few custom\nfunctions that only appear in certain games\nSMS, DFE and DFA systems are obviously emulated because the games heavily\nrely on it. Unless you completely rewrite parts of the game code there is\nno way to remove it. If you have problems understanding this concept, just\nthink of your steam cracks that are still filled with original code\n(integrity checks, system checks, etc)\nHow can you possibly say we emulate the exact same way as you do? Only\npeople who have no clue about Securom would make such ludicrous claims\n\nIn conclusion, SKIDROW has proven that they do no care about the scene or\nits rules. To them, the scene is not about sharing with people who\ncontribute, but about becoming the darling of leechers by breaking rules and\nslandering the competition. As a means to an end, it is apparently their\nstrategy to provide no evidence for claims that are at best misleading, but\nmost of the time just direct and factual lies\n\nTo everybody else: Have a happy new year !\n\n1.
