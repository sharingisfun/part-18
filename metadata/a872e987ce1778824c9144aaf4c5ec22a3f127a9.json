It's proven to be an excellent way to spotlight the band's affinity for intricate synths and dance rhythms. In 2008, Health released Disco, a remix album of their self-titled debut; its successor, Disco2, is a remix album of 2009's Get Color. Disco2 features remixes from Gold Panda, Crystal Castles, Javelin, CFCF and others, plus new track &quot;USA Boys,&quot; a spacey, fidgety number that's right at home among the remixes.\n\nTrack\n01 USA Boys\n02 Before Tigers (CFCF Remix)\n03 In Heat (Javelin Remix)\n04 Die Slow (Tobacco Remix)\n05 Severin (Small Black Remix)\n06 Before Tigers (Gold Panda Remix)\n07 Eat Flesh (Crystal Castles Remix)\n08 In Violet (Salem Remix)\n09 Nice Girls (Blondes Remix)\n10 Die Slow (Pictureplane Remix)\n11 Nice Girls (Little Loud Remix)\n12 Before Tigers (Blindoldfreak Remix)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a872e987ce1778824c9144aaf4c5ec22a3f127a9","amp;dn":"Health+-+Disco2+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a872e987ce1778824c9144aaf4c5ec22a3f127a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,114,233,135,206,23,120,130,76,145,68,170,244,197,236,34,163,241,39,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
