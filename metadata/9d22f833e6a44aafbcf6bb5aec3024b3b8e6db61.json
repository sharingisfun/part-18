He has annotated these games in detail from a modern perspective, explaining the useful lessons that can be learnt from them, while avoiding the harmful dogma that characterized many older works of this type. Topics include: Attacking the King, Defence, Piece Power, and Endgame Themes. Each game is followed by a recap of the main lessons to be learned.\n\nGiddins writes in a highly accessible down-to-earth style that appeals to club players seeking to improve their understanding of practical chess. His knowledge of Russian-language chess literature has enabled him to find many excellent examples that have not appeared in previous western literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d22f833e6a44aafbcf6bb5aec3024b3b8e6db61","amp;dn":"50+Essential+Chess+Lessons+%28Steve+Giddins%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d22f833e6a44aafbcf6bb5aec3024b3b8e6db61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,34,248,51,230,164,74,175,188,246,187,90,236,48,36,179,184,230,219,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
