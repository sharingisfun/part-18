And it appears that number is increasing each year. Diabetes is particularly difficult for women in large part due to the hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle, changes that affect blood sugar levels. As a consequence women with diabetes have higher rates of cheat pain, heart attack, coronary heart disease and stroke. And women with diabetes face special challenges.\n\nThe Smart WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to Diabetes provides advice, tips, and research from a diverse community of women living with diabetes. It provides practical insight and references for the optimal management of diabetes from women living with the disease as well as doctors, nurses, nutritionists, and educators. The personal anecdotes throughout the book reveal the good and the bad of living with diabetes, including the frustration, sense of shame, sense of isolation as well as the capacity for strength and the opportunity for growth.\n\nThe Smart WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to Diabetes lets you know that you are not alone but rather will make you feel like you are sitting in your favorite coffee shop with your friends who share the same disease.\n\n\n# Paperback: 198 pages\n# Publisher: Demos Health; 1 edition (August 16, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1936303132\n# ISBN-13: 978-1936303137","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:485135e83eec9c7847348c51e21705b6fbb8ca58","amp;dn":"The+Smart+Woman%5C%27s+Guide+to+Diabetes+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"485135e83eec9c7847348c51e21705b6fbb8ca58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,81,53,232,62,236,156,120,71,52,140,81,226,23,5,182,251,184,202,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
