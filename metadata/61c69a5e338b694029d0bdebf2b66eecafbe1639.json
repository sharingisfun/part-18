Recorded at concerts in 1969 and 1970, this was an era in which Morrison was becoming increasingly dissolute, and increasingly disinterested in the whole rock machine. During much of this set, he seems not to be taking himself or the songs too seriously, tossing flippant asides to the audience that seem to treat the whole exercise as a charade. As for the music, the haunting &quot;Universal Mind&quot; and the basic blues-rocker &quot;Build Me a Woman&quot; are originals that are not found on their proper albums; &quot;Close to You&quot; is a dull Muddy Waters cover sung by Ray Manzarek; &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; is a fair cover of the Bo Diddley standard; and the controversial &quot;The Celebration of the Lizard&quot; is a drawn-out opus that is as much  poetry recitation as music. There are also extended versions of &quot;Soul Kitchen,&quot;  &quot;Break On Through,&quot; and &quot;When the Music's Over&quot; that flag considerably in comparison  to the sleeker studio versions. \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.House announcer [02:40] \n 02.Who do you love [06:03] \n 03.Alabama song [01:51] \n 04.Backdoor man [02:22] \n 05.Love hides [01:49] \n 06.Five to one [04:34] \n 07.Build me A woman [03:34] \n 08.When the music's over [16:16] \n 09.Close to you [04:05] \n 10.Universal mind [04:55] \n 11.Petition the lord with [00:53] \n prayer \n 12.Dead cats, dead rats [01:58] \n 13.Break on through #2 [04:37] \n 14.Lions in the street [01:14] \n 15.Wake up [01:21] \n 16.A little game [01:13] \n 17.The hill dwellers [02:36] \n 18.Not to touch the earth [04:14] \n 19.Names of the kingdom [01:29] \n 20.The palace of exile [02:21] \n 21.Soul kitchen [07:15] \n ____ \n \n 77:20 min \n 109,0 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61c69a5e338b694029d0bdebf2b66eecafbe1639","amp;dn":"The_Doors-Absolutely_Live-%28Retail%29-1970-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61c69a5e338b694029d0bdebf2b66eecafbe1639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,198,154,94,51,139,105,64,41,208,189,235,242,182,110,236,175,190,22,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
