Clavicles (2:55)\n\nWith the folk genre being continuously divided into increasingly specific subgenres, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a breath of fresh air for a band like I Am Oak to show up out of the blue (read: Europe) with some engaging, first-rate classic sound . On their first album, On Claws, the Dutch band, headed by Thijs Kuijken and supported by various others in live performances, does everything that a good folk band should; the album swings from mood to mood with little warning, from brooding sorrow to frolicking apathy, to endearing honesty and back again, all the while maintaining a unified, mellow quality through gentle, hummable melodies and understated guitar and banjo. It might take a couple of thorough listens to get hooked, but once you realize the delicate power contained in songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHearthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStorm,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to not want to follow Thijs Kuijken and friends on the rest of what hopefully will be a long and successful career.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:def34a9b6e6410d28ecc40cd93a1177f9a74ee03","amp;dn":"I+Am+Oak...On+Claws%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"def34a9b6e6410d28ecc40cd93a1177f9a74ee03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,243,74,155,110,100,16,210,142,204,64,205,147,161,23,127,154,116,238,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
