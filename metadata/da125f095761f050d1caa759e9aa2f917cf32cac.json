The title, Hello Cruel World, is a pun on the famed exit line - a joke that, like the lovely melodies and deliciously textured arrangements framing these 11 songs - sweetens this captivating music spun from a year of turmoil. Peters calls Hello Cruel World her &quot;most close-to-the-bone work, written at a time when I felt absolutely fearless about telling the truth.&quot; Peters and her guest Rodney Crowell sing, &quot;life is still a beautiful disaster,&quot; on &quot;Dark Angel.&quot; But Peters keeps the accent on the &quot;beautiful&quot; throughout her ninth disc, with both her poetic language and the spare, evocative sounds she created in the studio to support her organic story-telling. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[img]http://dickthespic.org/2012/01/12/gretchen-peters/[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da125f095761f050d1caa759e9aa2f917cf32cac","amp;dn":"Gretchen+Peters...Hello+Cruel+World%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da125f095761f050d1caa759e9aa2f917cf32cac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,18,95,9,87,97,240,80,209,202,167,89,233,170,47,145,124,243,44,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
