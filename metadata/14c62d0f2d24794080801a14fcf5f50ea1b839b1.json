The grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ranch has been left to John GradyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, a small-time actress who has no interest in it and will sell it. John GradyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, psychologically damaged by World War II and now physically ill as well, tells his son goodbye. With no apparent future in Texas, and sensing the threat of the new era to the traditional life he values, John Grady urges his old friend Rawlins to accompany him to Mexico. There, John Grady will find that his innocence, or ignorance, will ultimately lead him close to destruction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c62d0f2d24794080801a14fcf5f50ea1b839b1","amp;dn":"Cormac+McCarthy-All+the+Pretty+Horses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c62d0f2d24794080801a14fcf5f50ea1b839b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,198,45,15,45,36,121,64,128,128,26,20,252,245,245,14,161,184,57,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
