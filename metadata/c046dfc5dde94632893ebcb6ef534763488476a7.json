Formed in 1957, the SI was active in Europe through the 1960s and aspired to major social and political transformations.\n\nRene Vienet is one of the only French Sinologists to have denounced the Chinese totalitarian regime and its nihilistic Cultural Revolution, at a time when, on the Right and Left, many looked favorably upon Mao Tse-Tung. Over the course of five broadcasts, A voix nue looks at this uncommon person.\n\nRene Vienet was norn in the Havre, where his father was a dock worker. While a student, he seduced a Girl Scout who was the sister of the companion of Guy Debord; when he showed up in Paris to study Chinese with Jacques Pimpaneau, he joined the Situationist International. Studying in China, he saw the beginnings of the &quot;revo-cul&quot; (the term is his). He was expelled from China in 1966, and without difficulty he was among the first in France to denounce the &quot;Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.&quot;\n\n*******************************\n\nOriginal Title: La dialectique peut-elle casser des briques?\nReleased: 1973 \nEng. Title: Can Dialectics Break Bricks?\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069970/\nVideo: DivX 5.0, 352ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½240, 29.97 fps\nAudio: MP3 128k 44.1kHz\nLength: 01h 22m 19s\nSize: 480.96MB\nLanguage: FranÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ais\nSubtitles: English (onscreen)\nAbout: The film uses a much older martial arts film (&quot;The Crush&quot; from Doo Kwang Gee) for its visuals which has been dubbed over by the filmmakers in an attempt at detournement. The concept and motivation of this film was to adapt a bourgeois film into a radical critique of cultural hegemony and thus into tools of subversive revolutionary ideals. The Narrative is based upon a conflict between the proletarian and bureaucrats within state capitalism. The proletarians enlist their dialectics and radical subjectivity to fight their oppressors whilst the bureaucrats defend themselves using a combination of bribery and violence. The film is noted for its humorous approach to this serious subject matter. The film also contains many references to revolutionaries who thought and fought for the realisation of a post-capitalist world, including Marx, Bakunin, and Wilhelm Reich. Also Subplots dealing with issues of gender equality, alienation, trade unionism, May 1968, and the Situationist themselves are riddled throughout the film. The conclusions reached by the filmmakers are that those who would use violence against dialogue will always prevail as they are incapable of following the rational argument.\n\nOriginal Title: Les filles de Kamare\nReleased: 1974\nEng. Title: The Girls of Kamare\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315594/\nVideo: DivX 5.0 320x240 29.97fps\nAudio: MP3 128k 44.1kHz\nLength: 44m 11s (part1),  43m, 18s (part2)\nSize: 243.3MB (part1), 238.1MB (part2)\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: FranÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ais + English (onscreen)\nAbout: The film is a montage of Japanese soft-porn / bondage drama set in a juvenile disciplinary school, and French 16mm hardcore pornographic film. The plot follows a team of female heroes, forced into a disciplinary school, who revolt against the authorities and their screws. The original Japanese film ends in a successful riot which plays directly into ViÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©net's detournement. Unlike Dialectics, The Girls of Kamare is less self-critical and relies more on traditional conceptions of heroism.\n\nOriginal Title: Chinois, encore un effort pour ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âªtre rÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©volutionnaires \nReleased: 1977\nEng.
