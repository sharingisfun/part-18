Some continue from issue to issue, some don't.\n\nI believe these books contain the first appearances of Johnny Nemo.\n\nStrange Days featured three strips, Paradax, Freakwave and Johnny Nemo. Milligan, McCarthy and Ewins produced three issues of this psychedelic comic, it was not a great seller but it picked up a small, loyal readership. The most conventional strip, Johnny Nemo, had its own series while the more quirky Paradax had a two issue series published by Vortex Comics in 1987.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f9911f7bb4277a525d34826d0b32f62d3e2f356","amp;dn":"Peter+Milligan+-+Strange+Days+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f9911f7bb4277a525d34826d0b32f62d3e2f356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,153,17,247,187,66,119,165,37,211,72,38,208,179,47,98,211,226,243,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
