Mozart, Baudelaire, de Kooning, Proust, Fussli, Heine, Fellini, Visconti and others are all striking examples of how extraordinary creativity can be challenged and modified or destroyed and restored, all within the drama of a disease. When brain disease challenges the capabilities of artists, the changes that subsequently occur in their work provide a unique opportunity to explore the mysteries of creativity. This may also lead to a better understanding on how certain artists developed, particularly when the course of a disease corresponds with what is generally recognized as a new chapter in their work.This book offers a fascinating read for neurologists, psychiatrists, general physicians and anybody interested in art, literature, music and film.
