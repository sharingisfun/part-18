Instead, the Faces were a rough, sloppy rock &amp; roll band, able to pound out a rocker like &quot;Had Me a Real Good Time,&quot; a blues ballad like &quot;Tell Everyone,&quot; or a folk number like &quot;Richmond&quot; all in one album. Stewart, already becoming a star in his own right, let himself go wild with the Faces, tearing through covers and originals with abandon. While his voice didn't have the power of Stewart, bassist Ronnie Lane's songs were equally as impressive and eclectic. Wood's rhythm guitar had a warm, fat tone that was as influential and driving as Keith Richards' style.\n\nNotorious for their hard-partying, boozy tours and ragged concerts, the Faces lived the rock &amp; roll lifestyle to the extreme. When Stewart's solo career became more successful than the Faces, the band slowly became subservient to his personality; after their final studio album, Ooh La La, in 1973, Lane left the band. After a tour in 1974, the band called it quits. Wood joined the Rolling Stones, drummer Kenny Jones eventually became part of the Who, and keyboardist Ian McLagan became a sought-after supporting musician; Stewart became a superstar, although he never matched the simple charm of the Faces.\n\nWhile they were together, the Faces never sold that many records and were never considered as important as the Stones, yet their music has proven extremely influential over the years. Many punk rockers in the late '70s learned how to play their instruments by listening to Faces records; in the '80s and '90s, guitar rock bands from the Replacements to the Black Crowes took their cue from the Faces as much as the Stones. Their reckless, loose, and joyous spirit stayed alive in much of the best rock &amp; roll of the subsequent decades.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:aifqxqe5ldje~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:aifqxqe5ldje~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nIt wasn't all over but the shouting, but the Faces sure weren't thriving when they released their last album, Ooh La La, in 1973. The problem, of course, was Rod Stewart, who had turned into a superstar, causing innumerable tensions within the band. He had yet to decamp to America, had yet to turn to pop instead of rock &amp; roll, but he was on the cusp of that sea change. Nevertheless, on the record at least, it didn't seem like being with the Faces was a strain on him; it still seemed that he enjoyed a good night out with the boys, and Ooh La La is precisely that: a good night out, one that's blessed with some very memorable moments. If there's not quite as many as on the past two Faces platters, chalk that up to circumstance perhaps. On Long Player and A Nod Is as Good as a Wink, they were a well-oiled machine at the peak of their powers. Here they're trying to rev up -- they get there, but it's possible to hear the effort, as some of the songs fall just a little bit short of memorable. But there are some extraordinary moments here, including Rod's &quot;Silicone Grown&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Cindy Incidentally,&quot; a sweet, easy pop song. But the heart of this album really belongs to Ronnie Lane, who dominates the second side of the album, starting with the Stewart collaboration &quot;If I'm on the Late Side&quot; and running through the sweet, soft &quot;Glad and Sorry&quot; to &quot;Just Another Honky&quot; and, finally, to the raucous yet bittersweet &quot;Ooh La La,&quot; as great a song as they ever recorded and an appropriate drawing of the curtain on this tremendous band.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
