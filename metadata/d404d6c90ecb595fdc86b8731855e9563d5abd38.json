A group of privileged and westernised twenty-something friends while away their days and nights driving around town, partying, surfing the internet and smoking shisha pipes. As the country outside their world starts to crack, Hasan and his friends must face up to their relationships, angst and life choices before it is too late.\n\n[b]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1539042/[/b]\n\n\n[b]Controversy[/b]\nSlackistan has not been released in Pakistan because the director refused to make cuts to the film as requested by the country's Central Board of Film Censors (CBFC) on January 25, 2011. According to The Guardian, the CBFC objects to the movie because it has swear words in English and Urdu, and &quot;contains the words 'Taliban' and 'lesbian'. Scenes showing characters drinking. These are not the CBFC's only objections, but the main ones it's highlighted.&quot; The CBFC have also stated that, even if all cuts are made as demanded, the film would still receive a restrictive adults-only ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“18+ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ rating.&quot;\n\nIn a press release, director Hammad Khan stated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe censor boardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s verdict is oppressive, arbitrary and steeped in denial about life outside their government offices. Maybe the establishmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s view is that young Pakistanis saying words like 'Taliban' and 'Lesbian' represent a more potent threat than the bullets and bombs that are, day by day, finding increasing legitimacy in the country.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMembers of the Slackistan cast have publicly expressed their disagreement with the CBFC's decision. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis objection honestly reinforces the feeling of being voiceless that seems to be lingering in the country these days. We really are stripped of our basic right to express ourselves,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ actress Shahana Khan Khalil said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI also find it highly hypocritical for our cinemas to be allowed to show both Hollywood and Bollywood films that depict everything and a lot more are never banned by the censor board.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Actor Shahbaz Shigri said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe [in Pakistan] havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t developed the ability to scrutinize ourselves. We point fingers at others rather than correcting ourselves. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t laugh at ourselves. This limits our film industry and young film makers that will never get through to the right channels.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe CBFC's own website states that it prevents the public exhibition of films that break certain vague rules, which include &quot;giving offense to any section of the public or injured the feelings of any class of persons&quot; or &quot;ridiculing, disparaging or attacking any religious sect caste and creed.\n\n[img]http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/8400/30bmoviereel1.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/3236/slackistanpreview.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Cast[/b]\n    Shahbaz Hamid Shigri as Hasan\n    Aisha Linnea Akhtar as Aisha\n    Ali Rehman Khan as Sherry\n    Shahana Khan Khalil as Zara\n    Osman Khalid Butt as Saad\n    Khalid Saeed as Mani\n    Rafey Alam as Zeeshan\n    Adil Omar as himself\n\n[b]FILE INFO:[/b]\n[img]http://img831.imageshack.us/img831/7087/techinfo.gif[/img]\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Slackistan 2010 DVDrip {ffi4u}\\Slackistan.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1 017 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 639 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : mp43\nCodec ID                         : mp43\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nBit rate                         : 1 497 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.163\nStream size                      : 930 MiB (91%)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 79.5 MiB (8%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.78 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.2\n\nSHARING IS CARING...\nSEED please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d404d6c90ecb595fdc86b8731855e9563d5abd38","amp;dn":"Slackistan+2010+DVDrip+%7Bffi4u%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d404d6c90ecb595fdc86b8731855e9563d5abd38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,4,214,201,14,203,89,95,220,134,184,115,24,85,233,86,61,90,189,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
