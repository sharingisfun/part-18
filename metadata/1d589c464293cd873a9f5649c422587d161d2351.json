That hitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the ubiquitous '90s mainstay &quot;Barely Breathing&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½bears little resemblance to anything on Whisper House, an album that sees Sheik continue down the musical theatre path after penning the book to the incredibly successful, Tony-Award winning musical Spring Awakening. In fact, songs from Whisper House will anchor an upcoming musical of same name.\n\nThe focused purpose actually benefits the album as a wholeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Whisper House is a cohesive statement, both lyrically and musically. Heavy on atmosphere, the album evokes stark imagery from its collection of macabre, melancholic stories of a haunted lighthouse by the sea. &quot;Secret places, stolen gazes, soft exchanges / All you ever dreamed,&quot; Sheik sings on &quot;How It Feels,&quot; a lyric that fittingly describes the childlike curiosity that permeates each song.\n\nTwo of the album's standout tracks, &quot;Take a Bow&quot; and lead single &quot;Earthbound Starlight,&quot; typify the album's strengths: moody, melodic vocals seamlessly set against gorgeous instrumental arrangementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½featuring piano, bells, horns, clarinets, trumpets, cellos, guitars and more. Sheik essentially creates a kind of literary chamber pop. And those vocals are also quietly impressive, especially on &quot;I Don't Believe In You&quot;, but he wisely employs singer/pianist Holly Brook to provide back-up vocals (though she takes the lead on the stunning &quot;And Now We Sing&quot;). The two create a harmonious unity not like Damien Rice and Lisa HanniganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½their voices compliment, and indeed enhance, each other's. Even better, the ethereal timbre to Brook's voice fits nicely into the world Sheik's created on Whisper HouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a world that never escapes the feeling of being a soundtrack to a film or play you haven't seen, but a world that's worth visiting nonetheless.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.duncansheik.com/whisperhouse/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d589c464293cd873a9f5649c422587d161d2351","amp;dn":"Duncan+Sheik+Whisper+House+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d589c464293cd873a9f5649c422587d161d2351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,88,156,70,66,147,205,135,58,159,86,73,196,34,88,125,22,29,35,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
