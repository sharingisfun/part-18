Having turned his own family-run neighborhood bakery, Carlo's, into a world-renowned business -- and the subject of a hit TLC series -- Buddy Valastro knows the challenges inherent in operating a bakery, especially one that employs the owner's relatives. So he visits family-run bakeries across the country, bringing his famous blend of business skills and baking expertise to help transform the stale stores into dough-making successes. Buddy evaluates the ingredients, techniques, processes, equipment and, perhaps most importantly, the families, challenging them to make the necessary changes -- both professionally and personally -- to make their American dreams come true. Prior to the second season, the series was titled ``Bakery Boss.''
