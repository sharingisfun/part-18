After recording the album &quot;Sextant&quot; for Columbia as a one shot effort an outlet was needed for the balance of material the band had worked up until a Hancock contract with Warner Bros. could be hammered out.  Fortunately Eddie Henderson was able to secure a 2 album contract with the Capricorn label known mostly as the Southern Rock label home of The Allman Brothers, Wet Willie and ex-Iron Butterfly/Johnny Winter alumni, cosmic hard rockers Captain Beyond.  The opus was saved!  This completes the body of work that began with &quot;Sextant&quot; and ended with &quot;Crossings&quot;.  Essential for fans of this extremely creative period for these musicians.  Enjoy and please seed!;-}\n\nJunco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c0bd625c303f6a26c9c209c80477f6fc68ad50","amp;dn":"Eddie+Henderson+-+2+rare+albums%3A+Realization+%26+Inside+Out+%28Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c0bd625c303f6a26c9c209c80477f6fc68ad50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,192,189,98,92,48,63,106,38,201,194,9,200,4,119,246,252,104,173,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
