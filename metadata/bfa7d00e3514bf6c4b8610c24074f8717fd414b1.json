It was released in Japan on November 21, 1998; in North America on November 23, 1998; and in Europe on December 11, 1998. Originally developed for the Nintendo 64DD peripheral, the game was instead released on a 256-megabit (32-megabyte) cartridge, which was the largest-capacity cartridge Nintendo produced at that time. Ocarina of Time is the fifth game in The Legend of Zelda series, and the first with 3D graphics. It was followed two years after its release by the sequel The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.\n\n\nThe events of Ocarina of Time take place before those of the first four games and after The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and are set in the fictional kingdom of Hyrule, the setting of most Zelda games. Hyrule Field serves as a central hub connected to several outlying areas with diverse topography. Most of these areas are populated by the races of Hyrule: Hylians, Kokiri, Gorons, Zoras, and Gerudo.\nThe game opens as the fairy Navi awakens Link from a nightmare, in which Link witnesses a stormy night where a man on horseback, Ganondorf, chases Princess Zelda and Impa. Navi brings Link to the guardian of Link's village, the Great Deku Tree, who is cursed and near death. Link breaks the curse, but cannot stop the tree from withering. \n\n\nThe Deku Tree tells Link a &quot;wicked man of the desert&quot; has cursed him and seeks to conquer the land of Hyrule and that Link must stop him. Before dying, the Great Deku Tree gives Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the Kokiri's Emerald, and sends him to Hyrule Castle to speak with the princess of destiny, Zelda.[35] As Link is leaving, his close friend Saria bids him good luck and gives him the Fairy Ocarina, a precursor to the Ocarina of Time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa7d00e3514bf6c4b8610c24074f8717fd414b1","amp;dn":"The+Legend+of+Zelda+Ocarina+of+Time+%5BWii%5D%5BNDS%5D%5BNDSL%5D%5B3DS%5D-%7BNTSC-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa7d00e3514bf6c4b8610c24074f8717fd414b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,167,208,14,53,20,191,108,75,134,16,194,64,116,248,113,127,212,20,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
