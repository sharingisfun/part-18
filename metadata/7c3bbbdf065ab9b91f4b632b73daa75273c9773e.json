So here they are, the Top 30 U.S. Country singles as ranked by Mediabase for the week of July 29, 2014 in 320 CBR mp3 stereo.  Broadcast run times appear next to the song (the actual run time of the song will likely be a little longer if it fades out, as what radio station/satellite feed actually plays to the very last second of a song?)\n\nSee you back here in two weeks!\n\n01 Joe Nichols - Yeah \t\t\t\t\t\t(3:43)\n02 Billy Currington - We Are Tonight \t\t\t\t(3:44)\n03 Lee Brice - I Don't Dance \t\t\t\t\t(3:49)\n04 Dierks Bentley - Drunk On A Plane \t\t\t\t(4:08)\n05 Brad Paisley - River Bank \t\t\t\t\t(2:59)\n06 Chris Young - Who Am I With You \t\t\t\t(3:07)\n07 Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill - Meanwhile Back At Mama's \t\t(3:42)\n08 Lady Antebellum - Bartender \t\t\t\t\t(3:14)\n09 Kenny Chesney - American Kids \t\t\t\t(3:00)\n10 Dustin Lynch - Where It's At \t\t\t\t(3:22)\n11 Eric Paslay - Song About A Girl \t\t\t\t(3:43)\n12 Cole Swindell - Hope You Get Lonely Tonight \t\t\t(3:45)\n13 Brantley Gilbert, J.
