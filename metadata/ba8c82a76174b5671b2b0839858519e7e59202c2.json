Starting with basic principles all vital elements of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics are explained. The second part of this book treats the quantization of the radiation field, i.e. systems with infinite degrees of freedom. Beyond this a short treatment of quantum electro dynamics and electroweak interaction is given. All mathematical tools are provided and numerous examples and exercises help the student to deepen his knowledge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8c82a76174b5671b2b0839858519e7e59202c2","amp;dn":"Quantum+Physics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8c82a76174b5671b2b0839858519e7e59202c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,140,130,167,97,116,181,103,27,43,8,57,133,133,25,231,229,146,2,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
