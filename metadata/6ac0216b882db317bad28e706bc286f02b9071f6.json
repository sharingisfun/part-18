She will bring back to Ã¢â‚¬Å“lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a nineteenth-century mechanical bird. As she begins to piece the automaton together, Catherine also uncovers the diaries of Henry Brandling, who, more than a hundred years prior, had commissioned the bird for his very ill son. Catherine finds resonance and comfort in HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story. But it is the mechanical creature itself, in its uncanny imitation of life, that will link these two people across a century. Through the clockwork bird, Henry and Catherine will confront the mysteries of creation, the power of human invention, and the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s astonishing chemistry of love and feeling.\n\n\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dazzling . . . encompasses heartbreak, the comfort of absorbing work, the transformative power of beauty and the soul of an old machine. . . . part historical, part fanciful, and completely wonderful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Heller McAlpin, NPR\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ambitious, playful and engagingly strange.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€San Francisco Chronicle\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Touching and thought-provoking.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Deeply moving. . . tells the story of the essential human desire to return to the individual Edens that we inhabited. . . . beautifully told.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Nature\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ac0216b882db317bad28e706bc286f02b9071f6","amp;dn":"Peter+Carey+-+The+Chemistry+of+Tears","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ac0216b882db317bad28e706bc286f02b9071f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,192,33,107,136,45,179,23,186,210,142,112,107,194,134,240,43,144,113,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
