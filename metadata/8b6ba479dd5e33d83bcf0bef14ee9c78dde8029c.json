If you come to this record expecting the gentle sounds of the West Indies a la Joseph Spence, what you hear will shock you. This is an African record through and through. It was recorded in Baaba MaalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home with his musical compatriots shaping and influencing everything in it. And it is a magnificent album, full of the graceful, gentle rhythms of MaalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Senegalese style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b6ba479dd5e33d83bcf0bef14ee9c78dde8029c","amp;dn":"Ernest+Ranglin+-+In+Search+of+the+Lost+Riddim+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b6ba479dd5e33d83bcf0bef14ee9c78dde8029c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,107,164,121,221,94,51,216,59,207,11,239,20,238,156,120,221,232,2,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
