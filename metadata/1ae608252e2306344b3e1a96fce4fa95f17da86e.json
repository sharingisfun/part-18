No need to install - It is cracked and working for Windows 7 and lower. {needs 7-zip to extract}\n\n\n--But it doesn't include cinematics and runs very slow on Windows 8 x64 (I have the same problem running the game [Captain] Claw and maybe some other old games on Windows 8, probably a directx/dll issue. Couldn't get it working on VMWare with an 98 guest OS either).--\n\n\nThe only reason I've uploaded this is because I wanted to make it work on Win8, so I searched if there were other torrents to try, but there aren't many torrents of this game.\n\nPlease try on Windows 8 and say if it works -fast- for you.\n\n\nBtw, this is the first torrent I upload and comments are well appreciated :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ae608252e2306344b3e1a96fce4fa95f17da86e","amp;dn":"Monolith+-+Get+Medieval+%5B1988%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ae608252e2306344b3e1a96fce4fa95f17da86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,230,8,37,46,35,6,52,75,62,26,150,252,228,250,149,241,125,168,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
