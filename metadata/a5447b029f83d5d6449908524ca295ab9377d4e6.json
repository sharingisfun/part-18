Macroscopic quantum\neffects of practical relevance, for example, superconductivity and the quantum Hall\neffect, are also described. Looking to the future, the author discusses the exciting\nprospects for quantum computing.\n\nPhysical, rather than formal, explanations are given, and mathematical formalism\nis kept to a minimum so that readers can understand the concepts. Theoretical\ndiscussions are combined with a description of the corresponding experimental\nresults. This book is ideal for undergraduate and graduate students in quantum\ntheory and quantum optics.\n\nHarry Paul is a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Institute of Physics,\nHumboldt University Berlin. His research interests are in nuclear physics and\nquantum theory, especially laser theory, nonlinear optics and quantum optics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5447b029f83d5d6449908524ca295ab9377d4e6","amp;dn":"%5BE-Book%5D+introduction-to-quantum-theory.9780521876933.42200.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5447b029f83d5d6449908524ca295ab9377d4e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,68,123,2,159,131,213,214,68,153,8,82,76,162,149,171,147,119,212,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
