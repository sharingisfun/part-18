When her sister is one of the victims of a martial artist who is killing every woman who reminds him of his ex-wife, she goes looking for revenge.\n\nIts not the deepest plot, but has a few nice moments (and bad puns). Basically the film exists as an excuse to string the fight scenes together and give the fighters a reason for combat. That&amp;#039;s about it.\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
