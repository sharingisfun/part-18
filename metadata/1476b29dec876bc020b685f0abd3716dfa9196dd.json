All tracks have been digitally remastered. Released in 1978, LONG LIVE was the final Ronnie James Dio-fronted release by Rainbow. Dio would go on to front Black Sabbath, while guitarist Richie Blackmore would reunite with Deep Purple. The album caps off a string of tremendous releases from one of the strongest branches on the heavy-metal family tree. The title track is a fan favorite and one of the strongest tunes from this era--a heavy rock tune written for arenas. &amp;quot;Lady of the Lake&amp;quot; is a solid number featuring haunting background vocals. &amp;quot;L.A. Connection&amp;quot; features the piano tinglings of keyboardist David Stone. &amp;quot;Gates of Babylon&amp;quot; is a mammoth track featuring the Bavarian String Ensemble, as synthesizer and strings combine for a symphonic big-rock sound. Another standout is &amp;quot;Kill the King,&amp;quot; a speedy, full force tune with Mr. Blackmore doing what he does best. Blackmore opens the thunderous &amp;quot;The Shed (Subtle)&amp;quot; with a fluid, effects-laden bluesy solo. &amp;quot;Rainbow Eyes&amp;quot; is a seven-minute epic that features a string quartet, flute, and Dio's euphonic balladry. LONG LIVE, while not the masterwork that is RAINBOW RISING, is a strong album that ends the Dio era on a high note.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1476b29dec876bc020b685f0abd3716dfa9196dd","amp;dn":"Rainbow+-+Long+Live+Rock+%5C%27n%5C%27+Roll+%28Remastered%29+%7Beac-ape-covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1476b29dec876bc020b685f0abd3716dfa9196dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,118,178,157,236,135,107,192,32,182,133,240,171,211,113,109,250,145,150,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
