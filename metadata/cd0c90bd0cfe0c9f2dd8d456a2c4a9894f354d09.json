(BBC)\n__________________\n\nTHE KREUTZER SONATA [Stereo 32 kbit/s, 48 kHz]\n\nby Leo Tolstoy\n\nTranslated and adapted by Peter Farago, Performed by David Suchet\n\nPLOT:\n\nThe tale, told by a murderous husband, of an older, married woman's deadly infatuation for a young violinist. The work is a meditation on love, lust, hate, jealousy, women's (non) rights, and forgiveness. The title off course comes from Beethoven's Sonata #9 in A major, dedicated to the soloist Rodolphe Kreutzer (who thought it too difficult to play!).  \n\n\nCOVER:\n____________________________________________________________\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/abee5/8563798017/in/photostream&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/abee5/8563798017/in/photostream&lt;/a&gt;\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n \n\n\n                                                      (:__Abee \t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0c90bd0cfe0c9f2dd8d456a2c4a9894f354d09","amp;dn":"The+Kreutzer+Sonata%28Novella%29+By+Leo+Tolstoy.+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0c90bd0cfe0c9f2dd8d456a2c4a9894f354d09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,12,144,189,12,254,12,159,45,216,212,86,162,196,169,137,79,53,77,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
