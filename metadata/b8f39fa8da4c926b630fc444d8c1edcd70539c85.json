What Was Going Through My Head (3:10)\n\nGreat Lake Swimmers - Toronto folk/rockers led by frontman/songwriter Tony Dekker return with their fifth album in a decade and the follow up to the Juno nominated 2009 album Lost Channels...producer Andy Magoffin is again at the helm but this time Dekker and band opted for a real studio instead of their usual rustic &quot;field recording&quot; environs // Release: New Wild Everywhere (April 3, Nettwerk) // Sounds like: the studio surroundings may have been pristine but Dekker says Ã¢â‚¬Å“there is something very elemental about this album as a whole&quot; ...lead single &quot;Easy Come Easy Go&quot; is easily the band's most jubilant and upbeat track in memory, a buoyant and hummable song that sounds like it could have been lifted from some lost Workingman's Dead outtake...as usual Dekker finds that rare ability to make great songwriting look easy, creating songs of real depth that sound deceptively simple on first listen...an expanded version of NWE includes seven demos, outtakes and acoustic takes...\n\nQuote: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We wanted to try something new, expand our horizons, and flex a bit of the creative muscle weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve built up through years of touring. It came as a bit of a surprise how well we functioned as a band in that environment. We were able to focus completely on the songs, rather than the logistical obstacles of waiting for the boat to dock, or the rain to stop.&quot; - Tony Dekker // What we like: the swinging, slightly jammy quality of &quot;Easy Come Easy Go&quot; shows the band at their best as, well, a band...the classically retro &quot;New Wild Everywhere&quot; shines with a 70's Laurel Canyon glow, newcomer Miranda Mulholland adding some down home fiddle embellishments atop the multi-track harmonies and country/rock bounce...&quot;On the Water&quot; closes the album on a melancholic note as the passenger on a boat amidst a vicious storm laments on things not accomplished...\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f39fa8da4c926b630fc444d8c1edcd70539c85","amp;dn":"Great+Lake+Swimmers...New+Wild+Everywhere%28bonus+disc%29%282012%29%5BFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f39fa8da4c926b630fc444d8c1edcd70539c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,243,159,168,218,76,146,107,99,15,196,68,216,193,237,205,112,83,156,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
