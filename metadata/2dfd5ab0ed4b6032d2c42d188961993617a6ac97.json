Normally this would be of limited interest to metal fans, were it not for the impressive array of metal all-stars that appeared on his two albums. \n\nHow it was that an album featuring Chuck Schuldiner (Death), Mille Petrozza (Kreator), Dave Lombardo (Slayer), and Waldemar Sorychta (Grip Inc.) didn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t create all kinds of media hype isn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t clear, but nonetheless such an album was released. \n\nAs 1994\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Jesus Killing Machine was followed by Voodoocult in 1996 with a largely different lineup, featuring none of the aforementioned stars but including Jim Martin (ex-Faith No More). The music, at least on Jesus Killing Machine, was an aggressive, post-thrash rhythmic power metal style, certainly not reminding anyone of the member\\\\\\&amp;#039;s other bands. Boa discontinued the project after two albums, returning to his other career at least for some time afterward.
