Take advantage of these exciting new developments with Pro Java 7 NIO.2.\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\n\nHow to carry out Path class operations\nHow to get/set file metadata through the java.nio file attribute API (including POSIX)\nHow to manage symbolic and hard links (including create, delete, and find target)\nHow to deal with files and directories through the new java.nio.file.Files API\nHow to use the FileVisitor API to develop file recursive operations\nHow to explore the Watch Service API and file change notification\nHow to use the new SeekableByteChannel API for Random Access File\nHow to develop blocking/non-blocking socket-based applications\nHow to explore the jewel of NIO.2: the Asynchronous Channel API\nHow to use the Zip File System Provider and write a custom file system provider\nHow to refactor java.io.File code\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for experienced Java programmers new to Java 7 and those with some experience with Java 7.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWorking with the Path Class\nMetadate File Attributes\nSymbolic Links\nFiles and Directories\nThe FileVisitor Class: Recursive Operations\nWatch Service API\nTwo Security Models\nSPI Package\nMapping java.io.file Functionality to java.nio.file\nGeneral Methods\nBook Details\nPaperback: 296 pages\nPublisher: Apress (December 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1430240113\nISBN-13: 978-1430240112","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:788aef5f69db5516051596b744e417176d5a7911","amp;dn":"Apress.Pro.Java.7.NIO.2.Dec.2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"788aef5f69db5516051596b744e417176d5a7911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,138,239,95,105,219,85,22,5,21,150,183,68,228,23,23,109,90,121,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
