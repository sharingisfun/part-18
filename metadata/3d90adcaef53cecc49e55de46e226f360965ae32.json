While he is entering into the secrets of the organisation and lives in fear to be uncovered, Martin falls inlove in the most inappropriate woman - Djaro's girlfriend, Sunny . Just when he gains the trust of the mobsters, it appears that the real enemy is in the police. Martin is alone against all, facing difficult decisions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d90adcaef53cecc49e55de46e226f360965ae32","amp;dn":"Pod.Prikritie.S03E08.720p.WebRip.x264-ArenaBG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d90adcaef53cecc49e55de46e226f360965ae32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,144,173,202,239,83,206,204,73,229,93,228,110,34,111,54,9,101,174,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
