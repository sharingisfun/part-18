Liberating and emboldening the beginning writer are the goals of Ted Kooser and Steve Cox in this spirited book of practical wisdom that brings to bear decades of invaluable experience in writing, teaching, editing, and publishing.\n\nUnlike ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhow to writeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ books that dwell on the angst and the agony of the trade, Writing Brave and Free is upbeat and accessible. The focus here is the work itself: how to get started and how to keep going, and never is heard a discouraging word such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œno,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnot,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnever.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Because of the wealth of their experience, the authors can offer the sort of practical publishing advice that novices need and yet rarely find. Organized in brief, user-friendly chaptersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½on everything from sensory details to a work environment, from creating suspense to revising and taking criticismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the book allows aspiring (and practicing) writers to dip in anywhere and find something of value...................\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ead8de16e2997eb2e3e7f95f6d43b4bdbb8138","amp;dn":"Writing+Brave+and+Free+Encouraging+Words+for+People+Who+Want+to+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ead8de16e2997eb2e3e7f95f6d43b4bdbb8138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,234,216,222,22,226,153,126,178,227,231,249,95,109,67,180,189,187,129,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
