Exactly point by point.\n\nThis one is probably what many have been waiting for to put an accent on things. Highly recommended.\n\nDiscourse 2 deals with meditation mechanics.\nDiscourse 4 deals with issues of creativity.\nDiscourse 7 deals with meditation as related to the joyous state, the birds singing in the morning. It also deals with issues of zombification of children.\nDiscourse 9 deals with laughter.\n\nWhat a treat!\n\nThese originals were in a pretty bad shape, almost as bad as it gets.\nDiscourse 10, at least first 6-9 minutes is almost inaudible, even after extensive amount of work on it. But, after that, it is quite audible.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:674bd958b762c3a84cc12efb1180a487eadd9318","amp;dn":"Osho+-+A+Sudden+Clash+Of+Thunder+-+Remastered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"674bd958b762c3a84cc12efb1180a487eadd9318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,75,217,88,183,98,195,168,76,193,46,251,17,128,164,135,234,221,147,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
