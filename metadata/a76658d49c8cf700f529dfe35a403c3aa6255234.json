Now, in The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel, William Goldbloom Bloch takes readers on a fascinating tour of the mathematical ideas hidden within one of the classic works of modern literature.\n\nWritten in the vein of Douglas R. Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize-winning GÃƒÂ¶del, Escher, Bach, this original and imaginative book sheds light on one of Borges' most complex, richly layered works. Bloch begins each chapter with a mathematical idea--combinatorics, topology, geometry, information theory--followed by examples and illustrations that put flesh on the theoretical bones. In this way, he provides many fascinating insights into Borges' Library. He explains, for instance, a straightforward way to calculate how many books are in the Library--an easily notated but literally unimaginable number--and also shows that, if each book were the size of a grain of sand, the entire universe could only hold a fraction of the books in the Library. Indeed, if each book were the size of a proton, our universe would still not be big enough to hold anywhere near all the books.\n\nGiven Borges' well-known affection for mathematics, this exploration of the story through the eyes of a humanistic mathematician makes a unique and important contribution to the body of Borgesian criticism. Bloch not only illuminates one of the great short stories of modern literature but also exposes the reader--including those more inclined to the literary world--to many intriguing and entrancing mathematical ideas.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 224 pages\n# Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA (September 7, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0195334574\n# ISBN-13: 978-0195334579","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a76658d49c8cf700f529dfe35a403c3aa6255234","amp;dn":"The+Unimaginable+Mathematics+of+Borges%27+Library+of+Babel+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a76658d49c8cf700f529dfe35a403c3aa6255234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,102,88,212,156,140,247,0,245,41,223,227,90,64,60,58,166,37,82,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
