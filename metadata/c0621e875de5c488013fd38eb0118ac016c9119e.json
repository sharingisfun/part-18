Bit Loungy but still quite spicy.\n\n Thanks to my imaginary &quot;Best Indie&quot; friend from PB, I had a very nice weekend. It's nice to meet an idiot like myself. Some recognition maybe. Anyway we listened to some thousand songs. Most were beautiful, some clearly good and some were just to good to keep quiet. So I put these songs in my September lists (although most of them are a bit older but you might have missed them too). But whatever reason; in my ears, the list is quite special as it is. The songs really support each other. All in HQ.....
