Muir was upset that the original album, which is often considered a landmark hardcore album, was out of print at the time. Instead of reissuing the album, he decided to re-record it.\n\nWith the exception of Muir, the lineup that recorded Still Cyco is completely different from the lineup that recorded the original album. Therefore there are some obvious sound differences. The current band members are definitely more technically proficient than the original band, therefore the overall sound is much tighter and lines less sloppy. Muirs voice has also changed, as he at this point has a more pure style of singing as opposed to the screaming/ranting style of the original album. Many fans liked this version of the album but thought it was less &quot;genuine&quot;, as many of the songs on the album relied on youthful angst better exemplified by the younger band that Suicidal was in 1983 as opposed 1993.\n\nThe album's cover mimicked the original's, with the exception that Muir is the only band member to be hanging upside-down by his feet (possibly a reference to the fact that he was the only original band-member featured on the record).\n\nSingles were released for &quot;Institutionalized&quot; and &quot;I Saw Your Mommy&quot;. In addition to being a re-recording of the original album, this album also features re-recorded versions of &quot;A Little Each Day&quot; and &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; from Join the Army as well as a B-side track from 1990, &quot;Don't Give Me Your Nothin'&quot;.\n\n\n\nEpic Records\nJune 15th, 1993\n\nMike Muir - Vocals\nRocky George - Guitar\nMike Clark - Guitar\nRob Trujillo - Bass\nR.J.

They were formed in Venice, Los Angeles, California, in 1981 by the leader and only permanent member, singer Mike Muir. The band is credited as one of the &quot;the fathers of crossover thrash&quot;. To date, Suicidal Tendencies have released ten studio albums (one of which is composed of never-before material and the other is a re-recording of their first album), two compilation albums, four split albums, one VHS, and one EP.\nSuicidal Tendencies rose to fame with their 1983 self-titled debut album, which spawned the single &quot;Institutionalized&quot;. That single was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. Suicidal Tendencies did not release a follow-up record until 1987, with Join the Army. The album attracted the attention of Epic Records, who signed the band in 1988 and issued their third album, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today, later that year. This was followed by their next two albums, Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu and Lights...Camera...Revolution!, which were also successful and both certified Gold by the RIAA. After releasing two more studio albums (The Art of Rebellion and Suicidal for Life), Suicidal Tendencies called it quits in 1995. However, they reunited in 1997 and have continued to perform and record since then.\n\nGenre:\tThrash\nSubgenre:\tThrash Metal / Crossover\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t98.52 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n27 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65a58dc245444ed95d8c84d7c1ae5739487f1422","amp;dn":"Suicidal+Tendencies+-+Still+Cyco+After+All+These+Years+mp3+320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65a58dc245444ed95d8c84d7c1ae5739487f1422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,165,141,194,69,68,78,217,93,140,132,215,193,174,87,57,72,127,20,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
