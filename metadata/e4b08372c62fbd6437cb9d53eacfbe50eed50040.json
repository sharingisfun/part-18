Orenstein, &quot;Pieter Bruegel the Elder: Drawings and Prints&quot;\nMetropolitan/Yale | 1981 | ISBN: 0870999907/0300090145 | English | PDF | 323 pages | 82.94 Mb\n\nPieter Bruegel the Elder (1525/30-1569) was a remarkable draftsman and designer of prints as well as a great painter. His independent drawings and designs for engravings and etchings, which were carried out by the leading printmakers of his day, have fascinated scholars and the general public alike since they were created. They have recently been the subject of research that has given rise to a reevaluation of the parameters of Bruegel's oeuvre. The new scholarship has been brought to bear in the texts of the present volume, which accompanies a major exhibition of 140 of Bruegel's prints and drawings to be shown at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, from May to August 2001 and at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, from September to December 2001. An international group of experts discusses the new Bruegel who has emerged from recent studies, in essays on the artist's life, his contributions as a draftsman and as a printmaker, the survival of his art, and his relationship to the humanism of his day. They also illuminate his genius in entries on all the works in the exhibition. Every work is illustrated and rich comparative illustrations are included. Provenances and references for every work, a bibliography, and an index are supplied.\n\nOne of the greatest Netherlandish artists, Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1525/30Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1569) is best known today for his paintings of peasant life. Yet is was above all through his exceptional graphic work that he achieved widespread fame during the sixteenth century. His drawings and prints made after his designs, while based on traditional sources, are innovative and independent, and they are wide ranging in their subject matter.\n\nAmong Bruegel's foremost achievements in the graphic realm is the naturalistic rendering of landscapes. In many instances inspired by the Alpine mountains and valleys the artists encountered during a journey in Italy he made as a young man, these views synthesize the imagery of Bruegel's Italian and Netherlandish predecessors at the same time they represent a new and highly influential departure: an independent landscape genre entirely focused on nature. Indeed, a sixteenth-century authors famously wrote of Bruegel, &quot;he teaches us to represent ... the angular, rocky Alps, the dizzying views down into a deep valley, steep cliffs, pine trees that kiss the clouds, far distances, and rushing streams.&quot; The master also created a body of peerless figurative designs featuring demons, virtuous souls, fools, and faceless peasants tilling the land. In allegories, portrayals of proverbs, and biblical narratives he dissected the imperfections of human nature, giving free rein to his imagination and wicked sense of humor. Often Bruegel produced what one early observer called &quot;fantasies and bizarre things, dreams, and imaginations&quot; that were closely based on the work of Hieronymus Bosch and inspired his contemporaries to call him the second Bosch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4b08372c62fbd6437cb9d53eacfbe50eed50040","amp;dn":"Pieter+Bruegel+the+Elder+-+Drawings+and+Prints+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4b08372c62fbd6437cb9d53eacfbe50eed50040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,176,131,114,198,47,189,100,55,203,157,83,234,207,190,80,238,213,0,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
