We will keep the new game true to the classic experience, keeping all the things you loved while giving today's gamers the modern look and feel expected from a great game.\r\nWith the help of members from the original team, Citadel Station has never been more immersive or terrifying!\r\nâ€œWhen youâ€™re working on a game, you tend not to think about how people will feel about it 20 years later â€“ or if people will even remember it! The announcement of the System Shock update from Nightdive (and the upcoming System Shock 3 Iâ€™m working on) itâ€™s apparent that not only do people remember, they care very deeply about the game. Back when we were working on the original, we wanted to make a simulation-based game that would empower players to tell their own stories through their playstyle choices â€“ an idea thatâ€™s still totally relevant today. Iâ€™ve long said that if you updated the graphics, sound and UI on System Shock youâ€™d have something that competes directly with any game on the market today. Now the Nightdive folks are doing that update and Iâ€™m confident my prediction will be validated. SHODAN demands that you support this so we can all find out.â€ --Warren Spector, OtherSide Entertainment. Producer on the original System Shock.\r\nYou're a renowned hacker, the most notorious cyberspace thief in the corporate world. Caught during a risky break-in, you become indentured to a greedy TriOptimum executive. After six months in a healing coma, you awaken to the twisted aftermath of a terrible disaster. Where are the surgeons? Why is the station in such disrepair? Slowly, the chilling realization that something is very wrong creeps over you. Once a prime corporate research facility, Citadel Station now teems with mindless cyborgs, robots and terribly mutated beings, all programmed to serve SHODAN, a ruthless A.I. There's scarcely time to think before it unleashes the first terror...\r\nâ€œThe crew at Nightdive heroically brought the original versions of System Shock and System Shock 2 back into circulation. They have thrived as a new audience has rediscovered these classics. Now Nightdive is remastering the original System Shock to bring it up to date on modern PCâ€™s - with fully updated visuals, audio and a modern interface â€“ making it dramatically more accessible to modern gamers. Itâ€™s quite wonderful to see a franchise that Warren and I helped create get such loving care.&quot; --Paul Neurath, Founder of OtherSide Entertainment.
