The album's titles are both\r\ntaken from the opening lyrics of The Cures debut single &quot;Killing an Arab&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;New Voice - New Mix&quot; of &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; (released as a single little over a\r\nfortnight before Standing on a Beach) is not featured on the album; thus the albums\r\nsingles span only from 1978 to 1985. The same mix has never again been released onto\r\na compilation album.\r\n\r\nThe version of &quot;A Forest&quot; here is neither the album version (which was also on the\r\n12&quot; single) nor is it the 7&quot; single edit (which removes a few bars between verses\r\nand fades out part way through the guitar solo ending)\r\n\r\n\r\n01 - Killing an Arab [02:21]\r\n02 - 10:15 Saturday Night [03:38]\r\n03 - Boys Don't Cry [02:35]\r\n04 - Jumping Someone Else's Train [02:55]\r\n05 - A Forest [04:55]\r\n06 - Play for Today [03:39]\r\n07 - Primary [03:35]\r\n08 - Other Voices [04:28]\r\n09 - Charlotte Sometimes [04:14]\r\n10 - The Hanging Garden [04:22]\r\n11 - Let's Go to Bed [03:33]\r\n12 - The Walk [03:29]\r\n13 - The Love Cats [03:39]\r\n14 - The Caterpillar [03:40]\r\n15 - In-Between Days [02:56]\r\n16 - Close to Me [03:40]\r\n17 - A Night Like This [04:11]\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: The Cure\r\nGenre: Post-Punk / Alternative rock / New Wave\r\nAlbum Release Year: 1986\r\nLabel: Fiction Records\r\nASIN:: 4228292392\r\nNumber of Tracks:17\r\nTotal Duration: 1:01:58.707\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate: 813 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 L/R [Full Stereo]\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Source: Original CDs &gt; FLAC\r\nConverter: EAC V1.1 Test And Copy Secure Mode\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\r\nIncluded Artwork: [Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files]\r\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheets FLAC &amp; WAV, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP,foo_dr, and M3U\r\nTotal File Size: 365 MB\r\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8851d4145477eb27976d49c2cbebce3b539df90","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Staring+At+The+Sea+%5B1986%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8851d4145477eb27976d49c2cbebce3b539df90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,133,29,65,69,71,126,178,121,118,212,156,44,190,188,227,181,57,223,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
