These talks in The Path of the Mystic were given in Uruguay. \r\n\r\nOsho is speaking to, &quot;the millions of people who want some more consciousness in their being.&quot; He proposes a world where we are not just living together, but growing together â€“ a worldwide mystery school of people who donâ€™t just want to change society, but are willing to experiment and risk everything to find truth. \r\n\r\n&quot;Truth cannot be borrowed. It cannot be studied in books. Nobody can inform you about it. You have to sharpen yourself, your intelligence, so that you can look into existence and find it.&quot; \r\nOsho","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a3da05e7d45ea8f0142d0fac9e8bb331834145","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Path+Of+The+Mystic_%2844+video+files%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a3da05e7d45ea8f0142d0fac9e8bb331834145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,163,218,5,231,212,94,168,240,20,45,15,172,158,139,179,49,131,65,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
