Unlike the usual Ambler story, this is not a whodunit or spy story. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a study of the conflict in the mind of a mentally sick man, not absolutely certain that he hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t committed murder.\n\nJohn Mills plays Jim Ackland, an industrial chemist who suffers from a brain injury following an accident in which the child of a friend is killed. He blames himself for the childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, and develops suicidal tendencies. Released from hospital, he is warned of a possible relapse unless he takes things easy. He returns to work and lives in a suburban hotel inhabited by a small cross-section of the community Ã¢â‚¬â€œ retired business men, fussy old women, young people struggling for a job Ã¢â‚¬â€œ some well meaning and some viciously stupid.\n\nMolly (Kay Walsh), a fashion model, is being ruthlessly pursued by Peachey (Edward Chapman) a retired wolf. In a tight corner she borrows a check from Jim, who has only met her once. The following day Molly is found murdered and Jim is suspected.\n\nThis bare outline, which omits the somewhat superimposed love affair between Jim and Jenny Carden (Joan Greenwood), canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do justice to the development and treatment of the yarn, nor to the unusual angles. The dialog is taut and adult, and the direction by Roy [Ward] Baker, onetime assistant to Hitchcock, is imaginative.\n\nA Hitchcock connection unsurprisingly influences the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atmosphere, AmblerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife collaborated on scripts with Hitchcock and Ward Baker was his one-time assistant.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.03gb\nDuration.... 01:31:15\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width.... 720\nFrame Height.... 568\nData Rate....1491kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 121kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20be629c4f0c8e1317a4addfc966214fec68dd1c","amp;dn":"The+October+Man+1947+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20be629c4f0c8e1317a4addfc966214fec68dd1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,190,98,156,79,12,142,19,23,164,173,223,201,102,33,79,236,104,221,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
