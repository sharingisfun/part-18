To do this you need to use a ISO Editor and a text editor to open this files.\n* If you install this Windows XP on several computers and want a full automated installation then you need use an ISO Editor and replace the file &quot;WINNT.SIF&quot; in the &quot;(source)OEM&quot; folder with the one in the &quot;(source)I386&quot; folder. When you now Boot from this Disc then the main Hard disk drive will be formatted and a new partition will be create and Windows XP will be automatically installed on this partition. Note if you are replacing this &quot;WINNT.SIF&quot; file then you will loss the Recovery Console and the Repair Option that you could run from the Windows XP Disc.\n* If the Windows XP installation hangs or if you get a Blue Screen Error during the Windows XP installation then this is probably due to a SATA driver problem. To fix this problem you should do the steps under &quot;Infos on how to Remove the included Drivers and include your own Drivers&quot;. If you have a Blue Screen Error during the Windows XP installation then you could use a workaround for this by going into your BIOS and then by turn off the option SATA/ACHI or by changing the SATA Mode option to IDE. This should normally fix the Blue Screen Error, But with this workaround you will loss around 2 to 10 percent of your Hard disk speed.\n\n(o) Infos for Newbies:\n\n* The Minimum Computer Requirements ia a &quot;600 MHz Processor&quot; with a &quot;256 MB RAM&quot; and &quot;4 GB Hard disk drive&quot; and a &quot;Super VGA (800x600) Video Adapter&quot;.\n* If you miss some standard Windows XP programs then open the Windows XP Favorites folder and there you will find alternative links to better programs. This Windows XP programs are removed because they are outdated or they have been replaced by Microsoft with a better version, for example the free Microsoft Outlook Express that has been replaced years ago with the free Windows Live Mail program.\n* If you want to change the Windows XP CD-Key after the Windows XP installation then you use the Tool &quot;Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe&quot; that you find in the &quot;(source)OEMINFOS&quot; folder on the Burned Optical Disc and in the ISO file. You can also change the Windows XP Owner and Company with this Tool.\n* If you get a malware warning about the files &quot;Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe&quot; and &quot;Windows Genuine Advantage Crack for v1.9.0042.0.exe&quot;, this is normal because almost all Anti-Virus Programs are detecting Key Changers and Cracks as malware.\n* If you have a question or a problem then visit the Website &quot;www.zone54.com&quot;, but first make sure that you can't find the solution for your problem in 10 minutes over a Web Search Engine or over the forum search engine at &quot;www.msfn.org&quot;.\n\n\n[#] INTEGRATED APPLICATIONS AND MORE.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(o) Extras:\n\n* 7 new Windows XP Themes: (ChaNinja Style RC5 v1.0), (Luna Element Black v5.1 + CSS), (Windows 7 Colors v1.0), (Disney - It's a Magical World v1.0), (BlackMesa v1.1), (NeoGeniX LS v1.0), (Royale Remixed v1.47).\n* Some new Web Links have been added to the Windows XP Favorites folder.\n* Windows XP Key Changer (Keyfinder v1.51) and a text file with working WGA Keys.\n\n(o) Patches:\n\n* MF4SBF Patch v2.0: This fixes the Windows XP slow boot bug which is caused by the &quot;Microsoft .NET Framework NGEN v4.0.30319&quot;
