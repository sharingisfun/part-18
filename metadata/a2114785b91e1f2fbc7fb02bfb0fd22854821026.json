A property developer is turning a dilapidated former council high-rise into luxury riverside apartments and another is being demolished and rebuilt for public sector workers. The changes are happening under the gaze of those still living in the original local authority houses next door. \n\n\n8)  Part 8 \nThe Tower is now fully occupied. For the residents this is a new beginning, but it is the end of an era for Deptford. The most expensive penthouse has been bought by 27-year-old millionaire property developer Guy Bullerwell whose company buys up, on average, a house a day in south east London. The ex-council houses are rented out to young professionals who work across the river in Canary Wharf. Retired gangster Harry Hayward and his band of Deptford pensioners don't recognise their part of town now, so with his best friend fighting for his life in hospital and his funding drying up the future is not bright for the reformed villain. For Lol Gilbert the prospect of a life of lonely drug abuse without his friend Nicky is finally sinking in. But Nicky has one last surprise for his friend.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1904 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 49.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Thanks to WnA\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tower:_A_Tale_of_Two_Cities&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tower:_A_Tale_of_Two_Cities&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2114785b91e1f2fbc7fb02bfb0fd22854821026","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Tower+A+Tale+of+Two+Cities+8of8+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2114785b91e1f2fbc7fb02bfb0fd22854821026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,17,71,133,185,30,31,47,188,127,176,43,251,15,210,40,84,130,16,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
