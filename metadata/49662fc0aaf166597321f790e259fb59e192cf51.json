Reflecting the latest applications of PACS technology, PACS and Digital Medicine: Essential Principles and Modern Practice discusses the essential principles of PACS, EHR, and related technological advancements as well as practical issues concerning the implementation, operation, and maintenance of PACS and EHR systems.\n\n The book focuses on various components of PACS that use state-of-the-art technologies. The authors first present topics to consider prior to implementation, including design principles for PACS components and theory. They also cover post-installation quality control; security and privacy policies; maintenance, including upgrade/integration with other information systems; and governing standards. Each chapter includes an introduction to basic concepts and principles relevant to the topics, before exploring challenges that PACS users may encounter in daily work. Discussions are supplemented with more than 130 illustrations, along with case studies of implementation in two organizations.\n\n A useful guide and broad overview of the field, this book presents key principles and practical steps for PACS and EHR implementations and maintenance. Although the technology and standards of healthcare IT will evolve over time, the theory and practical advice found in this text will remain pertinent in the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49662fc0aaf166597321f790e259fb59e192cf51","amp;dn":"PACS+and+Digital+Medicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49662fc0aaf166597321f790e259fb59e192cf51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,102,47,192,170,241,102,89,115,33,247,144,226,89,251,89,225,146,207,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
