Ã¢â‚¬Å“I want to hire you to assassinate the Vice President of the United States,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she says. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the newly appointed head of the VPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security detail and wants Reacher to try and penetrate her teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shield, testing its efficacy against a genuine attack. Reacher has the skills and the stealth, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s totally anonymous Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how better to check security? What she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell Reacher is that a very determined and deadly team of assassins already has the VP in its sights. These men are skilled killers, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve overlooked one key element Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the presence of the equally lethal Reacher.\n\nepub,mobi and txt. enjoy and seed!
