It was the brain-child of Winston Churchill, who convinced Allied High Command that an attack at Gallipoli would also open up vital supply lines to Russia and establish a third front against Austria-Hungary . Gallipoli has become a by-word for the bravery and sacrifice of the ANZACS - the Australian and New Zealand troops who fought and died during the ten month campaign that saw an estimated 36,000 Commonwealth troops lose their lives before the ignominious Allied withdrawal in January 1916. It was not only Turkish shot and shell at infamous places such Anzac Cove and Suvla Bay that claimed so many lives, but also those other traditional hidden enemies of the soldier - sickness and disease.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f3/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7e/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/Line-of-Fire-Volume-Two-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\r\nVideo Bitrate: 2043 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x544\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.324:1\r\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 49mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 13\r\nPart Size: 800 MB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Line_of_Fire:_Volume_Two","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca40462b816c55703d95bb4f87afeedff2ff582","amp;dn":"HC+Line+of+Fire+Volume+Two+03of13+Gallipoli+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca40462b816c55703d95bb4f87afeedff2ff582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,164,4,98,184,22,197,87,3,217,91,180,248,122,254,237,255,47,245,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
