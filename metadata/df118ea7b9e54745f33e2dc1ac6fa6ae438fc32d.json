Focusing on the great battles and events of 1775, Phillips surveys the political climate, economic structures, and military preparations of the crucial year that was the harbinger of revolution, tackling the eighteenth century with the same skill and perception he has shown in analyzing contemporary politics and economics. The result is a dramatic account brimming with original insights about the country we eventually became.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df118ea7b9e54745f33e2dc1ac6fa6ae438fc32d","amp;dn":"1775+A+Good+Year+for+Revolution+by+Kevin+Phillips.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df118ea7b9e54745f33e2dc1ac6fa6ae438fc32d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,17,142,167,185,229,71,69,243,62,45,193,172,111,166,174,67,143,195,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
