IPv6 greatly improves on IPv4, the current protocol, by vastly increasing the number of available addresses and by adding enhancements for security, multimedia traffic management, routing, and network configuration. Written by a popular author and networking expert, this reference details the protocol, from its features and benefits to its packet structure and protocol processes. It also describes how to migrate to IPv6-based internetworking, with tips about coexistence with IPv4-based systems, DHCP, DNS, and routing infrastructure. It discusses how IPv6 is supported by the Windows Server 2008 family of operating systems and Windows Vista. Includes companion CD with fully searchable eBook and other references.\nKey Book Benefits\n\nOffers updated coverage of the IPv6-based stack in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista\n\nCovers applications and implications of the IPv6 protocol and migration from IPv4 to IPv6 on your Intranet\n\nIncludes companion CD with fully searchable eBook and other references\n\nAbout the Author\nJoseph G.
