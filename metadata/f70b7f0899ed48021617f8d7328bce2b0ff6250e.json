He was famous for his satirical works, particularly Vanity Fair, a panoramic portrait of English society.\n\nThackeray began as a satirist and parodist, writing papers with a sneaking fondness for roguish upstarts like Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair and the title characters of The Luck of Barry Lyndon and Catherine. In his earliest works, writing under such pseudonyms as Charles James Yellowplush, Michael Angelo Titmarsh, and George Savage Fitz-Boodle, he tended towards the savage in his attacks on high society, military prowess, the institution of marriage, and hypocrisy.\n\nHis writing career really began with a series of satirical sketches now usually known as The Yellowplush Papers, which appeared in Fraser's Magazine beginning in 1837. These were adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 2009, with Adam Buxton playing Charles Yellowplush.\n\nHe is best known now for Vanity Fair, with its deft skewerings of human foibles and its roguishly attractive heroine. The novel has been the subject of numerous television and film adaptations, the latest being 2004 British-American costume drama film directed by Mira Nair starring Reese Witherspoon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f70b7f0899ed48021617f8d7328bce2b0ff6250e","amp;dn":"William+Makepeace+Thackeray+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f70b7f0899ed48021617f8d7328bce2b0ff6250e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,11,127,8,153,237,72,2,22,23,248,215,50,139,206,43,15,246,37,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
