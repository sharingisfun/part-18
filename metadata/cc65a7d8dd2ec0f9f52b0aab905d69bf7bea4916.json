Such memories are widely recognized as keys that unlock our internal world, direct our actions, and determine the choices we make. But unlike dreams, memories are often neglected because we have no clearly established system for interpreting them. You Are What You Remember delineates EstradeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s techniques for bringing our memories to consciousness and understanding how they inform our existence-all to the end of developing a fuller, more satisfying life and relationships. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc65a7d8dd2ec0f9f52b0aab905d69bf7bea4916","amp;dn":"You_Are_What_You_Remember","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc65a7d8dd2ec0f9f52b0aab905d69bf7bea4916","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,101,167,216,221,46,192,249,245,43,10,171,144,93,105,191,123,234,73,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
