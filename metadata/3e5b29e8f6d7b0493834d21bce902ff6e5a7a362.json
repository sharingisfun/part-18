Scorn was released a collaboration between Throatruiner and Mordgrimm Records. After the release of &quot;Scorn&quot; the band parted ways with Kennedy and recruited Isidro &quot;Spy&quot; Soto to take over on drums. In June of 2013, Primitive Man signed to Relapse Records. Relapse reissued Scorn in August of 2013.\n\nIn 2014 the band released a 4 split records with bands such as Hessian, Fister, Hexis, Xaphan and one Noise tape EP in February titled P//M. For these releases the band worked with reputable underground record labels such as Halo of Flies, A389, Init Records, and Tartarus for these releases.\n\nPrimitive Man unleashed a filthy, malignant maelstrom of blackened doom on their debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœScorn. Thrillingly misanthropic in their approach, Primitive Man drench their post-apocalyptic vision of the world in waves of feedback, pummeling guitars and hopelessly frightening vocals. If a bright end of summer record is what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in need of, run as fast as you can from Primitive ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœScornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â€this is grade-a hateful, soul-annihilating music of the darkest order. Dubbed a &quot; totally malignant sounding record and one that will consume you whole if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not careful,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Cvlt Nation, commended for merging Ã¢â‚¬Å“the oppressive weight of doom with the misanthropic bile of black metalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Blabbermouth and called, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the best worst thing that has ever happened to you,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in an 8/10 review from Metal Hammer, Ã¢â‚¬ËœScornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ finds Primitive Man celebrating a slow-roasted apocalypse through seven suffocating hymns of hatred, disease and sonic deviance.\nWell that sounds like just what is needed,or a newscast. Anyway its metal get it......\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e5b29e8f6d7b0493834d21bce902ff6e5a7a362","amp;dn":"Primitive+Man+-+Scorn++MP3++320k+++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e5b29e8f6d7b0493834d21bce902ff6e5a7a362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,91,41,232,246,215,176,73,56,52,210,27,206,144,47,246,229,167,163,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
