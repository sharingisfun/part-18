She has released over twenty albums, and is a feminist icon. DiFranco identifies herself as bisexual, and has written songs about love and sex with both genders.\n\nDiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature staccato  style, rapid fingerpicking and many alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include alliteration, metaphor, word play and a more or less gentle irony, have also received praise for their sophistication.\n\nDilate is her seventh studio album, and it was released in 1996. Dilate is her highest-selling record, with U.S.  sales of over 480,000 units (according to SoundScan).*\n\n\n*From Wikipedia\n\n__________________________________Tracks___________________________________________\n\n\n   1-&quot;Untouchable Face&quot;            4:38\n   2-&quot;Outta Me, Onto You           4:35\n   3-&quot;Superhero&quot;                   4:45\n   4-&quot;Dilate&quot;                      4:48\n   5-&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;               7:07\n   6-&quot;Napoleon&quot;                    6:24\n   7-&quot;Shameless&quot;                   4:51\n   8-&quot;Done Wrong&quot;                  6:31\n   9-&quot;Going Down&quot;                  4:50\n  10-&quot;Adam and Eve&quot;                6:37\n  11-&quot;Joyful Girl&quot;                 5:04\n\n\n_________________________________Track Info________________________________________\n\n\n                               AAC Audio File\n                               256 Kbps (VBR)\n\n\n                               With Artwork.\n\n                             Encoded with iTunes.\n\n___________________________________.:END:._________________________________________\n\n\n                         Please Seed -&gt; Sharing is Caring\n\n\n                      [CONSTRUCTIVE comments are appreciated]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9873cd096d9cb68f07188de2aad7665579240214","amp;dn":"Dilate+-+Ani+DiFranco+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9873cd096d9cb68f07188de2aad7665579240214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,115,205,9,109,156,182,143,7,24,141,226,170,215,102,85,121,36,2,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
