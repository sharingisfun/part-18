Safari displays a preview of the plug-in \ncontent on a webpage's margins, but waits until you click that content before \nrunning it, so you only use energy viewing the content you want to see.\n\nThird-party data blocking\nSafari blocks third-party websites from leaving data that could be used to track \nyou online.\n\nFaster Javascript\nThanks to the faster Nitro JavaScript engine in Safari, browsing is even faster \nand more responsive.\n\niCloud Tabs autocomplete (Mountain Lion only)\nWhen you type into the Smart Search Field, Safari shows you webpages in your \niCloud Tabs, making it even easier to pick up your browsing right where you \nleft of on another device.\n\nYandex search built-in\nLeading Russian search provider Yandex is a built-in option for Russian users, \nin addition to Google, Yahoo! and Bing.\n\nSandboxed plug-ins\nSafari sandboxes popular plug-ins, making it safer to run them by restricting \nwhat they can do and what data they can access on your system. The Adobe \nFlash Player, Silverlight, QuickTime and Oracle Java plug-ins are sandboxed in \nSafari.\n\nPDF sandboxing\nLoading PDFs in SafariÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built-in PDF viewer is safer thanks to sandboxing. \nSandboxing restricts what a Ã¯Â¬ï¿½le can do or access on your system, so if PDF Ã¯Â¬ï¿½le \nyou view on the web contains malicious code, Safari can prevent it from \nharming your computer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46025ac5729acc7f97554bef50da7eca647bd13a","amp;dn":"Safari_6.1_beta_5_for_Mountain_Lion_Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46025ac5729acc7f97554bef50da7eca647bd13a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,2,90,197,114,154,204,127,151,85,75,239,80,218,126,202,100,123,209,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
