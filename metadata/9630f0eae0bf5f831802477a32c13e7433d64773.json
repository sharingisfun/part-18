On 19th\nNovember 1863 , he concluded his epic speech with the stirring phrase, &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people.&quot; Lincoln's insightful words became the most popular phrase to describe the complex system of democracy.\nEven though mankind got an apt definition for democracy only in the 19th century, democracy as a system of governance originated in Ancient Athens. Indians can take pride that our country is the largest democracy in the world. \nThis issue of Tell Me Why helps you to understand the thorny path along which the system of democracy has travelled to reach its present exalted state of grandeur.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/xlli3cmih/Story_of_Democracy_Tell_Me_Why_98.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/xlli3cmih/Story_of_Democracy_Tell_Me_Why_98.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9630f0eae0bf5f831802477a32c13e7433d64773","amp;dn":"Story+of+Democracy+%28Tell+Me+Why+%2398%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9630f0eae0bf5f831802477a32c13e7433d64773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,48,240,234,224,191,95,131,24,2,71,122,50,193,62,116,51,214,71,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
