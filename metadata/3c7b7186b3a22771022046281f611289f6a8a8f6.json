Richmond, VA\\&amp;#039;s GREGOR SAMSA shine bright here with two tracks of serene and dark ambient/rock music. Haunting and beautifully sung male and female vocals intertwine with atmospheric guitars, keys and string arrangements. One of their two tracks is a preview for their upcoming full-length album, and the other is exclusive to this release. Los Angeles, CA\\&amp;#039;s RED SPAROWES deliver two phenomenal tracks of their moving and intense instrumental creations. One exclusive new track is joined by a phenomenal demo version of a song found on their \\&quot;At The Soundless Dawn\\&quot; debut... and with members of ISIS and NEUROSIS behind this ship, RED SPAROWES continue to steer into amazing directions. In fact, both bands harken back to the glory days of shoegazing\\&amp;#039;s past without compromising their modern spin on powerful and innovative independent music.\n\n\nTrack Listings \n\n1.
