This torrent was made from a 30-year old tape and though cleaned up with the audio program Audacity, you may experience occasional lapses in quality and/or volume. The abrupt and interrupted end to the first file is an artifact of the original recording.\n\nHer hardback version of this audiobook had the full title, Overworked and Underpaid: How To Go From Being a Low-Paid Secretary to being a High Paid Secretary to Hiring Your Own Secretary. Some of the information in this audio book is dated, as you can imagine from a 30-year-old resource, but the philosophy behind the work is universal and is beneficial when combined with other work from others such as Zig Ziglar, Stephen Covey, and John C. Maxwell. Also, the philosophy is applicable to everybody regardless of occupation or gender, not just female secretaries though Carroll spends some time specifically addressing that vocation particularly.\n\nMary Bridget Carroll no longer publishes material and there is no further information on her recent activities.\n\nPlease enjoy my other torrents:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10111560/Personal_Power_-_Susan_Cocco&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10111560/Personal_Power_-_Susan_Cocco&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10032009/The_Speedlearning_System_for_a_Higher_I.Q.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10032009/The_Speedlearning_System_for_a_Higher_I.Q.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10028576/The_Secret_To_Staying_Motivated&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10028576/The_Secret_To_Staying_Motivated&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd4c828e5eff65913e08b0cf9b7b7fe3db7973a","amp;dn":"Overworked+and+Underpaid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd4c828e5eff65913e08b0cf9b7b7fe3db7973a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,212,200,40,229,239,246,89,19,224,139,12,249,183,183,254,61,183,151,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
