Shrapnel Records\\' Mike Varney was interested in forming a recording project around David, but not CJSS. CJSS recorded 2 albums before it was dissolved so David could concentrate on his recording project Chastain as well as solo releases.\n\nAfter a few CJSS reunion shows in 1999 to celebrate the re-release of their first 2 albums, a new album was recorded in 2000. Locomotive Breath is a cover of the classic Jethro Tull track.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3770d0bf753f97dd8ede4d7844c859d970b288b7","amp;dn":"CJSS+%5BDavid+T.+Chastain%5D+-+Kings+Of+The+World+%282000%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3770d0bf753f97dd8ede4d7844c859d970b288b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,112,208,191,117,63,151,221,142,222,77,120,68,200,89,217,112,178,136,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
