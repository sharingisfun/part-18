The album was initially intended as a musical experiment, blending the styles of country singer-songwriter Lynn and producer White, who wrote one track, sings a duet with Lynn, and performs on the whole album as a musician. At the time of the album's release, Lynn was 69 and White was 28.\n\nThe title refers to Lynn's origins as the daughter of a miner working the Van Lear coal mines. The album peaked at number two on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and at number 24 on the Billboard 200, the most successful crossover music album of Lynn's 45-year career.\n\nAt the Grammy Awards of 2005, Lynn was nominated for 5 awards and won 2: Best Country Album and Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for her duet with White, &quot;Portland, Oregon&quot;. Two of her other nominations were for Best Country Song: &quot;Portland, Oregon&quot; and &quot;Miss Being Mrs.&quot; &quot;Miss Being Mrs.&quot; was also nominated for Best Female Country Vocal Performance.\n\nThe song Portland, Oregon was listed as the 305th best song of the 2000's by pitchfork media.\n\nAll songs written by Loretta Lynn, except where noted:\n\n&quot;Van Lear Rose&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50 \n&quot;Portland Oregon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49 \n&quot;Trouble on the Line&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:21 \n&quot;Family Tree&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03 \n&quot;Have Mercy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35 \n&quot;High on a Mountain Top&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44 \n&quot;Little Red Shoes&quot; (Jack White) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 \n&quot;God Makes No Mistakes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:45 \n&quot;Women's Prison&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16 \n&quot;This Old House&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:56 \n&quot;Mrs. Leroy Brown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 \n&quot;Miss Being Mrs.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50 \n&quot;Story of My Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40 \n\n[edit] Personnel\nLoretta Lynn - vocals, guitar \nDave Feeny - pedal guitar, steel guitar, dobro, percussion, background vocals \nPatrick Keeler - drums, percussion, background vocals \nJack Lawrence - bass, percussion, background vocals \nDan John Miller - acoustic guitar, percussion, background vocals \nDirk Powell - fiddle, bowed bass, banjo \nJack White - electric guitar, acoustic guitar, organ, piano, percussion, background vocals \nBrendan Benson - engineer \nErin McConnell - engineer \nStuart Sikes - mixing \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46a6c6da1ff86aa4651a7532dc109bc81957dac","amp;dn":"Loretta+Lynn...Van+Lear+Rose%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46a6c6da1ff86aa4651a7532dc109bc81957dac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,106,108,109,161,255,134,170,70,81,167,83,45,193,9,188,129,149,125,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
