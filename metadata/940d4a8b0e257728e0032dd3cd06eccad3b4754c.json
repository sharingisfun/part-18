S. Lewis continues to inspire and fascinate millions. His legacy remains varied and vast. He was a towering intellectual figure, a popular fiction author who inspired a global movie franchise around the world of Narnia, and an atheist-turned-Christian thinker.\n\nIn C.S. LewisÃ¢â‚¬â€A Life, Alister McGrath, prolific author and respected professor at King's College of London, paints a definitive portrait of the life of C. S. Lewis. After thoroughly examining recently published Lewis correspondence, Alister challenges some of the previously held beliefs about the exact timing of Lewis's shift from atheism to theism and then to Christianity. He paints a portrait of an eccentric thinker who became an inspiring, though reluctant, prophet for our times.\n\nYou won't want to miss this fascinating portrait of a creative genius who inspired generations.\nSharing Widget","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940d4a8b0e257728e0032dd3cd06eccad3b4754c","amp;dn":"C.S.+Lewis_A+life+%28Biography%29+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+Epub%2FPDF_%28K-Slender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940d4a8b0e257728e0032dd3cd06eccad3b4754c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,13,74,139,14,37,119,40,224,3,45,211,205,6,236,202,211,180,117,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
