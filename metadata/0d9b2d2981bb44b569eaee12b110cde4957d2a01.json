All songs have a reference to cigarettes.  I would play this album alot while sitting in hot tub.  Her version of &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot; is as mellow, peaceful and relaxing as a song can get, in my opinion. The rest of the album is mostly the same tempo.  Great release.\n\nSearched for it on TPB and saw someone has uploaded it before, but is no longer seeded.  I shall attempt to keep it alive.\n\nMP3&amp;#039;s  192 kbps\n\nPlease click on &quot;Files&quot; number above for track listings.\n\nEnjoy and please seed!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9b2d2981bb44b569eaee12b110cde4957d2a01","amp;dn":"k.d.+lang+-+Drag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d9b2d2981bb44b569eaee12b110cde4957d2a01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,155,45,41,129,187,68,181,105,234,238,18,177,16,205,228,149,125,42,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
