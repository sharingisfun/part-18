With new sights, new characters, new (ahem) business opportunities, and even a whole new '80s themed era, players can indulge in more criminal fun than ever before. Vice City features more expansive locations, and over 120 vehicles ripe for the picking such as exotic cars, motorcycles, luxury yachts and planes. The soundtrack boasts three times the tunes compared to the previous GTA, and features countless '80s hits. Over 40 different weapons ensure effective firepower and provide enough variety for stylish defensive measures (samurai sword anyone?).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e4dfaed68544aae4017d7d748ec17935c9c5666","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto%3A+Vice+City+%5BPS3%5D+%5BGTA%3AVC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e4dfaed68544aae4017d7d748ec17935c9c5666","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,77,250,237,104,84,74,174,64,23,215,215,72,236,23,147,92,156,86,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
