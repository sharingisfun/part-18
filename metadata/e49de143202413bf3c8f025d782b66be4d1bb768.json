Release: 1993. \n\nHere's the usual exhaustive, prestigious, and expensive package(six CDs and a book) from Germany's Bear Family, the best roots music reissue company in the world. Covering the years 1949 to 1965, the set chronicles Walker's career from his initial, tentative Capitol cuts through his entire career on Columbia. \n\nThe singer, known as the Travelling Texan and Masked Singer of Country Songs, was among the first to share a stage with Elvis and last to tour with Hank Williams. He later cheated death on the 1963 plane-flight that took Patsy Cline, Cowboy Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins when Hawkins gave him a ticket for another plane. Walker had 32 top 10 hits - &quot;Charlie's Shoes&quot; was selected as one of the Top 100 Hot Country Singles of all time. He died at 77 in 2006.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e49de143202413bf3c8f025d782b66be4d1bb768","amp;dn":"Billy+Walker+-+Cross+The+Brazos+At+Waco+-+1949-1965+-+6CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e49de143202413bf3c8f025d782b66be4d1bb768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,157,225,67,32,36,19,191,60,143,2,93,120,43,102,190,77,27,183,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
