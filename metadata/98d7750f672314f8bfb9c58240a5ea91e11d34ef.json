Both had previously played with ex-Fairport Sandy Denny, to whom Lucas was married, in the short-lived Fotheringay. Here they had effectively replaced Simon Nicol who had quit Fairport to join another ex-member Ashley Hutchings in The Albion Band, thus leaving the band with no original members until he rejoined in 1976.\n\nDrummer Dave Mattacks also joined the Albion Band for a while but rejoined during the making of Rosie. He only plays on four of the ten tracks; on others drums are handled alternately by Tim Donald and Gerry Conway. Like Donahue and Lucas, Conway was also ex-Fotheringay, and would himself join Fairport in 1999; he remains with them to this day.\n\nReleased February 1973 \nRecorded July - August 1972 at Sound Techniques, London (except tracks 3 and 5: 1971) \nGenre Folk-Rock \nLabel Island Records \nProducer Trevor Lucas \n\n\n Track listing\n&quot;Rosie&quot; (Dave Swarbrick) \n&quot;Matthew, Mark, Luke &amp; John&quot; (Dave Pegg, Dave Swarbrick) \n'Knights Of The Road&quot; (Trevor Lucas, Peter Roche) \n&quot;Peggy's Pub&quot; (Dave Pegg) \n&quot;The Plainsman&quot; (Words: Peter Roche/Music: Traditional arranged Trevor Lucas) \n&quot;Hungarian Rhapsody&quot; (Dave Pegg) \n&quot;My Girl&quot; (Dave Swarbrick) \n&quot;Me With You&quot; (Dave Swarbrick) \n&quot;The Hen's March Through The Midden&quot; (Traditional arranged Fairport Convention) \n&quot;Furs and Feathers&quot; (Dave Swarbrick) \nA 2004 Island issue, in addition to the previous tracks, featured also the following bonus tracks:\n\n&quot;Matthew, Mark, Luke &amp; John&quot; (Pegg/Swarbrick/Mattacks/Thompson/Nicol) \n&quot;The Hens March Through The Midden &amp; The Four Poster Bed&quot; (trad.
