As novelty artists go, Jones was one of the best. He hired great musicians for his Cityslickers, he wrote memorable songs, and he was a snappy dresser, too. This set features more of the musician than you'll ever need, nice liner notes, and great music (that still sounds hilarious after all these years) make it a steal. \n(Jason Verlinde, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nSpike Jones - Strictly For Music Lovers\n(4CD Proper Box UK 2005)\n\n 1.
