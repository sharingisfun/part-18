It begins with a rapid overview of Dart language and tools, including features like interacting with the browser, optional typing, classes, libraries, and concurrency with isolates. After you master the core concepts, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll move on to running Dart on the server and creating single page HTML5 web applications.\n\nDart is a web programming language developed by Google. It has modern OO features, just like Java or C#, while keeping JavaScriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dynamic and functional characteristics. Dart applications are Ã¢â‚¬Å“transpiledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to JavaScript, and they run natively in Dart-enabled browsers. With production-quality libraries and tools, Dart operates on both the client and the server for a consistent development process.\n\nDart in Action introduces the Dart language and teaches you to use it in browser-based, desktop, and mobile applications. Not just a language tutorial, this book gets quickly into the nitty-gritty of using Dart. Most questions that pop up while youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reading are answered on the spot! OO newbies will appreciate the gentle pace in the early chapters. Later chapters take a test-first approach and encourage you to try Dart hands-on.\n\nTo benefit from this book youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need experience with HTML and JavaScript?a Java or C# background is helpful but not required.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Inside\n- Dart from the ground up\n- Numerous code samples and diagrams\n- Creating single-page web apps\n- Transitioning from Java, C#, or JavaScript\n- Running Dart in the browser and on the server\n\nTable of Contents\nPart 1: Introducing Dart\nChapter 1.
