Main Street vividly draws the lines of tension between tradition and progress in ways that make them timeless, yet still new. \n\n  Carol Milford, educated, sophisticated, and energetic, has ambitious plans for her life. Her studies have prepared her to join an enlightened, progressive society. But after she becomes Carol Kennicott, the wife of a small town physician, she quickly learns that she is to be nothing more than a gracious wife. Frustrated and torn between the challenge of social change and the comfort of personal security, she begins to understand the cost of conformityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and rebellion. \n\n  Sinclair LewisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perceptive tale has been a milestone in American literature since it was published in 1920. Conveying all the hope and optimism of a generation who sought to use their education and prosperity to make a more perfect country, his heroine still stands for the youthful exuberance of our nation.\n\n - - - - -\nFrom AudioFileMagazine.com:\n\nOccasionally author, novel and narrator mesh really well; so it is with this reading of Lewis's satirical, yet affectionate, portrait of small-town America in the 1920's. The modern parallel is Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon. Protagonist Carol Kennicott fails to transform the dull ordinariness she finds in Gopher Prairie, but her attempt is grand and grandly told by Barbara Caruso. Caruso's wry voice provides just the right characterizations for the frustrated Kennicott; her patient, but misunderstanding, husband; and the uncertain townspeople. Listeners will sense in Caruso's reading what is conveyed in Lewis's writing--raised eyebrows, knowing looks, a mix of condescension and tolerance. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4419635d5f3a539149935b015463c16a79c8a94","amp;dn":"MAIN+STREET+-+Sinclair+Lewis.+Read+by+Barbara+Caruso+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4419635d5f3a539149935b015463c16a79c8a94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,65,150,53,213,243,165,57,20,153,53,176,21,70,60,22,167,156,138,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
