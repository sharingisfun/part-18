It was later released in the United States on February 9, Japan on February 10, and Germany on February 12. The album's title is an allusion to Magick in Theory and Practice, a book by British occultist Aleister Crowley.Sounds and themes\n\nThe album title was inspired by frontman Ville Valo's relationships that have since ended. He told Kerrang!: &quot;It's a sonic diary of that [affair]. The album's also about both the theoretical and practical aspects of relationships which are an impossible problem to resolve. 'Screamworks' represents a cathartic, primal scream; it's a big middle finger; it's a fuck off, I want to do what I want to do.&quot;[23]\n\nValo has stated that the song &quot;In Venere Veritas&quot; features an iPhone because a real instrument did not meet their expectations, and &quot;Disarm Me (With Your Loneliness)&quot; was originally written for Dark Light but the rest of the band felt it didn't suit the album.\n\nA remix version of Screamworks, titled SWRMXS and featuring remixes by Huoratron, Mercyfvcks, and Salem, was released on 7 December 2010.[24]\n\nThe album has been described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦melodramatic late-'80s/early-'90s melodic alt-rock in the vein of New Model Army, Dream Theater, and Mission UK [and] serves as an efficient yet predictable vehicle to deliver the primal scream that is heartbreakÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½[25]\n\nSpin magazine said of the album: Ã¢â‚¬Å“They sound] like a pro forma emo-fed hard-rock band with some likably silly Euro-doom flourishes.&quot;\n\nAlternative Press said of the album: &quot;When the band are a little more concrete and less spooky, the results are especially compelling.... Ultimately successful in its blending of melody and muscle.&quot;\nTracklist\n\nAll songs are composed by Ville Valo.\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;In Venere Veritas&quot;   \t3:36\n2. \t&quot;Scared to Death&quot;   \t3:41\n3. \t&quot;Heartkiller&quot;   \t3:29\n4. \t&quot;Dying Song&quot;   \t3:32\n5. \t&quot;Disarm Me (With Your Loneliness)&quot;   \t4:02\n6. \t&quot;Love, the Hardest Way&quot;   \t3:20\n7. \t&quot;Katherine Wheel&quot;   \t3:26\n8. \t&quot;In the Arms of Rain&quot;   \t3:47\n9. \t&quot;Ode to Solitude&quot;   \t3:58\n10. \t&quot;Shatter Me with Hope&quot;   \t3:52\n11. \t&quot;Acoustic Funeral (For Love in Limbo)&quot;   \t3:58\n12. \t&quot;Like St. Valentine&quot;   \t3:15\n13. \t&quot;The Foreboding Sense of Impending Happiness&quot;   \t3:14\nTotal length:\n\t44:30 \t\nBaudelaire in Braille\n\nThe deluxe edition of Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice contains a bonus disc that has all thirteen tracks from the album but in acoustic form, titled Baudelaire in Braille.
