The magical imagery of the Elizabethan world, the baroque glories of Charles I and the majesty of Sir Christopher Wren's St Paul's are among the highlights.\n\nPart 3: My Wife, My Horse and Myself\nWriter and presenter Andrew Graham-Dixon travels back to the 18th century, the golden age of British art. He looks at the rich visual world of the aristocracy, from art depicting the great English informal landscape garden to studies of the aristocrat's racehorse, wife, dog and mistress and explore the works of artists like Hogarth, Stubbs and Gainsborough.\n\nPart 4: Modern Art\nAndrew Graham-Dixon visits the Norfolk and Essex landscapes of the paintings of Turner and Constable. He also looks into the worlds of William Blake and Henry Fuseli.\n\nPart 5: All Change\nAndrew Graham-Dixon explores the deeply ambivalent attitude of 19th century artists to scientific, technological and social changes in Britain. Their instincts may have been conservative but their search for beauty was intense.\n\nPart 6: Our House\nIn the final programme, Andrew Graham-Dixon traces the development of modern art in Britain.\n\n\n\nFormat                               : AVI\nOverall bit rate                  : 1,189 Kbps\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                            : XviD\nDuration                             : 48mn 58s\nBit rate                               : 960 Kbps\nWidth                                 : 720 pixels\nHeight                                 : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio            : 5:4\nframe rate                          : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                                 : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                    : Version 1\nFormat profile                     : Layer 2\nBit rate                                 : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                           : 2 channels\nSampling rate                      : 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e9c9d2f3f818bf1ce5bc9e10bf3d921c0b38e61","amp;dn":"A+History+of+British+Art+-+Series+1+%281996%29+%5BVHSrip+%28DivX%29%5D+%5BAndr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e9c9d2f3f818bf1ce5bc9e10bf3d921c0b38e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,156,157,47,63,129,139,241,206,91,201,225,11,243,217,33,192,179,142,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
