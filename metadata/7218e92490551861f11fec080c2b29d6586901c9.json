He loves to have adventures while he's traveling for work and, of course, he drives a pick-up truck. While Mike is king of the hill at work, he's the odd man out in a home that is dominated by women -- namely his wife, Vanessa, and their three daughters, 22- year-old Kristin, 17-year-old Mandy and 14-year-old Eve. After being a stay-at-home mom for years, Vanessa recently returned to the workplace and was quickly promoted (much to the dismay of her primarily male co-workers). As a result of Vanessa's increased work load, Mike is pulled into more hands-on parenting than ever before.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7218e92490551861f11fec080c2b29d6586901c9","amp;dn":"Last.Man.Standing.US.S04E05.HDTV.x264-BATV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7218e92490551861f11fec080c2b29d6586901c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,24,233,36,144,85,24,97,241,31,236,8,12,43,41,214,88,105,1,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
