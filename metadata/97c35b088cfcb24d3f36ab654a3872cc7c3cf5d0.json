In the late 1980s the orphaned Karl Koch invests his heritage in a flat and a home computer. At first he dials up to bulletin boards to discuss conspiracy theories inspired by his favorite novel, R.A. Wilson's &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, but soon he and his friend David start breaking into government and military computers. Pepe, one of Karl's rather criminal acquaintances senses that there is money in computer cracking - he travels to east Berlin and tries to contact the KGB.\n\n\nVideo quality: DVD Rip\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 953 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: AC3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: Dolby AC3 (6 channels, 48000 Hz)\nResolution: 720 x 392\nFormato de Tela: Outros\nFrame Rate: 25.000 FPS\nSize: 1.4 Gb\nSubtitles: pt and en_US","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c35b088cfcb24d3f36ab654a3872cc7c3cf5d0","amp;dn":"23+Nothing+is+as+it+Seems+-+DVDRip+AC3+xvid+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c35b088cfcb24d3f36ab654a3872cc7c3cf5d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,195,91,8,140,252,178,77,63,54,171,101,74,56,114,204,124,60,245,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
