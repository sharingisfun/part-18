A third division player from Santiago de Chile is bribed, but does not realise that his behaviour betrays more than the loyalty of his team-mates. A boy from Calama, Chile wins the local derby pichanga, a soccer match that can last all afternoon, but he loses the few pesos he acquired by pawning his mother's last possessions. Francisco, a boy from the city, is stuck in a remote corner of the southern island of ChiloÃƒÂ© on the day that Chile has to play its qualifying match for the World Cup. The only TV is in the house of the SerÃƒÂ³n sisters. While the local male population gathers to watch the match, the sisters decide which of them will initiate the young Francisco into love.\n\n\n\nVÃƒÂ­deo: DVD Rip - MPEG-4 AVC - 2.006 Kbps - 702 x 378 (Widescreen (16x9))\nÃƒï¿½udio: AC3 - 192 kbps\nAspect Ratio: 1.857\nFrame Rate: 29.970 FPS\n1,235 GB\n\nSubtitles: pt-br; en; heb;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fac1b3162401d09a8a291abe206c8e9425af6fde","amp;dn":"Andres+Wood+-+Historias+de+f%26uacute%3Btbol+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fac1b3162401d09a8a291abe206c8e9425af6fde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,193,179,22,36,1,208,154,138,41,26,190,32,108,142,148,37,175,111,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
