The first attempt, which resulted in both 2007's The Desertshore Installation and 2008's The Third Mind Movements, was a failure.\n\nThis second attempt, minus infamous member Genesis P-Orridge and a slew of guest vocalists, was finally released in 2012 along with a second disc of more classic TG soundscapes and Industrial growls and a digital album companion album that completely turns Desertshore inside out, was finally released, but with the unfortunate passing of prominent member and founder of Coil and Soisong Peter &quot;Sleazy&quot; Christopherson and a the demise of both TG and the spur of the moment group X-TG, which these three releases were issued by this brief lived group.\n\n\nBoth Desertshore and The Final Report were ripped from the actual CD pressing, whereas Faet Narok was purchased in lossless quality for the sake of maximum audio quality and are all presented here in FLAC files.\n\nFans of Throbbing Gristle, classic industrial music, EinstÃƒÂ¼rzende Neubauten, Nico's original recording of Desertshore and all around music that's far away from mainstream clutter, this is highly recommended.\n\n\nR.I.P. Sleazy, R.I.P. Throbbing Gristle and R.I.P. X-TG. Thanks for the (terrifying) memories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c9e3d5c8f693b03e00210b787555c0ca2cd776d","amp;dn":"X-TG+-+Desertshore%2FThe+Final+Report%2FFaet+Narok+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c9e3d5c8f693b03e00210b787555c0ca2cd776d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,158,61,92,143,105,59,3,224,2,16,183,135,85,92,12,162,205,119,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
