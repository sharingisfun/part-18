This practical guide shows intermediate to advanced JavaScript developers how Promises can help you manage asynchronous code effectivelyâ€”including the inevitable flood of callbacks as your codebase grows. Youâ€™ll learn the inner workings of Promises and ways to avoid difficulties and missteps when using them.\r\n\r\nThe ability to asynchronously fetch data and load scripts in the browser broadens the capabilities of JavaScript applications. But if you donâ€™t understand how the async part works, youâ€™ll wind up with unpredictable code thatâ€™s difficult to maintain. This book is ideal whether youâ€™re new to Promises or want to expand your knowledge of this technology.\r\n\r\nUnderstand how async JavaScript works by delving into callbacks, the event loop, and threading\r\nLearn how Promises organize callbacks into discrete steps that are easier to read and maintain\r\nExamine scenarios youâ€™ll encounter and techniques you can use when writing real-world applications\r\nUse features in the Bluebird library and jQuery to work with Promises\r\nLearn how the Promise API handles asynchronous errors\r\nExplore ECMAScript 6 language features that simplify Promise-related code","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaab3a3d3550759bbba61f8288312262e0d9676d","amp;dn":"JavaScript+with+Promises+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29+%28Pdf%2C+Epub%2CMobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaab3a3d3550759bbba61f8288312262e0d9676d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,171,58,61,53,80,117,155,187,166,31,130,136,49,34,98,224,217,103,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
