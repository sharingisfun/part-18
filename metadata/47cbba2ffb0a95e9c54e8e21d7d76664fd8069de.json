Cale, born John Weldon Cale on December 5, 1938, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, U.S.A., is a Grammy Award-winning American singer-songwriter and musician. Cale is one of the originators of the Tulsa Sound, a loose genre drawing on blues, rockabilly, country, and jazz influences. Cale's personal style has often been described as &quot;laid back&quot;. \nHis songs have been performed by a number of other musicians including &quot;After Midnight&quot; and &quot;Cocaine&quot; by Eric Clapton ,&quot;Cajun Moon&quot; by Randy Crawford, &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Cajun Moon&quot; by Poco, &quot;Bringing It Back&quot; by Kansas, &quot;Call Me the Breeze&quot; and &quot;I Got the Same Old Blues&quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd, and &quot;Sensitive Kind&quot; by Carlos Santana.\n\n- LINKS\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.jjcale.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.jjcale.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- AVAILABLE DISCOGRAPHY FOR THIS COMPILATION:\n1971_Naturally\n1972_Really\n1974_Okie\n1976_Troubadour\n1979_5\n1981_Shades\n1982_Grasshopper\n1983_8\n1990_Travel-Log\n1992_Number 10\n1994_Closer To You\n1996_Chronicles\n1996_Guitar Man\n1997_Anyway The Wind Blows_The Anthology\n1997_The Very Best Of J.J.Cale\n2001_Live\n2004_At The Gothic Theater [bootleg]\n2004_To Tulsa And Back\n2007_Rewind_The Unreleased Recordings\n2009_Roll On\n\n- COVER IMAGES\nThe original cover art (for the single/LP or CD) is included in the Info Tag of the mp3 file\n\n- LYRICS\nLyrics are included in the torrent (PDF file)\n\n-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nI would like to thank all the beautiful web sites from which I &quot;leeched&quot; all the information, images and lyrics.
