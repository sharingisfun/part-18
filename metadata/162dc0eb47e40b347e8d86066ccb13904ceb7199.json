He\\'s a master guitarist in his own right (he was a mainstay of Chess sessions in the \\'50s), a musical adventurer when allowed to be, and a capable, if rather dry, singer. He played mainly acoustic guitar, and his recordings when he played on electric guitar is rather rarity.\nThis live album, was captured in Tokyo, Japan at the Park Tower Blues Festival on December 9 and 10, 1995.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162dc0eb47e40b347e8d86066ccb13904ceb7199","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Robert+Jr.+Lockwood+-+Swings+In+Tokyo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162dc0eb47e40b347e8d86066ccb13904ceb7199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,45,192,235,71,228,11,52,126,141,134,6,108,203,19,144,76,235,113,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
