Oozing faux continental charm, Anton Walbrook inveigles his way into the confidence of the young mistress (Diana Wynyard) of a large Victorian mansion. Walbrook is searching for the rubies that he&amp;#039;d stolen from the previous owner of the house -- whom he&amp;#039;d also murdered. Suspecting that Wynyard is about to catch on to his secret, Walbrook enlists the aid of a sluttish maidservant to drive his loving bride crazy. The ploy almost works, but Wynyard is rescued by an unexpected ally. Gaslight was released in the U.S. as Murder in Thornton Square, then withdrawn entirely on the occasion of MGM&amp;#039;s expensive 1944 remake of Gaslight, which starred Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman. To avoid confusion, MGM allegedly ordered that all prints of the original Gaslight be destroyed. Evidently that order was not honored to the letter, since the 1940 Gaslight is still safely available for both theatrical and TV exhibition.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Gaslight 1940.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.07 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 1818 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 10.2 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : English\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Unknown\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 1707 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.231\n      StreamSize : 1.00 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 102 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 61.3 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0031359\n\nEnglish audio, English, Spanish, Portuguese and Thai subpack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42e1ee718f0493447e719cf9f1a87eba424d1d2","amp;dn":"Gaslight+%281940%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42e1ee718f0493447e719cf9f1a87eba424d1d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,46,30,231,24,240,73,52,71,231,25,207,159,26,135,235,164,36,209,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
