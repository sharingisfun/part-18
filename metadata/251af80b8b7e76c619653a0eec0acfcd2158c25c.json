Explanations are concise and nicely worded. Illustrations, pictures, and diagrams are very useable and useful. The special essays, 'A Chemist Looks At' and 'Instrumental Methods,' are well done and present students with a look at some of the chemistry they might miss in an ordinary text.&quot; -- Review --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\nProduct Description:\nSpecially updated to include instant access to OWL, the only online learning system specifically designed to support mastery learning, this ENHANCED NINTH EDITION of GENERAL CHEMISTRY helps readers master quantitative skills and build a lasting conceptual understanding of key chemical concepts.
