One day during a skating session, a plan formulates in Nick&amp;#039;s mind....getting Lexie back on the skating circut. They practice and she re-learns her way on the ice. Everyone in competiton thinks she has gotten her sight back, she skates beautifully! Problems arise again when the skate is over and everyone throws roses on the ice...Nick and Lexie did not plan for this! Lexie falls, and the jig is up....everyone knows she is blind! Struggling on her hands and knees on the ice, Nick walks out and picks her up and tells her everything is ok, and walks her back to the middle of the rink......they kiss, the crowd cheers...credits roll. \n\nRobby Benson and Lynn Holly Johnson are great in their roles. Tom Skeritt and Colleen Dewhurst round out the cast as the overprotective father (Skeritt) and Lexie&amp;#039;s skating coach (Dewhurst). The Theme song for this movie is wonderful. If you have not seen this movie.....watch it, it is a must!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828327ab2f918b1b8fd94e65094d340c90f37c8a","amp;dn":"ICE+CASTLES+%5BDVDRiP%5D+%5BXViD%5D+by+Wingtip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828327ab2f918b1b8fd94e65094d340c90f37c8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,131,39,171,47,145,139,27,143,217,78,101,9,77,52,12,144,243,124,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
