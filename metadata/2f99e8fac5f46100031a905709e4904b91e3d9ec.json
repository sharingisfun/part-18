With new tech group (States) and new governments (American and Mexican governorships, Canadian premierships), new units and some 200 provinces using modern borders! \n\nTHIS MOD IS INTENDED TO BE PLAYED BY ITSELF, compatible with all Paradox DLC. However your results may vary if you use other mods in conjunction with this mod. I am not providing support if you're running another mod in conjunction with this that also modifies the map (they're mutually exclusive to one another to begin with), changes tags of nations (very easy for tag conflicts), and modifies the province numbers and province history (confuses the game like crazy). Graphic mods should be safe but I make no guarantees.
