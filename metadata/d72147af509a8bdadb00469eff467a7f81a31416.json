To understand this risky experiment, presenter Dr Lucy Worsley has been given access to treasures from the Royal Collection as they are prepared for a new exhibition at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace - providing a rare and personal insight into George I and his feuding dynasty.\n \nThe Hanoverians arrived at a moment when Britain was changing fast. Satirists were free to mock the powerful, including the new royals. The Hanoverians themselves were busy early adopters of Neo-Palladian architecture, defining the whole look of the Georgian era. When the French philosopher Voltaire visited, he found a 'land of liberty' unlike anything in Europe - Britain was embracing freedom of speech and modern cabinet government\n\n\n \n \n\n1/3 In 1714, Britain shipped in a ready-made royal family from the German state of Hanover.\n \n2/3 How George II had to adapt to a society no longer content with being downtrodden subjects.\n \n3/3 How the final years of George II's reign transformed Britain into a global superpower.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01wq65t&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01wq65t&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n\n \nThe First Georgians: The German Kings Who Made Britain - S01 - E01\nThe First Georgians: The German Kings Who Made Britain - S01 - E02\n\n \n\nThe First Georgians - The Birth Of Botany (2 Minutes)\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : The First Georgians - The German Kings Who Made Britain.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 700 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 13s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 653 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 13s\nBitrate                     : 1 532 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.205\nStream size                 : 649 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 13s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 108 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 45.6 MB (7%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 574 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d72147af509a8bdadb00469eff467a7f81a31416","amp;dn":"The+First+Georgians+-+S01+-+E01+And+02+-+History+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d72147af509a8bdadb00469eff467a7f81a31416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,33,71,175,80,154,139,218,219,0,70,158,255,70,122,127,129,163,20,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
