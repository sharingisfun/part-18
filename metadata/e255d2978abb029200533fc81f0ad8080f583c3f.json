Like The Black Cat (1934), the link \nbetween PoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work and the end film is minimal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ indeed as is a common \ndevice in most Poe films, the works of the writer are slotted in by \nmaking the main character a Poe fan.\n\nAs well as being thematically similar to the earlier Black Cat, The \nRaven shares most of its plot flaws. Lugosi and Karloff share top billing, \nand together account for most of the screen time and characterisation; but \nthe Thatcher family, who are the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“good-guysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, get almost no character at \nall, especially JeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e who should be the hero of the piece; by the \nend we are rooting for Voller not Thatcher. The sudden arrival of a random \nmix of characters at the party Voller organises, come out of nowhere, with \nno mention of them previously, or of who invited them - they also add a little \nneeded comic relief that damages the horrific atmosphere. The filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pacing is \nslow, and although the climax is strong and tense the ending is far too sudden \nand very poor. On a positive note, the film does have a few good sequences \nhearing Lugosi recite part of the original Poe poem is a treat; while Bateman's \nawakening after the surgery, as he sees himself in the mirrors, looks straight \nout of a Frankenstein film and is acted well.\n\n(Film Trailer)\n\nThe film's direction is mediocre, Lew Landers is little more than a studio hack, \nand with the exception of one nice tracking shot along a corridor, does nothing \nto bring out the dramatic gothic sets and torture chamber. The set design is \ndecent although does not compare to the magnificence of the early Universal \nhorrors, or the hellish art-deco designs of The Black Cat. Karloff's hideous \nmake-up, from the expert Jack Pierce, looks okay in long shot, but suffers under \nthe frequent close-ups. The music is a standard Universal affair, with the usual \nhints of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.\n\nBela Lugosi is on usual form as the creepy doctor, his line readings are as good \nas ever and he even pulls off a manic laugh without looking clich'; despite the \nfilm, he is on good form here. Karloff gets a lesser role, and spends much of the \nfilm with half his face plastered over, but unlike his famous Frankenstein (1931) \nportrayal he gets little chance to display any range, only the sequence when he \nawakens after surgery allow him any chance to act. Samuel Hinds as Judge Thatcher \nis pretty unimpressive, and it is a pity that Edward Van Sloan was not used in a \npart that would have suited him. The remainder of the cast fade into the background, \nnone given a big enough part.\n\nUltimately, The Raven suffers from the same fate as The Black Cat (1934) with \nLugosi and Karloff given most of the storytime, and no build up of the supposed \ngood-guys. While the earlier film at least looked pretty good, Lander's direction \nhere does nothing to bring out the gothic potential in the house or settings, or \nbuild up much tension. Bela LugosiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance is the only thing that saves the \nfilm from being completely forgettable, even Karloff suffers in an underwritten role. \nRecommended only to Lugosi fans or Universal completists.\n\n-------------- SCREENSHOTS ----------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33081.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33081.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33082.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33082.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33083.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33083.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33084.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33084.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33085.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33085.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33086.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33086.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33087.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33087.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------------------------------------------   \n\n   General\n   \n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 700 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 1mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 600 Kbps\n      Writing library : VirtualDub-MPEG2 build 24586/release\n   \n   Video \n      \n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 1mn\n      Bit rate : 1 511 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.205\n      Stream size : 661 MiB (94%)\n      Writing library : DivX 6.8.4\n   \n   Audio \n      \n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 1mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 80.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 35.0 MiB (5%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 512 ms\n      \n    Source\n \n       Region One DVD (NTSC) 720 x 480 29.970 fps 1.33:1 (4:3)\n       Color AC3 Mono 2CH CBR 192 Kb/s 48.0 KHz\n\n\n     Encode Note\n\n      Aspect 100% correct.
