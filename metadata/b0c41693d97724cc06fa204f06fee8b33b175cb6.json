Within minutes they are disoriented, in deeper than seems possible, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lost one another. The boy's cries are more and more desperate. What follows is a terrifying, entertaining, and masterfully told tale, as only Stephen King and Joe Hill can deliver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0c41693d97724cc06fa204f06fee8b33b175cb6","amp;dn":"In+the+Tall+Grass+By+Stephen+King+And+Joe+Hill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0c41693d97724cc06fa204f06fee8b33b175cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,196,22,147,217,119,36,204,6,250,32,79,6,254,232,179,59,23,92,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
