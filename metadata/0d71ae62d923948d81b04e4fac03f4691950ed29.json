[96] (2004)\n\nGive Me A Break - How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media... \nAbridged\n05:40:04\n96kbps\nPublication date: January 08 2004\n\nBallooning government? Millionaire welfare queens? Tort lawyers run amok? A $330,000 outhouse, paid for with your tax dollars? John Stossel says, &quot;Give me a break.&quot;\n\nWhen he hit the airwaves thirty years ago, Stossel chased snake-oil peddlers, rip-off artists, and corporate thieves, winning the applause of his peers.\n\nBut along the way, he noticed that there was something far more troublesome going on: While the networks screamed about the dangers of coffee pots, worse risks were ignored.\n\nIn Give Me a Break, Stossel explains how ambitious bureaucrats, intellectually lazy reporters, and greedy lawyers make your life worse even as they claim to protect your interests. Taking on such sacred cows as the FDA, the War on Drugs, and scare-mongering environmental activists -- and backing up his trademark irreverence with careful reasoning and research -- he shows how the problems that government tries and fails to fix can be solved better by the extraordinary power of the free market.\n\nHe traces his journey from cub reporter to 20/20 co-anchor, revealing his battles to get his ideas to the public, his struggle to overcome stuttering, and his eventual realization that, for years, much of his reporting missed the point.\n\nStossel concludes the book with a modest proposal for change. It's a simple plan in the spirit of the Founding Fathers to ensure that America remains a place &quot;where free minds -- and free markets -- make good things happen.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d71ae62d923948d81b04e4fac03f4691950ed29","amp;dn":"John+Stossel+-+Give+Me+A+Break+-+How+I+Exposed...+%5B96%5D+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d71ae62d923948d81b04e4fac03f4691950ed29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,113,174,98,217,35,148,141,129,176,78,79,172,3,244,105,25,80,237,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
