His repertoire is unbelievable.&quot;\nThe Village Voice\n\nJody Stecher has long been AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s least generic flatpicker. \n\nFrom the teenage hotshot who won the 1966 WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Champion \n\nFlatpicking Cup at Union Grove North Carolina to the mature and \n\nreflective artist who was twice Grammy nominated in the 1990s, \n\nJody has always played his own style. Here he presents the \n\ntechnical nuts and bolts for you to make your own personal style. \n\nThis DVD is both a roadmap of JodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s development as a flatpicking \n\nguitarist of mostly American vernacular music, and a guide to how \n\nany flatpicker can expand their expressive technique. Think of it \n\nas &quot;Flatpicking According to Jody&quot;. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a graded course starting with basics in which the technical \n\nrelationship between fingerpicking and flatpicking is made clear. \n\nThe first few pieces are great songs with memorable melodies but \n\nminimal fingering so that right hand fundamentals can be mastered. \n\nWith each new tune more techniques are introduced and more and \n\nmore fingerboard is used, both horizontally and vertically. The \n\nsecond half of the DVD is purely instrumental music and the tunes \n\nare more complex. \n\nTitles include: CarterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blues, ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hard To Love, I Got A \n\nBulldog, Leake County Blues, Arkansas Traveler, The Dawn and The \n\nShip in Full Sail","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146beeb2fd2ecd974373651e453c7e4a3cbe84e7","amp;dn":"Downhome+Flatpicking+Guitar+%28with+TAB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146beeb2fd2ecd974373651e453c7e4a3cbe84e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,107,238,178,253,46,205,151,67,115,101,30,69,60,126,74,60,190,132,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
