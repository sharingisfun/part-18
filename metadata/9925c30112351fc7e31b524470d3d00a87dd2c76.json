OscarÃ‚Â® winner Mercedes McCambridge (JOHNNY GUITAR) and Herbert Lom (THE DEAD ZONE, MARK OF THE DEVIL) co-star as the sadistic wardens of an island prison where abused yet luscious young lovelies surrender to their own depraved desires. Behind barsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦without menÃ¢â‚¬Â¦experience the unchained passion of 99 WOMEN! \n\nActors: Maria Schell, Luciana Paluzzi, Mercedes McCambridge, Herbert Lom, Maria Rohm\nDirectors: Jesus Franco\nWriters: Jesus Franco, Anya Corvin, Carlo Fadda, Harry Alan Towers, Javier PÃƒÂ©res Grober\nLanguage: English\nAspect Ratio: 1.66:1\nRated: Unrated\nStudio: Blue Underground, Inc.\nDVD Release Date: February 22, 2005\nRun Time: 86 minutes\n\nREVIEW:\n\nCredits: Mercedes McCambridge (Superintendent Thelma Diaz; Oscar nomination for &quot;Giant,&quot; won for &quot;All the King's Men&quot;), Maria Schell (Superintendent Leonie Caroll; &quot;The Odessa File&quot;), red-head Luciana Paluzzi (Natalie Mendoza), Rosalba Neri (Zoie; &quot;The Arena&quot;), Maria Rohm (Marie), Eliza Montes (Helga), Valentina Godoy (Rosalie), and Herbert Lom (Governor Santos; &quot;The Pope Must Die&quot;). Written by Peter Welbeck. Directed by Jess Franco (&quot;Incubus&quot; (2002)). Filmed on an island in the Mediterranean.\n\nPlot: The movie is about a female prison located on an island off the coast of Panama. The guards are &quot;sadistic&quot; (mostly occurs before the action or off-camera) and women are allowed to die (one shown). Also, forced lesbianism &quot;abounds&quot; (ok, once). Rumors float around saying that the new superintendent is a lesbian that is a little to close to the prisoners (spread by the ex-superintendent; their differences in discipline come into conflict). Attempting to escape these &quot;horrible&quot; conditions, three women flee (Marie (prisoner 99), Helga (prisoner 97), and Rosalie (short red-headed girl)). But one dies and the escaped prisoners are recaptured. The prison erupts after the women are returned (not necessarily for that reason).\n\nReview: Interesting, the unrated director's cut of a movie that was originally released as an X rated film with an original run time of 70 minutes (odd, both of my movie guides state that the film is around 90 minutes long and rated R (one believes it is a turkey)). If I'm reading the DVD correctly, the unrated version adds about 20 minutes of footage (but if my movie guides are correct, then no additional minutes are added). One of the movie extras includes a news article about the film that notes that it is X rated and 70 minutes long, so I'm not sure what the real film length and rating was.\n\nGood opening music. A relatively slow movie, takes a while to get going (especially since they cut out the normal &quot;strip-search inspection&quot; of the new prisoners). The prisoners wear the normal skimpy uniforms and girl fights occur, but the first nudity does not occur until around 23 minutes into the film. The director is an &quot;artiste,&quot; and most of the &quot;nude&quot; sequences are artistically out of focus, or otherwise barely visible or very short (a shame considering some of the women are attractive). The director also keeps annoyingly moving from out of focus to very close up shots in these types of scenes. A very disappointing movie, I should have paid attention to the critics (though they had seen the original film, not the &quot;director's cut&quot;). As a &quot;mainstream&quot; movie it is disappointing, and as a &quot;nudie pic&quot; it is very disappointing. Some of the actors, though, do seem to be able to act (though the new superintendent smiles too much, and prisoner 99 cries too much).\n\nA very slow movie with surprisingly few nude scenes, and a lot less violence and sadistic guard action. Going by the interview with the director, it would appear that the &quot;unrated&quot; version that I watched was actually one of the &quot;softer&quot; versions of the film (oh, and don't skip that interview, some of the missing &quot;harder&quot; scenes are included). The harder scenes were made by others and inserted into the film later (there are many versions of this film; and apparently one of the versions was at the top of the US box office at one point).\n\n\n[img]http://picturestack.com/826/833/t6y99WomenAtoDQZ.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://picturestack.com/826/833/6S899WomenAtoXtR.jpg[/img] ..
