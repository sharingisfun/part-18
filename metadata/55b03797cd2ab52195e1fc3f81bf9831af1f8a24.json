Much better digital topo data, street names, etc. than previous v2002 Garmin US Topo product. This is my contribution in return for the Canada and US 24k Nat&amp;#039;l Parks Topo Maps, which I would never have been able to afford as I really needed only subsections of them! I hope this enables some geocachers somewhere to do some extra good hides!\n\nThere is no unlock code required.\n\nWill install fully to PC so no DVD required in drive while using MapSource.\n\nBTW, this version has Land elevation contours with elevation shading on the PC.\n\nAll of USA including Alaska and Hawaii will fit on a 4 GB micro SD card with about 3/4 of a GB to spare, if transferred in chunks or manually.
