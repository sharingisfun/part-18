The sound quality is very good and the quartet -- with Dodo Marmarosa on piano, Red Callender on bass, and Harold &quot;Doc&quot; West on drums -- is first-rate. This will be a collection that only completists or Wardell Gray freaks must own.&quot; ~ Michael G. Nastos, All Music Guide\n\n\n&quot;On November 23, 1946, tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray recorded five numbers with pianist Dodo Marmarosa, bassist Red Callender and drummer Chuck Thompson. This CD has 16 performances in all, the original five tunes plus 11 alternate takes (including five versions of &quot;How High the Moon,&quot; which was retitled at the time as &quot;One For Prez&quot;). The playing is excellent, but the repetition of titles makes the set of primary interest to completists rather than casual listeners.&quot; ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d417244d8bb013ada7ab2bc7c22c77bcca207d1","amp;dn":"Wardell+vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d417244d8bb013ada7ab2bc7c22c77bcca207d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,65,114,68,216,187,1,58,218,122,178,188,124,34,199,123,204,162,7,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
