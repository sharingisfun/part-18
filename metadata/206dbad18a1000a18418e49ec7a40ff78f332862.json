Challenges relevant to the scaling of CMOS Nanoelectronics are addressed through the different Core CMOS and Memory Devices options in the first part of the book. The second part reviews the New device Concepts for Nanoelectronics Beyond CMOS. What are the fundamental limits of core CMOS, and can we improve the scaling by the introduction of new materials or processes? Will the new architectures using SOI, multigates, or multichannels improve the trade-off between performance and power consumption and relax the constraints of new material integration? Can quantum computing replace binary-based protocols to enhance the information processing power? These questions and others are answered in this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:206dbad18a1000a18418e49ec7a40ff78f332862","amp;dn":"Electronic+Device+Architectures+for+the+Nano-CMOS+ERA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"206dbad18a1000a18418e49ec7a40ff78f332862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,109,186,209,138,16,0,161,132,24,228,158,199,164,15,247,143,51,40,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
